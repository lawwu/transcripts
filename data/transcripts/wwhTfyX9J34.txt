[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   So you have an original life event.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.560]   It evolves for four billion years, at least on our planet.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.160]   It evolves a technosphere.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.200]   The technologies themselves start having this property
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.960]   we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.240]   It solves the origin of itself,
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.980]   and then it figures out how that process all works,
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.360]   understands how to make more life,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   and then can copy itself onto another planet,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.560]   so the whole structure can reproduce itself.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.080]   - The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.120]   her third time on this podcast.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.840]   She is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.000]   interested in the origin of life
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.640]   and in discovering alien life on other worlds.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000]   She has written an amazing new upcoming book
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.240]   titled "Life as No One Knows It,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.840]   "The Physics of Life's Emergence."
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560]   This book is coming out on August 6th,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.200]   so please go pre-order it now.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.640]   It will blow your mind.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.400]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.260]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.740]   in the description.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.440]   And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.700]   You opened the book "Life as No One Knows It,
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.360]   "The Physics of Life's Emergence,"
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.400]   with a distinction between the materialists
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.920]   and the vitalists, so what's the difference?
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.480]   Can you maybe define the two?
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.560]   - I think the question there is about
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.580]   whether life can be described
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.860]   in terms of matter and physical things,
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.720]   or whether there is some other feature
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.120]   that's not physical that actually animates living things.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.120]   So for a long time, people maybe have called that a soul.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.800]   It's been really hard to pin down what that is.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.080]   So I think the vitalist idea is really
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.000]   that it's kind of a dualistic interpretation
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480]   that there's sort of the material properties,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.900]   but there's something else that animates life
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.640]   that is there when you're alive,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.360]   and it's not there when you're dead.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.760]   And materialists kind of don't think
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.920]   that there's anything really special
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.240]   about the matter of life and the material substrates
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.620]   that life is made out of.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.320]   So they disagree on some really fundamental points.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.520]   - Is there a gray area between the two?
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.360]   Like maybe all there is is matter,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720]   but there's so much we don't know
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.360]   that it might as well be magic.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.040]   That like whatever that magic that the vitalists see.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.340]   Meaning like there's just so much mystery
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.940]   that it's really unfair to say
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.780]   that it's boring and understood
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.860]   and as simple as quote-unquote physics.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.920]   - Yeah, I think the entire universe is just a giant mystery.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.260]   I guess that's what motivates me as a scientist.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.440]   And so oftentimes when I look at open problems
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.620]   like the nature of life or consciousness
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.940]   or what is intelligence or are there souls
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.260]   or whatever question that we have
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.460]   that we feel like we aren't even
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.860]   on the tip of answering yet,
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.140]   I think we have a lot more work to do
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.700]   to really understand the answers to these questions.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.900]   So it's not magic, it's just the unknown.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.380]   And I think a lot of the history
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.720]   of humans coming to understand the world around us
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.340]   has been taking ideas that we once thought
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.360]   were magic or supernatural
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.980]   and really understanding them in a much deeper way
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.700]   that we learn what those things are.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.500]   And they still have an air of mystery
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.020]   even when we understand them.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.580]   There's no sort of bottom to our understanding.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.700]   - So do you think the vitalists have a point
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.820]   that they're more eager and able
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.180]   to notice the magic of life?
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.620]   - I think that no tradition, vitalists included,
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.820]   is ever fully wrong about the nature
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.580]   of the things that they're describing.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.220]   So a lot of times when I look at different ways
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.660]   that people have described things
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.220]   across human history, across different cultures,
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.860]   there's always a seed of truth in them.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.260]   And I think it's really important to try to look for those
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.380]   because if there are narratives
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.820]   that humans have been telling ourselves
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.640]   for thousands of years, for thousands of generations,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.500]   there must be some truth to them.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.460]   We've been learning about reality for a really long time
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.740]   and we recognize the patterns that reality presents us.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.380]   We don't always understand what those patterns are.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.500]   And so I think it's really important
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.380]   to pay attention to that.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.180]   So I don't think the vitalists were actually wrong.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.260]   And a lot of what I talk about in the book,
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.340]   but also I think about a lot just professionally,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.940]   is the nature of our definitions of what's material
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.540]   and how science has come to invent the concept of matter.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.100]   And that some of those things actually really are inventions
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.620]   that happened in a particular time
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.540]   in a particular technology
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.940]   that could learn about certain patterns
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.420]   and help us understand them.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.380]   And that there are some patterns we still don't understand.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.660]   And if we knew how to measure those things
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.100]   or we knew how to describe them in a more rigorous way,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.260]   we would realize that the material world, matter,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.140]   has more properties than we thought that it did.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.620]   And one of those might be associated
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.640]   with the thing that we call life.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.620]   Life could be a material property
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.840]   and still have a lot of the features
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.940]   that the vitalists thought were mysterious.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.340]   - So we may still expand our understanding
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.220]   what is incorporated in the category of matter.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.380]   That will eventually incorporate such magical things
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.300]   that the vitalists have noticed.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.780]   - Yeah. - Like life.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.340]   - Yeah, so I think about,
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.100]   I always like to use examples from physics,
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.740]   so I'll probably do that to like,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.660]   like it's just my go-to place.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.420]   But in the history of gravitational physics,
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.120]   for example, in the history of motion,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.220]   when Aristotle came up with his theories of motion,
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.780]   he did it by the material properties he thought things had.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.800]   So there was a concept of things falling to earth
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.780]   because they were solid-like
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.140]   and things raising to the heavens 'cause they were air-like
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.660]   and things moving around the planet
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.500]   'cause they were celestial-like.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.420]   But then we came to realize that thousands of years later
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.580]   and after the invention of many technologies
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.180]   that allowed us to actually measure time
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.740]   in a mechanistic way and track planetary motion,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.700]   and we could roll balls down incline planes
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.020]   and track that progress,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.220]   we realized that if we just talked about mass
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.320]   and acceleration, we could unify all motion in the universe
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.540]   in a really simple description.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.440]   So we didn't really have to worry about the fact
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.000]   that my cup is heavy and the air is light.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.680]   Like the same laws describe them.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.400]   If we have the right material properties
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.040]   to talk about what those laws are actually interacting with.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.000]   And so I think the issue with life
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.940]   is we don't know how to think about information
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.480]   in a material way.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.200]   And so we haven't been able to build a unified description
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   of what life is or the kind of things that evolution builds
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.000]   because we haven't really invented
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.080]   the right material concept yet.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.200]   - So when talking about motion,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.520]   the laws of physics appear to be the same
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.560]   everywhere out in the universe.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.600]   You think the same is true for other kinds of matter
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.840]   that we might eventually include life in?
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.720]   - I think life obeys universal principles.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.440]   I think there is some deep underlying explanatory framework
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.000]   that will tell us about the nature of life in the universe
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.440]   and will allow us to identify life
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.280]   that we can't yet recognize because it's too different.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.600]   - You're right about the paradox of defining life.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.480]   Why does it seem to be so easy
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.320]   and so complicated at the same time?
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.600]   - You know, all the sort of classic definitions
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.240]   people want to use just don't work.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.560]   They don't work in all cases.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.040]   So Carl Sagan had this wonderful essay
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.520]   on definitions of life where I think he talks about
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   aliens coming from another planet.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.600]   If they saw Earth, they might think that cars
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.880]   were the dominant life form
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.240]   because there's so many of them on our planet.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.680]   And like humans are inside them
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.360]   and you might want to exclude machines,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.600]   but any definition, you know,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.880]   like classic biology textbook definitions
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.000]   would also include them.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.140]   And so, you know, he wanted to draw a boundary
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.140]   between these kinds of things by trying to exclude them,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.480]   but they were naturally included by the definitions
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.320]   people want to give.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.800]   And in fact, what he ended up pointing out
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   is that all of the definitions of life that we have,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.960]   whether it's life is a self-reproducing system
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.640]   or life eats to survive or life requires compartments,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.520]   whatever it is, there's always a counter example
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.040]   that challenges that definition.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.600]   This is why viruses are so hard or why fire is so hard.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.000]   And so we've had a really hard time trying to pin down
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.640]   from a definitional perspective exactly what life is.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.020]   - Yeah, you actually bring up the zombie ant fungus.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.500]   I enjoyed looking at this thing
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.940]   as an example of one of the challenges.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.300]   You mentioned viruses, but this is a parasite.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   Look at that.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.540]   - Did you see this in the jungle?
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.460]   - Infects ants.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.660]   Actually, one of the interesting things about the jungle,
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.820]   everything is ephemeral.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.700]   Like everything eats everything really quickly.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.680]   So if an organism dies, that organism disappears.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.320]   - Yeah.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.180]   - It's a machine that doesn't have,
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.160]   I wanted to say it doesn't have a memory or a history,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.000]   which is interesting given your work on history
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.520]   in defining a living being.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.080]   The jungle forgets very quickly.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   It wants to erase the fact that you existed very quickly.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.600]   - Yeah, but it can't erase it.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.720]   It's just restructuring it.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.500]   And I think the other thing that is really vivid to me
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.360]   about this example that you're giving
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.120]   is how much death is necessary for life.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   So I worry a bit about notions of immortality
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   and whether immortality is a good thing or not.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.200]   So I have sort of a broad conception
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.040]   that life is the only thing the universe generates
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.600]   that actually has even the potential to be immortal.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.880]   But that's as like the sort of process
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.000]   that you're describing where life is about memory
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.520]   and historical contingency and construction
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.940]   of new possibilities.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.700]   But when you look at any instance of life,
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.860]   especially one as dynamic as what you're describing,
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.180]   it's a constant birth and death process.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.420]   But that birth and death process is like
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.660]   the way that the universe can explore
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.740]   what possibilities can exist and not everything,
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.820]   not every possible human or every possible ant
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.780]   or every possible zombie ant
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.980]   or every possible tree will ever live.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.520]   So it's an incredibly dynamic and creative place
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.920]   because of all that death.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.360]   - So does this thing, this is a parasite that needs the ant.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   So is this a living thing or is this not a living thing?
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.940]   So this is, it just pierces the ant.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.680]   I mean, it-- - Right.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.080]   - And I've seen a lot of this, by the way.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.560]   Organisms working together in the jungle,
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.260]   like ants protecting a delicious piece of fruit.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.480]   So they need the fruit, but like if you touch that fruit,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.640]   they're going to, like the forces emerge.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.080]   They're fighting you, they're defending that fruit.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.840]   - Right. - To the death.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.080]   It's just nature seems to find mutual benefits, right?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.480]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.360]   I think the thing that's perplexing for me
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.680]   about these kind of examples is,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.440]   effectively the ant's dead, but it's staying alive now
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.720]   'cause it's piloted by this fungus.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.680]   And so that gets back to this thing
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.760]   that we were talking about a few minutes ago
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.880]   about how the boundary of life is really hard to define.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.560]   So, you know, anytime that you want to draw a boundary
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.360]   around something and you say,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.600]   this feature is the thing that makes this alive,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.340]   or this thing is alive on its own,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.680]   there's not ever really a clear boundary.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.160]   And these kind of examples are really good at showing that
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.800]   because it's like the thing that you would have thought
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.480]   is the living organism is now dead,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   except that it has another living organism
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.340]   that's piloting it.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.880]   So the two of them together are alive in some sense,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.460]   but they're now in this kind of weird symbiotic relationship
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.240]   that's taking this ant to its death.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.400]   - So what do you do with that
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.840]   in terms of when you try to define life?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.280]   - I think we have to get rid of the notion
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.040]   of an individual as being relevant.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.520]   And this is really difficult because, you know,
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.320]   a lot of the ways that we think about life,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.240]   like the fundamental unit of life is the cell,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   individuals are alive,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.520]   but we don't think about how gray that distinction is.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.520]   So for example, you might consider, you know,
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.440]   self-reproduction to be the most defining feature of life.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.920]   A lot of people do actually like, you know,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.760]   one of these standard different definitions
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.160]   that a lot of people may feel like to use in astrobiology
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.420]   is life as a self-sustaining chemical system
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.300]   capable of Darwinian evolution,
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.980]   which I was once quoted as agreeing with,
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.560]   and I was really offended because I hate that definition.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.760]   I think it's terrible.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.640]   And I think it's terrible that people use it.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.080]   I think like every word in that definition
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.520]   is actually wrong as a descriptor of life.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.720]   - Life is a self-sustaining chemical system
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.160]   capable of Darwinian evolution.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.000]   Why is that?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.840]   That seems like a pretty good definition.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.660]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.700]   If you wanna make me angry, you can pretend I said that.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.760]   (laughing)
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.920]   And believed it.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.160]   - So self-sustaining chemical system,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.280]   Darwinian evolution, what is self-sustaining?
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.840]   What's so frustrating?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.300]   I mean, which aspect is frustrating to you?
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.320]   But it's also those very interesting words.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.720]   - Yeah, they're all interesting words.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.800]   And, you know, together they sound really smart
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.720]   and they sound like they box in what life is,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.680]   but you can use any of the words individually
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.060]   and you can come up with counterexamples
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.960]   that don't fulfill that property.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.840]   The self-sustaining one is really interesting
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.280]   thinking about humans, right?
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.440]   Like we're not self-sustaining,
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.160]   we're dependent on societies.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160]   And so, you know, I find it paradoxical
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.720]   that it might be that societies,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.260]   because they're self-sustaining units,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.980]   are now more alive than individuals are.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.200]   And that could be the case,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.280]   but I still think we have some property
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.220]   associated with life.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.680]   I mean, that's the thing that we're trying to describe.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.400]   So that one's quite hard.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.080]   And in general, you know,
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.320]   no organism is really self-sustaining.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.600]   They always require an environment.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.240]   So being self-sustaining is coupled in some sense
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.500]   to the world around you.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.460]   We don't live in a vacuum.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.740]   So that part's already challenging.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.080]   And then you can go to chemical system.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.160]   I don't think that's good either.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.760]   I think there's a confusion
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.820]   because life emerges in chemistry,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.080]   that life is chemical.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.440]   I don't think life is chemical.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.600]   I think life emerges in chemistry
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.400]   because chemistry is the first thing the universe builds,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.020]   where it cannot exhaust all the possibilities
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.680]   because the combinatorial space of chemistry is too large.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.040]   - Well, but is it possible to have a life
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.600]   that is not a chemical system?
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.560]   - Yes.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.520]   - There's a guy I know named Lee Cronin
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.120]   has been on a podcast a couple of times
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.280]   who just got really pissed off listening to this.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.440]   He probably just got really pissed off hearing
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.500]   that for people who somehow don't know he's a chemist.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.380]   - Yeah, but he would agree with that statement.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.300]   - Would he?
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.700]   I don't think he would.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.740]   I don't think he would.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.860]   He would broaden the definition of chemistry
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.140]   until it would include everything.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.100]   - Oh, sure.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.940]   - Okay, so you--
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.760]   - Or maybe, I don't know.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.160]   - But wait, but you said that universe,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.920]   that's the first thing it creates is chemistry.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.540]   - Where the, very precisely,
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.540]   it's not the first thing it creates.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.380]   Obviously, it has to make atoms first,
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.580]   but it's the first thing.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.100]   If you think about the universe originated,
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.240]   atoms were made in Big Bang nucleosynthesis
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.400]   and then later in stars, and then planets formed,
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.100]   and planets become engines of chemistry.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.500]   They start exploring what kind of chemistry is possible,
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   and the combinatorial space of chemistry is so large
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.400]   that even on every planet in the entire universe,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.740]   you will never express every possible molecule.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.720]   I like this example, actually, that Lee gave me,
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.960]   which is to think about taxol.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.920]   It has a molecular weight of about 853.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.180]   It's got a lot of atoms, but it's not astronomically large,
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:55.180]   and if you tried to make one molecule
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.320]   with that molecular formula
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.120]   and every three-dimensional shape you could make
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.540]   with that molecular formula,
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:05.540]   it would fill 1.5 universes in volume,
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.260]   so with one unique molecule.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.560]   That's just one molecule, so chemical space is huge,
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.280]   and I think it's really important to recognize that
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.520]   because if you wanna ask a question
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.680]   of why does life emerge in chemistry,
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.000]   well, life emerges in chemistry
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.760]   because life is the physics
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.120]   of how the universe selects what gets to exist,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.560]   and those things get created
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.440]   along historically contingent pathways in memory
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.920]   and all the other stuff that we can talk about,
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.120]   but the universe has to actually make
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.040]   historically contingent choices in chemistry
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.300]   'cause it can't exhaust all possible molecules.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.960]   - What kind of things can you create
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.040]   that's outside the combinatorial space of chemistry?
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.080]   That's what I'm trying to understand.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.800]   - Oh, if it's not chemical,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.760]   so I think some of the things
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.720]   that have evolved in our biosphere
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   I would call as much alive as chemistry, as a cell,
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.400]   but they seem much more abstract,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.880]   so for example, I think language is alive,
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   I think, or at least life, I think memes are, I think--
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.720]   - You're saying language is life.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.240]   - Yes. - Language is alive.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.720]   - Oh boy, we're gonna have to explore that one.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.840]   (Rebekah laughing)
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.000]   Okay, but-- - Life maybe not,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.640]   maybe not alive, but I actually don't know
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   where I stand exactly on that.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.480]   I've been thinking about that a little bit more lately,
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.360]   but mathematics too, and it's interesting
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.720]   'cause people think that math has this platonic reality
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.240]   that exists outside of our universe,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.640]   and I think it's a feature of our biosphere,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.200]   and it's telling us something
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.960]   about the structure of our cells,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.560]   and I find that really interesting
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.040]   'cause when you would sort of internalize
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.120]   all of these things that we notice about the world,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.880]   and you start asking, well, what do these look like
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.120]   if I was something outside of myself
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.200]   observing these systems that we're all embedded in,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.760]   what would that structure look like?
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.240]   And I think we look really different
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.480]   than the way that we talk about
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.160]   what we look like to each other.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.600]   - What do you think a living organism in math is?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.560]   Is it one axiomatic system, or is it individual theorems,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.880]   or is it-- - I think it's the fact
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.200]   that it's open-ended in some sense.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.920]   It's another open-ended combinatorial space,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.960]   and the recursive properties of it
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.040]   allow creativity to happen,
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.760]   which is what you see with the revolution in the last century
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.600]   with Godel's theorem and Turing,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.520]   and there's clear places where mathematics
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.840]   notices holes in the universe. (laughs)
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.440]   - So it seems like you're sneaking up
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.040]   on a different kind of definition of life,
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.440]   open-ended, large combinatorial space.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   - Yeah. - Room for creativity.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.080]   - Definitely not chemical.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.920]   I mean, chemistry is one substrate.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.760]   - Restricted to chemical. - Yeah.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.280]   - Okay, what about the third thing,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.040]   which I think would be the hardest,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.680]   'cause you probably like it the most,
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.800]   is evolution or selection.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.440]   - Well, specifically, it's Darwinian evolution,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.960]   and I think Darwinian evolution is a problem,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.280]   but the reason that that definition is a problem
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.400]   is not because evolution is in the definition,
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.120]   but because the implication is that,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.080]   that most people would wanna make
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.960]   is that an individual is alive,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.720]   and the evolutionary process,
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.240]   at least the Darwinian evolutionary process,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.400]   most evolutionary processes,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.280]   they don't happen at the level of individuals.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.840]   They happen at the level of populations.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.040]   So again, you would be saying something
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.360]   like what we saw with the self-sustaining definition,
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.800]   which is that populations are alive,
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.680]   but individuals aren't,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.920]   because populations evolve and individuals don't,
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.960]   and obviously, maybe you're alive
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.640]   because your gut microbiome is evolving,
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.480]   but Lex is an entity right now,
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.440]   is not evolving by canonical theories of evolution.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.280]   In assembly theory, which is attempting to explain life,
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.680]   evolution is a much broader thing.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.720]   - So an individual organism
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.480]   can evolve under assembly theory?
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.840]   - Yes, you're constructing yourself all the time.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.600]   Assembly theory is about construction
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.920]   and how the universe selects for things to exist.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.560]   - What if you formulate everything
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.800]   like a population is a living organism?
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.400]   - That's fine, too.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.840]   But this again gets back to,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.200]   so I think what all of the,
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.520]   we can nitpick at definitions.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.680]   I don't think it's incredibly helpful to do it,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.760]   but the reason for me-- - But it's fun.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.600]   - Yeah, it is fun.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.440]   It is really fun.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.760]   And actually, I do think it's useful
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.480]   in the sense that when you see
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.200]   the ways that they all break down,
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.000]   you either have to keep forcing in
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.360]   your sort of conception of life you want to have,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.880]   or you have to say all these definitions
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.040]   are breaking down for a reason.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.120]   Maybe I should adopt a more expansive definition
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.880]   that encompasses all the things that I think are life.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.560]   And so for me, I think life is the process
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.200]   of how information structures matter over time and space.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.680]   And an example of life is what emerges on a planet
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.160]   and yields an open-ended cascade
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.680]   of generation of structure and increasing complexity.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.080]   And this is the thing that life is.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.960]   And any individual is just a particular instance
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   of these lineages that are structured across time.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.360]   And so we focus so much on these individuals
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.120]   that are these short temporal moments
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.080]   in this larger causal structure
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.000]   that actually is the life on our planet.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.560]   And I think that's why these definitions break down,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.760]   because they're not general enough,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.520]   they're not universal enough, they're not deep enough,
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520]   they're not abstract enough
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.400]   to actually capture that regularity.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.920]   - 'Cause we're focused on those,
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.760]   that little ephemeral thing that we call human life.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.200]   - Aristotle focusing on heavy things falling
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.400]   because they're earth-like,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.520]   and things floating 'cause they're air-like.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.080]   It's the wrong thing to focus on.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.680]   - So what exactly are we missing
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.560]   by focusing on such a short span of time?
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.360]   - I think we're missing most of what we are.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.280]   So one of the issues,
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.600]   I've been thinking about this really viscerally lately.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.160]   It's weird when you do theoretical physics,
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.680]   'cause I think it literally changes
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.400]   the structure of your brain,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.960]   and you see the world differently,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.880]   especially when you're trying to build new abstractions.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.800]   - Do you think it's possible,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   if you're a theoretical physicist,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.960]   it's easy to fall off the cliff
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.240]   and go descend into madness?
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.040]   - I mean, I think you're always on the edge of it,
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.520]   but I think what is amazing about being a scientist
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   and trying to do things rigorously is it keeps your sanity.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.240]   So I think if I wasn't a theoretical physicist,
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.600]   I would be probably not sane.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.840]   But what it forces you to do is hold the fire.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.240]   You have to hold yourself to the fire
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.600]   of these abstractions in my mind
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.440]   have to really correspond to reality,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.600]   and I have to really test that all the time.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.680]   And so I love building new abstractions,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.440]   and I love going to those incredibly creative spaces
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.920]   that people don't see
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.720]   as part of the way that we understand the world now.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.120]   But ultimately, I have to make sure
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.840]   that whatever I'm pulling from that space
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.480]   is something that's really usable
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.560]   and really relates to the world outside of me.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.680]   That's what science is.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.160]   - So we were talking about what we're missing
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.200]   when we look at a small stretch of time
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.600]   and a small stretch of space.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.480]   - Yeah, so the issue is we evolve perception
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.040]   to see reality a certain way, right?
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.280]   So for us, space is really important,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.800]   and time feels fleeting.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.880]   And I had a really wonderful mentor, Paul Davies,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.720]   most of my career.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.080]   And Paul's amazing because he gives these
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.720]   little seed thought experiments all the time.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.360]   Something he used to ask me all the time
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.480]   when I was a postdoc, this is kind of a random tangent,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.000]   but was how much of the universe
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   could be converted into technology
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.040]   if you were thinking about long-term futures
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.880]   and stuff like that.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.320]   And it's a weird thought experiment,
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.520]   but there's a lot of deep things there.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.840]   And I do think a lot about the fact
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.640]   that we're really limited in our interactions with reality
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.040]   by the particular architectures that we evolved.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.400]   And so we're not seeing everything.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.760]   And in fact, our technology tells us this all the time
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.200]   because it allows us to see the world in new ways
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   by basically allowing us to perceive the world
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   in ways that we couldn't otherwise.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.520]   And so what I'm getting at with this is
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.520]   I think that living objects are actually huge.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.000]   Like they're some of the biggest structures in the universe,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.800]   but they are not big in space, they are big in time.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.480]   And we actually can't resolve that feature.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   We don't interact with it on a regular basis.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.400]   So we see them as these fleeting things
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.720]   that have this really short temporal clock time
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.760]   without seeing how large they are.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.400]   When I'm saying time here, I really,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.920]   like the way that people could picture it
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.360]   is in terms of causal structure.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.160]   So if you think about the history of the universe
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.320]   to get to you, and you imagine
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.880]   that that entire history is you,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.240]   that is the picture I have in my mind
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.000]   when I look at every living thing.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.680]   - So you have a tweet for everything.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.800]   You tweeted-- - Doesn't everyone?
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.960]   - You have a lot of poetic, profound tweets.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.240]   Sometimes they're puzzles
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.960]   that take a long time to figure out.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.600]   - Well, you know what the trick is?
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.840]   The reason they're hard to write
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.000]   is because it's compressing a very deep idea
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.800]   into a short amount of space.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.640]   And I really like doing that intellectual exercise
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.280]   'cause I find it productive for me.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.800]   - Yeah, it's a very interesting
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.040]   kind of compression algorithm though.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.960]   - Yeah, I like language.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.440]   I think it's really fun to play with.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.760]   - Yeah, I wonder if AI can decompress it.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.600]   That'd be interesting.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.760]   - I think, I would like to try this,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.680]   but I think I use language in certain ways
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.920]   that are non-canonical and I do it very purposefully.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.000]   And it would be interesting to me
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.720]   how AI would interpret it.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.800]   - Yeah, your tweets would be a good Turing test
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.080]   for superintelligence.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.720]   Anyway, you tweeted that things only look emergent
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.640]   because we can't see time.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.200]   So if we could see time,
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.520]   what would the world look like?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.740]   You're saying you'll be able to see
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.040]   everything that an object has been,
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.120]   every step of the way that led to this current moment
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.800]   and all the interactions
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.520]   that required to make that evolution happen.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.040]   You would see this gigantic tail.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   - The universe is far larger in time than it is in space.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.000]   - Yeah.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.720]   - And this planet is one of the biggest things
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.080]   in the universe.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.960]   - Oh, so the more complexity, the bigger--
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.160]   - Yeah, so like, yeah, technosphere.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.800]   I think the modern technosphere is the largest object
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.160]   in time in the universe that we know about.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.200]   - And when you say technosphere, what do you mean?
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.080]   - I mean the global integration of life
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.760]   and technology on this planet.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.640]   - So all the things,
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.160]   all the technological things we've created?
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.440]   - But I don't think of them as separate.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.040]   They're very integrated with the structure
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.440]   that generated them.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.160]   So you can almost imagine it,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.160]   time is constantly bifurcating
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.400]   and it's generating new structures
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   and these new structures are locally constructing the future.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.560]   And so things like you and I are very close together in time
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.600]   'cause we didn't diverge very early
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.440]   in the history of the universe.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.760]   It's very recent.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.280]   And I think this is one of the reasons
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.160]   that we can understand each other so well
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.600]   and we can communicate effectively.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.880]   And I might have some sense of what it feels like to be you,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.760]   but other organisms bifurcated from us in time earlier.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.800]   This is just the concept of phylogeny, right?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.280]   But if you take that deeper
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.920]   and you really think about that as the structure
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.120]   of the physics that generates life
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   and you take that very seriously,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.720]   all of that causation is still bundled up
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.800]   in the objects we observe today.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   And so you and I are close in this temporal structure,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.480]   but we're so close because we're really big
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.120]   and we only are very different
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.000]   in sort of like the most recent moments
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   in the time that's like embedded in us.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.560]   It's hard to use words to visualize what's in minds.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.360]   (laughing)
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.640]   I have such a hard time with this sometimes.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.040]   Actually, I was thinking of the way over here.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.280]   You have pictures in your brain
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.280]   and then they're hard to put into words,
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.720]   but I realized I always say I have a visual,
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.360]   but it's not actually I have a visual, it's I have a feeling
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.480]   'cause oftentimes I cannot actually draw a picture
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.600]   in my mind for the things that I say,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.000]   but sometimes they go through a picture
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.140]   before they get to words.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.560]   But I like experimenting with words
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.840]   because I think they help paint pictures.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.280]   - Yeah, it's again some kind of compressed feeling
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.860]   that you can query to get a sense
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.880]   of the bigger visualization that you have in mind.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.680]   It's just a really nice compression.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.880]   But I think the idea of this object
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.760]   that in it contains all the information
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.720]   about the history of an entity that you see now,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.400]   just trying to visualize that is pretty cool.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.320]   - Yeah.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.880]   - I mean, obviously the mind breaks down quickly
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.080]   as you step seconds and minutes back in time.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   But I guess it's just a gigantic object
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.120]   we're supposed to be thinking about.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.960]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.160]   And I think this is one of the reasons
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.200]   that we have such an ability to abstract as humans
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.880]   because we are so gigantic that like the space
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.180]   that we can go back into is really large.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.720]   So like the more abstract you're going,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.640]   like the deeper you're going in that space.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.320]   - But in that sense, aren't we fundamentally all connected?
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.880]   - Yes, and this is why the definition of life
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.320]   cannot be the individual, it has to be these lineages
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.960]   because they're all connected, they're interwoven
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.120]   and they're exchanging parts all the time.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.000]   - Yeah, so that maybe there's certain aspects
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.320]   of those lineages that can be lifelike,
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.360]   they can be characteristics,
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.080]   they can be measured like with the assembly theory
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.360]   that have more or less life,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.320]   but they're all just fingertips of a much bigger object.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.720]   - Yeah, I think life is very high dimensional.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.400]   And in fact, I think you can be alive in some dimensions
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.320]   and not in others.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.880]   Like if you could project all the causation that's in you
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.840]   and in some features of you,
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.480]   very little causation is required and like very little
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.860]   history and in some features a lot is.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.560]   So it's quite difficult to take this really high dimensional,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.360]   very deep structure and project it into things
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.320]   that we really can understand and say like,
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.480]   this is the one thing that we're seeing
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.600]   because it's not one thing.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.040]   - It's funny, we're talking about this now
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.160]   and I'm slowly starting to realize,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.020]   one of the things I saw when I took ayahuasca,
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.480]   afterwards actually.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.080]   So the actual ceremony is four or five hours,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.760]   but afterwards you're still riding
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.640]   whatever the thing that you're riding.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   And I got a chance to afterwards hang out with some friends
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.560]   and just shoot the shit in the forest.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.400]   And I get to see their faces.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.120]   And what was happening with their faces and their hair
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.240]   is I would get this interesting effect.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.560]   First of all, everything was beautiful
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.000]   and I just had so much love for everybody.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   But I could see their past selves like behind them.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.760]   It was this effect where I guess it's a blurring effect
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.200]   of where like if I move like this,
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   the faces that were just there are still there
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   and it would just float like this behind them,
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.160]   which will create this incredible effect.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.960]   But it's also another way to think about that
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   is I'm visualizing a little bit of that object,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.640]   of the thing they wore just a few seconds ago.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.000]   It's a cool little effect.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.840]   - That's very cool.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.540]   - And now it's like giving it a bit more profundity
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.300]   to the effect that was just beautiful aesthetically,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.120]   but it's also beautiful from a physics perspective
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.760]   because that is a past self.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.640]   I get a little glimpse at the past selves that they were,
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   but then you take that to its natural conclusion,
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.120]   not just a few seconds ago,
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.600]   but just to the beginning of the universe.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.520]   And you could probably get down that lineage.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.200]   - It's crazy that there's billions of years
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.320]   inside all of us.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.840]   - All of us.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.560]   And then we connect, obviously, not too long ago.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.840]   You mentioned just the technosphere
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.160]   and you also wrote that the most alive thing
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.520]   on this planet is our technosphere.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.360]   - Yeah.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.800]   - Why is the technology we create a kind of life form?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.480]   Why are you seeing it as life?
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.960]   - Because it's creative,
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.600]   but with us, obviously, like not independently of us.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.440]   And also because of this sort of lineage view of life.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.680]   And I think about life often as a planetary scale phenomena
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.240]   'cause that's sort of the natural boundary
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.780]   for all of this causation that's bundled
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.300]   in every object in our biosphere.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.600]   And so for me, it's just sort of the current boundary
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.040]   of how far life on our planet has pushed
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.280]   into the things that our universe can generate.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.800]   And so it's the furthest thing, it's the biggest thing.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.760]   And I think a lot about the nature of life
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.040]   across different scales.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:23.040]   And so we have cells inside of us that are alive
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.760]   and we feel like we're alive,
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.840]   but we don't often think about the societies
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.200]   that we're embedded in as alive
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.920]   or a global scale organization of us
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.960]   and our technology on the planet as alive.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   But I think if you have this deeper view
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.320]   into the nature of life, which I think is necessary also
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.440]   to solve the origin of life,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.200]   then you have to include those things.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.040]   - All of them.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.440]   So you have to simultaneously think about--
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.460]   - Every scale. - Life at every single scale.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.300]   - Yeah.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.640]   - The planetary and the bacteria level.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.320]   - Yeah, this is the hard thing
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.980]   about solving the problem of life, I think,
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.440]   is how many things you have to integrate
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.480]   into building a sort of a unified picture
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.040]   of this thing that we wanna call life.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.760]   And a lot of our theories of physics
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   are built on building deep regularities
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.760]   that explain a really broad class of phenomenon.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.200]   I think we haven't really traditionally thought
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.400]   about life that way.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.020]   But I think to get at some of these hardest questions,
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.640]   like looking for life on other planets
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.920]   or the origin of life, you really have
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.320]   to think about it that way.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.200]   And so most of my professional work
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.180]   is just trying to understand every single thing
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.240]   on this planet that might be an example of life,
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.440]   which is pretty much everything,
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.680]   and then trying to figure out
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.040]   what's the deeper structure underlying that.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.680]   - Yeah, Schrodinger wrote that living matter,
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.600]   while not eluding the laws of physics
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.240]   as established up to date,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.440]   is likely to involve other laws of physics,
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.080]   hitherto unknown.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.160]   So to him--
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.880]   - I love that quote.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.560]   - There was a sense that at the bottom of this
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.800]   are new laws of physics that could explain
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.880]   this thing that we call life.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.080]   - Yeah, Schrodinger really tried
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.000]   to do what physicists try to do,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.220]   which is explain things.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   And his attempt was to try to explain life
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.760]   in terms of non-equilibrium physics,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.540]   because he thought that was the best description
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.920]   that we could generate at the time.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.120]   And so he did come up with something really insightful,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.400]   which was to predict the structure of DNA
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.480]   as an aperiodic crystal.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.800]   And that was for a very precise reason,
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.080]   that was the only kind of physical structure
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.840]   that could encode enough information
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.480]   to actually specify a cell.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.080]   We knew some things about genes,
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.400]   but not about DNA and its actual structure
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.840]   when he proposed that.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.040]   But in the book, he tried to explain
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.280]   life as kind of going against entropy.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.300]   And so some people have talked about it
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.560]   as Schrodinger's paradox, how can life persist
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.480]   when the second law of thermodynamics is there?
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.120]   But in open systems, that's not so problematic.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.000]   And really the question is,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.240]   why can life generate so much order?
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.000]   And we don't have a physics to describe that.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.360]   And it's interesting, generations of physicists
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.680]   have thought about this problem.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.280]   Oftentimes, it's like when people are retiring,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.200]   they're like, "Oh, now I can work on life."
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.520]   Or they're more senior in their career
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.360]   and they've worked on other more traditional problems.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.200]   And there's still a lot of impetus in the physics community
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.400]   to think that non-equilibrium physics will explain life.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.380]   But I think that's not the right approach.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.280]   I don't think ultimately the solution
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.400]   to what life is, is there.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.480]   And I don't really think entropy has much to do with it
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.000]   unless it's entirely reformulated.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.160]   - Well, 'cause you have to explain how interesting order,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.240]   how complexity emerges from the soup.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.040]   - Yes, from randomness.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.960]   - From randomness.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.560]   Physics currently can't do that.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.720]   - No, physics hardly even acknowledges
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.680]   that the universe is random at its base.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.480]   We like to think we live in a deterministic universe
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.640]   and everything's deterministic,
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.480]   but I think that's probably an artifact
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.080]   of the way that we've written down laws of physics
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.360]   since Newton invented modern physics
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.220]   in his conception of motion and gravity,
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:17.120]   which he formulated laws that had initial conditions
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.400]   and fixed dynamical laws.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.240]   And that's been sort of become the standard canon
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.800]   of how people think the universe works
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   and how we need to describe any physical system
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.600]   is with an initial condition and a law of motion.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.760]   And I think that's not actually
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.160]   the way the universe really works.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.920]   I think it's a good approximation for the kind of systems
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.960]   that physicists have studied so far.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.680]   And I think it will radically fail in the longterm
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   at describing reality at its more basal levels.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.440]   I'm not saying there's a base.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.520]   I don't think that reality has a ground.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.680]   And I don't think there's a theory of everything,
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.280]   but I think there are better theories
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.480]   and I think there are more explanatory theories.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.640]   And I think we can get to something
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.300]   that explains much more than the current laws of physics do.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.440]   - When you say theory of everything,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.360]   you mean like everything, everything.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.720]   - Yeah, you know, like in physics right now,
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.960]   it's really popular to talk about theories of everything.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.600]   So string theory is supposed to be a theory of everything
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.640]   because it unifies quantum mechanics and gravity.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.960]   And people have their different pet theories of everything.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.440]   And the challenge with a theory of everything,
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.960]   I really love this quote from David Krakauer,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.240]   which is a theory of everything
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.200]   is a theory of everything
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.920]   except those things that theorize.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.360]   - Oh, you mean removing the observer from the thing.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.320]   - Yeah, but it's also weird
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.800]   because if a theory of everything explained everything,
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.380]   it should also explain the theory.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.480]   So the theory has to be recursive.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.040]   And none of our theories of physics are recursive.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.280]   So it's a weird concept.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.200]   - Yeah, but it's very difficult
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.520]   to integrate the observer into a theory.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.800]   - I don't think so.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.120]   I think you can build a theory
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.880]   acknowledging that you're an observer inside the universe.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.360]   - But doesn't it become recursive in that way?
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.960]   And you're saying it's possible
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.200]   to make a theory that's okay with that?
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.080]   - I think so.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   I mean, I don't think,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.520]   there's always gonna be the paradox of another metal level
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.440]   you could build on the metal level, right?
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.080]   So like if you assume this is your universe
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.700]   and you're the observer outside of it,
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.280]   you have some meta description of that universe,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.560]   but then you need a meta description
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.040]   of you describing that universe, right?
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:22.040]   So this is one of the biggest challenges that we face
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.320]   being observers inside our universe.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.560]   And also why the paradoxes
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.880]   and the foundations of mathematics
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.640]   and any place that we try to have observers in the system
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.380]   or a system describing itself show up.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.240]   But I think it is possible to build a physics
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.480]   that builds in those things intrinsically
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.360]   without having them be paradoxical
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   or have holes in the descriptions.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.120]   And so one place I think about this quite a lot,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.840]   which I think can give you sort of a more concrete example
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.920]   is the nature of like what we call fundamental.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.080]   So we typically define fundamental right now
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.480]   in terms of the smallest indivisible units of matter.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.680]   So again, you have to have a definition
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.560]   of what you think material is and matter is.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.720]   But right now, what's fundamental are elementary particles.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.480]   And we think they're fundamental
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.120]   because we can't break them apart further.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.020]   And obviously we have theories like string theory
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.560]   that if they're right, would replace the current description
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.480]   of what's the most fundamental thing in our universe
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.440]   by replacing it with something smaller.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.120]   But we can't get to those theories
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.280]   because we're technologically limited.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   And so if you look at this from a historical perspective
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.760]   and you think about explanations changing
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.320]   as physical systems like us,
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.520]   learn more about the reality in which they live.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.920]   We once considered atoms to be the most fundamental thing.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.640]   And it literally comes from the word indivisible.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.440]   And then we realized atoms had substructure
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.160]   because we built better technology,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.800]   which allowed us to "see the world better"
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.840]   and resolve smaller features of it.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.400]   And then we built even better technology,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.600]   which allowed us to see even smaller structure
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.280]   and get down to the standard model particles.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.880]   And we think that there might be structure below that,
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.200]   but we can't get there yet with our technology.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.480]   So what's fundamental, the way we talk about it
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   in current physics is not actually fundamental.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.680]   It's the boundaries of what we can observe in our universe,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.760]   what we can see with our technology.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.200]   And so if you wanna build a theory that's about us
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.960]   and about what's inside the universe
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.240]   that we can observe, not what's at the boundary of it,
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.160]   you need to talk about objects that are in the universe
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.840]   that you can actually break apart to smaller things.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.280]   So I think the things that are fundamental
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.800]   are actually the constructed objects.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.080]   They're the ones that really exist
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.480]   and you really understand their properties
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.240]   because you know how the universe constructed them
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.920]   because you can actually take them apart.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.480]   You can understand the intrinsic laws that built them.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.600]   But the things at the boundary are just at the boundary,
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.000]   they're evolving with us.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.840]   And we'll learn more about that structure as we go along.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.120]   But really, if we wanna talk about
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.560]   what's fundamental inside our universe,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.860]   we have to talk about all these things
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.500]   that are traditionally considered emergent,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.320]   but really just structures in time
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.120]   that have causal histories that constructed them
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.600]   and are really actually what our universe is about.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.700]   - So we should focus on the construction methodology
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.880]   as the fundamental thing.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.360]   Do you think there's a bottom
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.620]   to the smallest possible thing that makes up the universe?
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.440]   - I don't see one.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.120]   - And it'll take way too long.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.080]   It'll take longer to find that
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.120]   than it will to understand the mechanism that created life.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.080]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.900]   I think for me, the frontier in modern physics,
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.200]   where the new physics lies,
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.480]   is not in high energy particle physics,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.460]   it's not in quantum gravity,
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.960]   it's not in any of these sort of traditionally sold,
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.600]   this is gonna be the newest, deepest insight
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.920]   we have into the nature of reality.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   It is going to be in studying the problems of life
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.860]   and intelligence and the things that are sort of
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   also our current existential crises as a civilization
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.220]   or a culture that's going through
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.240]   an existential trauma of inventing technologies
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.700]   that we don't understand right now.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.580]   - The existential trauma and the terror we feel
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.440]   that that technology might somehow destroy us,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.500]   us meaning living, intelligent living organisms,
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.940]   yet we don't understand what that even means.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.140]   - Well, humans have always been afraid
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.420]   of our technologies though, right?
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.900]   So it's kind of a fascinating thing
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.940]   that every time we invent something we don't understand,
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.500]   it takes us a little while to catch up with it.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.140]   - I think also in part, humans kind of love being afraid.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.660]   - Yeah, we love being traumatized.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.060]   - It's weird.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.060]   - We wanna learn more,
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.160]   and then when we learn more, it traumatizes us.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.140]   (laughing)
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.660]   You know, I never thought about this before,
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.500]   but I think this is one of the reasons I love what I do
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.540]   is because it traumatizes me all the time.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.380]   (laughing)
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.740]   That sounds really bad.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.860]   But what I mean is, I love the shock of realizing that,
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.500]   coming to understand something in a way
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.540]   that you never understood it before.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.540]   I think, it seems to me when I see a lot of the ways
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.860]   other people react to new ideas,
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.340]   that they don't feel that way intrinsically.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.020]   But for me, that's like, that's why I do what I do.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.780]   I love, I love that feeling.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.660]   - But you're also working on a topic
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.380]   where it's fundamentally ego-destroying,
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.300]   'cause you're talking about like life.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.300]   It's humbling to think that we're not,
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.180]   the individual human is not special.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.020]   - Yeah.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.260]   - And you're like very viscerally exploring that.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.940]   - Yeah, I'm trying to embody that.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.500]   'Cause I think you have to live the physics
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.380]   to understand it.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.140]   But there's a great quote about Einstein.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.220]   I don't know if this is true or not,
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.380]   that he once said that he could feel
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.780]   a light beam in his belly.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.540]   And I think, (laughing)
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.780]   but I think you gotta think about it though, right?
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.100]   If you're a really deep thinker
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.940]   and you're really thinking about reality that deeply,
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.340]   and you are part of the reality
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.580]   that you're trying to describe, you feel it.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.540]   You really feel it.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.540]   - That's what I was saying about,
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.260]   you're always like walking along the cliff.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.620]   If you fall off, you're falling into madness.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.220]   - Yes, it's a constant, constant descent into madness.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.540]   - The fascinating thing about physicists and madness
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.420]   is that you don't know if you've fallen off the cliff.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.500]   - Yeah, you know you don't know.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.780]   - That's the cool thing about that.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.580]   - I rely on other people to tell me.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.580]   Actually, this is very funny,
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.380]   'cause I have these conversations with my students often.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.660]   They're worried about going crazy.
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.500]   (laughing)
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.540]   Like, (laughing)
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.020]   reassure them that one of the reasons they'll stay sane
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.140]   is by trying to work on concrete problems.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.340]   - Going crazy or waking up, I don't know which one it is.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.460]   - Yeah.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.340]   - So what do you think is the origin of life on Earth?
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.380]   And how can we talk about it in a productive way?
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.020]   - The origin of life is like this boundary
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:47.460]   that the universe can only cross
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.860]   if a structure that emerges can reinforce its own existence,
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.260]   which is self-reproduction, autocatalysis,
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.220]   things people traditionally talk about.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   But it has to be able to maintain its own existence
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.100]   against this sort of randomness that happens in chemistry
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.460]   and this randomness that happens in the quantum world.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.260]   And it's in some sense the emergence
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.140]   of a deterministic structure that says,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.380]   I'm gonna exist and I'm gonna keep going.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.860]   But pinning that down is really hard.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.780]   We have ways of thinking about it in assembly theory
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.020]   that I think are pretty rigorous.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.700]   And one of the things I'm really excited about
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.220]   is trying to actually quantify
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.420]   in an assembly theoretic way
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.420]   when the origin of life happens.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.860]   But the basic process I have in mind
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   is like a system that has no causal contingency,
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.660]   no constraints of objects,
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.820]   basically constraining the existence of other objects
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.660]   or allowing the existence of other objects.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.300]   And so that sounds very abstract,
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.740]   but you can just think of like a chemical reaction
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.740]   can't happen if there's not a catalyst, for example,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.860]   or a baby can't be born if there wasn't a parent.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.780]   So there's a lot of causal contingency
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.500]   that's necessary for certain things to happen.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   So you think about this sort of unconstrained random system,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.580]   there's nothing that reinforces
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.900]   the existence of other things.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.340]   So the sort of resources just get washed out
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.620]   in all of these different structures
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.340]   and none of them exist again.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.260]   Or they just, they're not very complicated
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.980]   if they're in high abundance.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.820]   And some random events allow some things
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.980]   to start reinforcing the existence
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.820]   of a small subset of objects.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.700]   And if they can do that,
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.820]   like just molecules basically recognizing each other
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.180]   and being able to catalyze certain reactions,
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.740]   there's this kind of transition point that happens
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:47.740]   where unless you get a self-reinforcing structure,
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.940]   something that can maintain its own existence,
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.900]   it actually can't cross this boundary
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.180]   to make any objects in high abundance
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.780]   without having this sort of past history
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.940]   that it's carrying with us
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.220]   and maintaining the existence of that past history.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.940]   And that boundary point where objects can't exist
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.500]   unless they have the selection in history in them
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.860]   is what we call the original life.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.180]   And pretty much everything beyond that boundary
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.100]   is holding on for dear life
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.100]   to all of the causation and causal structure
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.380]   that's basically put it there.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.900]   And it's carving its way through this possibility space
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.900]   into generating more and more structure.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.620]   And that's when you get the open-ended cascade of evolution.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.540]   But that boundary point is really hard to cross.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.580]   And then what happens when you cross that boundary point
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.180]   and the way objects come into existence
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.140]   is also like really fascinating dynamics
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.020]   because as things become more complex,
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.500]   the assembly index increases,
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.620]   I can explain all these things.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.860]   Sorry, you can tell me what you wanna explain.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.000]   I mean, explain or what people will wanna hear.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.660]   Sorry, I have a very vivid visual in my brain
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.180]   and it's really hard to articulate it.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.500]   - Gotta convert it to language.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.320]   - I know, it's so hard.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.600]   It's going from a feeling to a visual to language
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.440]   is so stifling sometimes.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.660]   - And then I have to convert it
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.300]   from language to a visual, to a feeling.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.140]   - Yeah.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.180]   - I think it's working.
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.580]   - I hope so.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.580]   - I really like the self-reinforcing objects.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.340]   I mean, just so I understand,
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.900]   one way to create a lot of the same kind of object
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.500]   is make them self-reinforcing.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.260]   - Yes.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.300]   So self-reproduction has this property, right?
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.480]   Like if that system can make itself,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.820]   then it can persist in time, right?
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.620]   'Cause all objects decay, they all have a finite lifetime.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.300]   So if you're able to make a copy of yourself
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:42.260]   before you die, before the second law eats you
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.700]   or whatever people think happens,
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.380]   then that structure can persist in time.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.900]   - So that's a way to sort of emerge out of a random soup,
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.580]   out of the randomness of soup.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:55.340]   - Right, but things that can copy themselves are very rare.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.180]   - Yeah, rare.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:01.180]   - And so what ends up happening is that you get structures
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.160]   that enable the existence of other things.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.160]   And then somehow, only for some sets of objects,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.040]   you get closed structures that are self-reinforcing
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.760]   and allow that entire structure to persist.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.480]   - Right, so the one object A reinforces the existence
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.880]   of object B, but object A can die.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.720]   - Yeah.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.360]   - So you have to close that loop.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.200]   - Right.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.040]   So this is the classic idea.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.720]   - This is all very unlikely statistically,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.140]   but, you know, that's sufficiently,
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.000]   so you're saying there's a chance.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.840]   - There is a chance.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.800]   - It's still a probability, but once you solve that,
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.280]   once you close the loop, you can create
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.480]   a lot of those objects.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.760]   - And that's what we're trying to figure out
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.720]   is what are the causal constraints that close the loop.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.640]   So there is this idea that's been in the literature
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.520]   for a really long time that was originally proposed
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.960]   by Stuart Kaufman as really critical
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.560]   to the origin life called autocatalytic set.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.640]   So autocatalytic set is exactly this property.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.680]   We have A makes B, B makes C, C makes A,
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.800]   and you get a closed system.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.000]   But the problem with the theory of autocatalytic sets
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.160]   is it's incredibly brittle as a theory,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.920]   and it requires a lot of ad hoc assumptions.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.760]   Like you have to assume function.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.160]   You have to say this thing makes B.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.600]   It's not an emergent property,
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.560]   the association between A and B.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.360]   And so the way I think about it is much more general.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.840]   If you think about these histories that make objects,
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.520]   it's kind of like the structure of the histories
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:32.680]   becomes collapses in such a way
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.040]   that these things are all
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.320]   in the same sort of causal structure,
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.920]   and that causal structure actually loops back on itself
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.600]   to be able to generate some of the things
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.360]   that make the higher level structures.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.400]   Leah has a beautiful example of this, actually,
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.240]   in molybdenum.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.240]   It's like the first non-organic autocatalytic set.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.200]   It's a self-reproducing molybdenum ring,
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.280]   but it's like molybdenum.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.320]   And basically, if you look at the molybdenum,
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.960]   it makes a huge molybdenum ring.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.400]   I don't remember exactly how big it is.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.440]   It might be like 150 molybdenum atoms or something.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.240]   But if you think about the configuration space
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.480]   of that object, it's exponentially large
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.640]   how many possible molecules.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.680]   So why does the entire system collapse
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   on just making that one structure?
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.800]   If you start from molybdenum atoms
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.440]   that are maybe just a couple of them stuck together.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.960]   And so what they see in this system
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.920]   is there's a few intermediate stages.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.280]   So there's like some random events
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.440]   where the chemistry comes together
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.720]   and makes these structures.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.640]   And then once you get to this very large one,
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.320]   it becomes a template for the smaller ones.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.880]   And then the whole system just reinforces
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   its own production.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.920]   - How did Lee find this molybdenum?
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.180]   (laughing)
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:44.220]   - If I knew how Lee's brain work,
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.160]   I think I would understand a lot more about the universe.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.640]   - This is not an algorithmic discovery, it's a--
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.660]   - No, but I think it goes to the deepest roots
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.700]   of when he started thinking about origins of life.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.720]   So I mean, I don't know all his history,
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.800]   but like what he's told me
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.320]   is he started out in crystallography.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.000]   And there's some things that he would just,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.280]   like people would just take for granted
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.840]   about chemical structures
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.840]   that he was like deeply perplexed about.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.960]   Like just like why are these like really intricate,
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.120]   really complex structures forming so easily
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.840]   under these conditions?
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.960]   And he was really interested in life,
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.360]   but he started in that field.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.740]   So he's just carried with him
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.620]   these sort of deep insights from these systems
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.360]   that seem like they're totally not alive
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.960]   and just like these metallic chemistries
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.120]   into actually thinking about the deep principles of life.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   So I think he already knew a lot about that chemistry
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:45.680]   and he also, you know, assembly theory came
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.380]   from him thinking about how these systems work.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.420]   So he had some intuition about what was going on
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.400]   with this molybdenum ring.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.280]   - The molybdenum might be able to be the thing
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.640]   that makes a ring.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.080]   - They knew about them for a long time,
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.440]   but they didn't know that the mechanism
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.000]   of why that particular structure form
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.840]   was autocatalytic feedback.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.880]   And so that's what they figured out in this paper.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.200]   And I actually think that paper is revealing
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.640]   some of the mechanism of the origin of life transition.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.320]   'Cause really what you see,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.620]   like the origin of life is basically like,
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.120]   you should have a combinatorial explosion
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.900]   of the space of possible structures
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.540]   that are too large to exhaust.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.880]   And yet you see it collapse on this, you know,
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.220]   really small space of possibilities
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.140]   that's mutually reinforcing itself to keep existing.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.900]   That is the origin of life.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.860]   - There's some set of structures that result
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.540]   in this autocatalytic feedback.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.380]   - Yeah.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.660]   - And what is it, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny percent?
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.860]   - I think it's a small space.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.320]   Like chemistry is very large.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.180]   - And so like--
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.700]   - There might be a lot of them out there, but we don't know.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.060]   - And one of them is the thing
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.660]   that probably started life on Earth.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.500]   - That's right.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.860]   - Or many, many starts.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:54:59.700]   - Yes.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:00.520]   - And it keeps starting maybe.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.360]   - Yeah.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.500]   I mean, there's also all kinds of other weird properties
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:08.500]   that happen around this kind of phase boundary.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.940]   So this other project that I have in my lab
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.800]   is focused on the origin of chirality,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.280]   which is, you know, thinking about,
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.320]   so chirality is this property of molecules
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.180]   that they can come in mirror image forms.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.320]   So like just, like chirality means hand.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.820]   So your left and right hand
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.660]   are what's called non-superimposable
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.280]   because if you try to lay one on the other,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.620]   you can't actually lay them directly on top of each other.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.680]   And that's the property of being a mirror image.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.580]   So there's this sort of perplexing property
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.420]   of the chemistry of life
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.940]   that no one's been able to really adequately explain
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:44.420]   that all of the amino acids in proteins are left-handed
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:49.420]   and all of the bases in RNA and DNA are right-handed.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:54.060]   And yet the chemistry of these building block units,
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.540]   the amino acids and nucleobases
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.020]   is the same for left and right-handed.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.420]   So you have to have like some kind of symmetry breaking
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.900]   where you go from these chemistries
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.580]   that seem entirely equivalent
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:07.420]   to only having one chemistry take over as the dominant form.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.340]   And for a long time, I had been really,
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:13.300]   I actually did my PhD on the origin of chirality.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.420]   I was working on it
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.780]   as like a symmetry breaking problem in physics.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   This is how I got started on the origin of life.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:19.940]   And then I left it for a long time
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.700]   'cause I thought it was like one of the most boring problems
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.260]   in the origin of life, but I've come back to it
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.140]   'cause I think there's something really deep going on here
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.540]   related to this like combinatorial explosion
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.060]   of the space of possibilities.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.660]   But just to get to that point,
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:36.200]   like this feature of this handedness has been the main focus,
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.060]   but people take for granted
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.580]   the existence of chiral molecules at all,
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.720]   that this property of having a handedness,
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.740]   and they just assume that,
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.420]   you know, like it's just a generic feature of chemistry.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.140]   But if you actually look at molecules,
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.740]   if you look at chemical space,
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.540]   which is like the space of all possible molecules
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.060]   that people can generate,
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.100]   and you look at small molecules,
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.140]   things that have less than about seven to 11 heavy atoms,
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.780]   so things that are not hydrogen,
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.900]   almost every single molecule in that space is achiral,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.300]   like doesn't have a chiral center.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.060]   So it would be like a spoon.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.260]   A spoon doesn't have it,
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.940]   like it's the same as its mirror image.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.940]   It's not like a hand that's different than its mirror image.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.100]   But if you get to like this threshold boundary,
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.300]   above that boundary, almost every single molecule is chiral.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.640]   So you go from a universe
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.340]   where almost nothing has a mirror image form,
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.900]   there's no mirror image universe of possibilities,
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.180]   to this one where every single structure
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:37.620]   has pretty much a mirror image version.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.300]   And what we've been looking at in my lab
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.140]   is that it seems to be the case
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.900]   that the original life transition
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.260]   happens around the time when you start accumulating.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:52.940]   You push your molecules to a large enough complexity
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:57.220]   that chiral molecules become very likely to form.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.220]   And then there's a cascade of molecular recognition
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.060]   where chiral molecules can recognize each other.
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.140]   And then you get this sort of autocatalytic feedback
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.660]   and things self-reinforcing.
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.620]   - So is chirality in itself an interesting feature
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.020]   or just an accident of complexity?
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.500]   - No, it's a super interesting feature.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.980]   I think chirality breaks symmetry in time, not space.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.760]   So we think of it as a spatial property,
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.180]   like a left and right hand.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.760]   But if I choose the left hand,
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.460]   I'm basically choosing the future of that system
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.020]   for all time because I've basically made a choice
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.760]   between the ways that that molecule can now react
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.380]   with every other object in its chemical universe.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.220]   - Oh, I see.
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.620]   - And so you're actually like,
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.560]   when you have this splitting of making a molecule
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.580]   that now has another form it could have had
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.820]   by the same exact atomic composition,
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.740]   but now it's just a mirror image isometry,
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.220]   you're basically splitting the universe
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.740]   of possibilities every time.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.020]   - Yeah, in two.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.100]   - In two, but molecules can have more than one chiral center
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.580]   and that's not the only stereosometry that they can have.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.540]   So this is one of the reasons that Taxol
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.860]   fills 1.5 universes of space.
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.740]   It's all of these spatial permutations
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.860]   that you do on these objects
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.860]   that actually makes the space so huge.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.740]   So the point of this sort of chiral transition
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:10.060]   that I'm putting out is chirality is actually a signature
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.660]   of being in a complex chemical space.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.980]   And the fact that we think it's a really generic feature
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.500]   of chemistry and it's really prevalent
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.640]   is because most of the chemistry we study on earth
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.500]   is a product already of life.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.420]   And it also has to do with this transition and assembly,
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.900]   this transition and possibility spaces,
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.100]   because I think there's something really fundamental
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:30.660]   going on at this boundary
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.900]   that you don't really need to go that far
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.780]   into chemical space to actually see life
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.380]   in terms of this depth in time,
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.100]   this depth in symmetries of objects
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.940]   in terms of like chiral symmetries
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.200]   or this assembly structure.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:50.460]   But getting past this boundary
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.380]   that's not very deep in that space requires life.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:59.060]   It's a really weird property and it's really weird
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.180]   that so many abrupt things happen in chemistry
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.380]   at that same scale.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:07.380]   - So would that be the greatest invention ever made on earth
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.940]   in its evolutionary history?
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.260]   So I really like that formulation of it.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.180]   Nick Lane has a book called "Life Ascending"
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.380]   where he lists the 10 great inventions of evolution,
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.860]   the origin of life being first,
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.860]   and DNA, the hereditary material
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.340]   that encodes the genetic instructions
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.620]   for all living organisms,
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.700]   then photosynthesis, the process that allows organisms
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.860]   to convert sunlight into chemical energy,
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.220]   producing oxygen as a byproduct,
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.900]   the complex cell, eukaryotic cells,
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.620]   which contain a nucleus and organelles
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.340]   that rose from simple bacterial cells,
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.060]   sex, sexual reproduction,
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.500]   movement, so just the ability to move
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.540]   under which you have the predation,
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.340]   the predators and ability of living organisms
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.180]   to find food. - I like that movement's
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.100]   in there, that's cool.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.700]   - Yeah, but a movement includes
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.900]   a lot of interesting stuff in there,
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.460]   like predator-prey dynamic,
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:02.180]   which, not to romanticize "Nature is Metal,"
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.060]   that seems like an important one.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:08.940]   I don't know, it's such a computationally powerful thing
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.740]   to have a predator and prey.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.980]   - Well, it's efficient for things to eat
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.540]   other things that are already alive
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.740]   'cause they don't have to go all the way back
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.840]   to the base chemistry.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.260]   - Well, that, but maybe I just like deadlines,
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.940]   but it creates an urgency, you're gonna get eaten.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.900]   - You gotta live.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.100]   - Yeah, like survival,
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.700]   it's not just the static environment
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.660]   you're battling against. - Oh, I see.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:34.340]   - You're like, the dangers against which
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.660]   you're trying to survive are also evolving.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.820]   This is just a much faster way
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.780]   to explore the space of possibilities.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.900]   - I actually think it's a gift
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.340]   that we don't have much time.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.960]   - Yes, sight, the ability to see,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.860]   so the increasing complexifying of sensory organisms,
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.380]   consciousness, and death,
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.580]   the concept of programmed cell death,
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.980]   these are all inventions along the line.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.700]   - I like invention as a word for them,
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.580]   I think that's good.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.740]   - Which are the more interesting inventions to you,
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.660]   the origin of life?
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.280]   Because you kind of are not glorifying
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.900]   the origin of life itself.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.580]   There's a process. - No, I think the origin
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.700]   of life is a continual process, that's why.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.260]   I'm interested in the first transition
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.180]   in solving that problem 'cause I think it's the hardest,
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.180]   but I think it's happening all the time.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.340]   - When you look back at the history of Earth,
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.340]   like what are you impressed happened?
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:33.340]   - I like sight as an invention
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.260]   'cause I think having sensory perception
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.900]   and trying to comprehend the world,
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.420]   to use the anthropocentric terms,
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.540]   is like a really critical feature of life.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.500]   And I also, it's interesting the way
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.220]   that sight has complexified over time, right?
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.140]   So like if you think of the origin of life,
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.580]   nothing on the planet could see, right?
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.260]   So like for a long time, life had no sight.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:04.460]   And then like photon receptors were invented.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.460]   And then when multicellularity evolved,
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:12.460]   those cells eventually grew into eyes
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.500]   and we had the multicellular eye.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500]   And then it's interesting when you get to societies,
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.700]   like human societies, that we invent
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.380]   even better technologies of seeing,
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.500]   like telescopes and microscopes,
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.680]   which allow us to see deeper into the universe
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.120]   or at smaller scales.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.660]   So I think that's pretty profound,
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:35.660]   the way that sight has transformed the ability of life
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:40.920]   to literally see the reality in which it's existing in.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.140]   - I think consciousness is also
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.460]   obviously deeply interesting.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.960]   I've gotten kind of obsessed with like octopus.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.220]   They're just so weird.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.900]   And the fact that like they evolved complex nervous systems
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.020]   kind of independently is like, seems very alien.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.020]   - Yeah, there's a lot of alien like organisms.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.860]   That's another thing I saw in the jungle.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.900]   - Yeah.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.660]   - Just things that are like, oh, okay.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.660]   They make one of those, huh?
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.200]   It just feels like there's-- - Do you have any examples?
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.560]   - There's a frog that's as thin as a sheet of paper.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.760]   And I was like, what?
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.060]   And it gives birth through like pores.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.740]   - Oh, I've seen videos of that.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.020]   It's so gross when the babies come out.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.220]   Did you see that like in person,
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.740]   like the babies coming out? - Oh, no, no.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.980]   I saw the, without the--
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.820]   - Have you seen videos of that?
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.420]   It's so gross.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.540]   It's one of the grossest things I've ever seen.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:41.420]   - Well, gross is just the other side of beautiful.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.500]   It's like, oh, wow, that's possible.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.900]   - I guess if I was one of those frogs,
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.420]   I would think that was the most beautiful event
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.260]   I'd ever seen.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.660]   Although like human childbirth
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.460]   is not that beautiful either.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.340]   - Yeah, it's all a matter of perspective.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.220]   - Well, we come in the world so violently.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.780]   It's just like, it's amazing.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.980]   - I mean, the world is a violent place.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.940]   So again, it's just another side of the coin.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.780]   - You know what?
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.500]   This actually makes me think of one that's not up there,
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.860]   which I do find really incredibly amazing
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:15.860]   is the process of like the germline cell in organisms.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:23.300]   Like basically like every living thing on this planet
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.300]   at some point in its life has to go through a single cell.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.180]   And this whole issue of like development,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.180]   like the developmental program is kind of crazy.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.620]   Like how do you build you out of a single cell?
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.700]   How does a single cell know how to do that?
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.180]   Like pattern formation of a multicellular organism
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.300]   obviously like evolves with DNA,
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.980]   but there's a lot of stuff happening there
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.300]   about when cells take on certain morphologies
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.620]   and things that people don't understand,
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   like the actual shape formation mechanism.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.780]   And a lot of people study that
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.900]   and there's a lot of advances being made now in that field.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.020]   I think it's pretty shocking though
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.300]   that like how little we know about that process.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.020]   And often it's left off of people's lists.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.740]   It's just kind of interesting.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.380]   Embryogenesis is fascinating.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.940]   - Yeah, 'cause you start from just one cell.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.500]   - Yeah, and the genes in all the cells are the same, right?
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.580]   So like the differentiation has to be
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.660]   something that's like much more about like the actual
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.700]   expression of genes over time
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.660]   and like how they get switched on and off
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.060]   and also the physical environment
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.140]   of like the cell interacting with other cells.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.820]   And there's just a lot of stuff going on.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:32.740]   - Yeah, the computation, the intelligence of that process
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.300]   might be like the most important thing to understand
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.180]   and we just kind of don't really think about it.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.020]   - Right.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.180]   - We think about the final product.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.620]   - Yeah.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:44.900]   - Maybe the key to understanding the organism
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.500]   is understanding that process, not the final product.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.340]   - Probably, yes.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.300]   I think most of the things about understanding anything
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.300]   about what we are are embedded in time.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.260]   - Well, of course you would say that.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.780]   - I know, so predictable.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:01.460]   It's turning into a deterministic universe.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.180]   - It always has been, always was, like the meme.
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.660]   - Yeah, always was, but it won't be in the future.
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.620]   - Well, that's, before we talk about the future,
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.860]   let's talk about the past, the assembly theory.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.700]   - Yes.
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.180]   - Can you explain assembly theory to me?
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.380]   I listened to Lee talk about it for many hours
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.460]   and I understood nothing.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.220]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.900]   I just wanted to take another,
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.300]   you've been already talking about it,
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:28.300]   but just what from a big picture view
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:36.420]   is the assembly theory way of thinking about our world?
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.860]   Our universe?
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:43.860]   - Yeah, I think the first thing is the observation
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:49.740]   that life seems to be the only thing in the universe
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.660]   that builds complexity in the way that we see it here,
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.100]   and complexity is obviously a loaded term,
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.820]   so I'll just use assembly instead,
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.820]   'cause I think assembly is more precise.
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:05.140]   But the idea that all the things on your desk here,
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:10.140]   from your computer to the pen to us sitting here
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.980]   don't exist anywhere else in the universe
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.660]   as far as we know, they only exist on this planet,
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.820]   and it took a long evolutionary history to get to us,
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.540]   is a real feature that we should take seriously
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.940]   as one that's deeply embedded in the laws of physics
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.540]   and the structure of the universe that we live in.
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.420]   Standard physics would say that all of that complexity
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:35.420]   traces back to the infinitesimal deviations
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:37.620]   in the initial state of the universe,
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.540]   that there was some order there.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.620]   I find that deeply unsatisfactory,
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.620]   and what assembly theory says that's very different
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:51.620]   is that the universe is basically constructing itself,
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.700]   and when you get to these common tutorial spaces
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.140]   like chemistry, where the space of possibilities
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.460]   is too large to exhaust them all,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:06.620]   you can only construct things along
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.820]   historically contingent paths,
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:11.020]   like you basically have causal chains of events
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:15.100]   that happen to allow other things to come into existence,
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:20.100]   and that this is the way that complex objects get formed
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.380]   is basically unscaffolding on the past history
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.540]   of objects making more complex objects
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.220]   making more complex objects.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.780]   That idea in itself is easy to state and simple,
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.420]   but it has some really radical implications
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:36.420]   as far as what you think is the nature of the physics
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.380]   that would describe life,
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.340]   and so what assembly theory does formally
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.980]   is try to measure the boundary in the space of all things
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.500]   that chemically could exist, for example,
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.780]   like all possible molecules,
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.180]   where is the boundary above which we should say
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.020]   these things are too complex to happen
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.940]   outside of an evolutionary chain of events,
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.740]   outside of selection,
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.180]   and we formalize that with two observables,
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.900]   one of them's the copy number of the object,
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.860]   so how many of the object did you observe,
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.660]   and the second one is what's the minimal number
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.220]   of recursive steps to make it,
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:14.980]   so if you start from elementary building blocks,
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.700]   like bonds for molecules, and you put them together,
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.540]   and then you take things you've made already
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.500]   and build up to the object,
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.460]   what's the shortest number of steps you had to take,
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:28.420]   and what Lee's been able to show in the lab with his team
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   is that for organic chemistry, it's about 15 steps,
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:38.020]   and then you only see molecules that,
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.900]   you know, the only molecules that we observe
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.100]   that are past that threshold are ones that are in life,
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.620]   and in fact, one of the things I'm trying to do
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.540]   with this idea of like trying to actually quantify
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.700]   the origin of life as a transition
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.300]   in like a phase transition in assembly theory
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.860]   is actually be able to explain
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.020]   why that boundary is where it is,
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.300]   'cause I think that's actually the boundary
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.340]   that life must cross, so the idea of going back
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.740]   to this thing we were talking about before
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:06.180]   about these structures that can reinforce
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.980]   their own existence and move past that boundary,
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:12.140]   15 seems to be that boundary in chemical space.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.300]   It's not a universal number.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.380]   It will be different for different assembly spaces,
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.980]   but that's what we've experimentally validated so far,
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.820]   and then--
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.700]   - So literally 15, like the assembly index is 15?
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.620]   - It's 15 or so for the experimental data, yeah.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.980]   - So that's when you start getting the self-reinforcing.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.260]   - That's when you have to have that feature
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.820]   in order to observe molecules in high abundance
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.820]   in that space.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.020]   - So copy number is the number of exact copies.
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.580]   That's what you mean by high abundance,
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.820]   and assembly index or the complexity of the object
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:47.460]   is how many steps it took to create it, recursive?
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.220]   - Recursive, yeah.
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.220]   So you can think of objects in assembly theory
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.020]   as basically recursive stacks
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.580]   of the construction steps to build them.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.020]   So it's like you take this step,
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.100]   and then you make this object,
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.780]   and you make this object, and make this object,
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.220]   and then you get up to the final object,
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.020]   but that object is all of that history
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.900]   rolled up into the current structure.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.660]   - What if you took the long way home?
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.660]   - You can't take the long way.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.500]   - Why not?
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.900]   - The long way doesn't exist.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.300]   - That's a good song, though.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.940]   What do you mean the long way doesn't exist?
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.260]   If I do a random walk from A to B,
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.460]   I'll eventually, if I start at A,
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.980]   I'll eventually end up at B,
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.660]   and that random walk would be much shorter--
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.500]   - So it turns out--
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.340]   - Longer than the short--
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.220]   - No, if you look at objects,
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:33.380]   and so we define something we call the assembly universe,
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.620]   and the assembly universe is ordered in time.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.460]   It's actually ordered in the causation,
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.500]   the number of steps to produce an object,
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.900]   and so all objects in the universe are, in some sense,
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.580]   exist in a layer that's defined by their assembly index,
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.420]   and the size of each layer is growing exponentially.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.300]   So what you're talking about,
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:57.060]   if you wanna look at the long way of getting to an object,
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.260]   as I'm increasing the assembly index of an object,
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.540]   I'm moving deeper and deeper
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.940]   into an exponentially growing space,
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.660]   and it's actually also the case
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.140]   that the sort of typical path to get to that object
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.660]   is also exponentially growing
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.620]   with respect to the assembly index,
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.900]   and so if you want to try to make
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.220]   a more and more complex object,
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.740]   and you wanna do it by a typical path,
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:21.540]   that's actually an exponentially receding horizon,
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.660]   and so most objects that come into existence
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.180]   have to be causally very similar to the things that exist
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.580]   'cause they're close by in that space,
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.740]   and they can actually get to it
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.700]   by an almost shortest path for that object.
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.100]   - Yeah, the almost shortest path is the most likely,
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.780]   and like by a lot.
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:36.820]   - By a lot.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.540]   - Okay, so if you see a high copy number.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.380]   - Yeah, imagine yourself--
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.060]   - A copy number greater than one.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.060]   - Yeah, I mean, basically we live,
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.340]   the more complex we get,
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:50.180]   we live in a space that is growing exponentially large,
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:53.020]   and the ways of getting to objects in the space
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.180]   are also growing exponentially large,
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:00.180]   and so we're this kind of recursively stacked structure
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.460]   of all of these objects
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.340]   that are clinging onto each other for existence,
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.100]   and then they grab something else
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.420]   and are able to bring that thing into existence
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.980]   'cause it's kind of similar to them.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.620]   - But there is a phase transition.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.460]   There is a--
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.300]   - There is a transition.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.900]   - There is a place where you would say,
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.500]   oh, that's life. - I think it's actually abrupt.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.980]   I've never been able to say that in my entire career before.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.020]   I've always gone back and forth
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.180]   about whether the original life
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.300]   was kind of gradual or abrupt.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.220]   I think it's very abrupt.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.940]   - Poetically, chemically, literally, what snaps?
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.820]   Okay, that's very beautiful. - It snaps.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.340]   - Okay, but-- - We'll be poetic today,
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:35.740]   but no, I think there's like a lot of random exploration,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.980]   and then the possibility space
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:42.340]   just collapses on the structure kind of really fast.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.980]   That can reinforce its own existence
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.100]   because it's basically fighting against nonexistence.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.620]   - Yeah, you tweeted,
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.420]   "The most significant struggle for existence
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.720]   "in the evolutionary process
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.380]   "is not among the objects that do exist,
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.500]   "but between the ones that do
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.180]   "and those that never have the chance to."
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.760]   This is where selection does most of its causal work.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:10.860]   The objects that never get a chance to exist,
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.620]   the struggle between the ones that never get a chance
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.500]   to exist and the ones that, okay, what's that line exactly?
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.380]   - I don't know, we can make songs out of all of these.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.740]   - What are the objects that never get a chance to exist?
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.580]   What does that mean?
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.140]   - So there was this website, I forgot what it was,
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.660]   but it's like a neural network
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.540]   that just generates a human face,
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.020]   and it's like this person does not exist.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.140]   I think that's what it's called, right?
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.480]   So you can just click on that all day,
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.140]   and you can look at people all day that don't exist.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.380]   All of those people exist
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.420]   in that space of things that don't exist.
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:44.340]   - Yeah, but there's the real struggle.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.540]   - Yeah, so the struggle of the quote,
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.660]   the struggle for existence is,
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.380]   that goes all the way back to Darwin's writing
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.720]   about natural selection, right?
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.740]   So the whole idea of survival of the fittest
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.140]   is everything struggling to exist,
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.020]   this predator-prey dynamic.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.620]   And the fittest survive,
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.060]   and so the struggle for existence
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.040]   is really what selection is all about.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.540]   And that's true.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.740]   We do see things that do exist
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.900]   competing to continue to exist.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.860]   But each time that,
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.700]   like if you think about this space of possibilities,
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:23.420]   and each time the universe generates a new structure,
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.500]   or like an object that exists
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.620]   generates a new structure along this causal chain,
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.820]   it's generating something that exists
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.540]   that never existed before.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.620]   And each time that we make that kind of decision,
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.260]   we're excluding a huge space of possibilities.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.220]   And so actually like as this process
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.160]   of increasing assembly index,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.060]   it's not just that like the space
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.000]   that these objects exist in is exponentially growing,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.940]   but there are objects in that space
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.980]   that are exponentially receding away from us.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:56.900]   So they're becoming exponentially less
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.140]   and less likely to ever exist.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:03.540]   And so existence excludes a huge number of things.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.180]   - Just because of the accident of history,
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.300]   how it ended up--
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.620]   - Yeah, it is in part an accident,
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.860]   because I think some of the structure that gets generated
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.940]   is driven a bit by randomness.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.260]   I think a lot of it,
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.420]   so one of the conceptions that we have in assembly theory
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.500]   is the universe is random at its base.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.660]   You can see this in chemistry,
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.460]   like unconstrained chemical reactions are pretty random.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.220]   And then, and also quantum mechanics,
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.260]   there's lots of places that give evidence for that.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.380]   And deterministic structures emerge
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.140]   by things that can causally reinforce themselves
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.820]   and maintain persistence over time.
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.540]   And so we are some of the most deterministic things
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:48.380]   in the universe.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.700]   And so like we can generate very regular structure
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.740]   and we can generate new structure
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.640]   along a particular lineage,
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.260]   but the possibility space at the sort of tips,
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:01.200]   like the things we can generate next is really huge.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.380]   So there's some stochasticity in what we actually,
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.460]   you know, instantiate as like the next structures
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.460]   that get built in the biosphere.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.420]   It's not completely deterministic,
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.100]   'cause the space of future possibilities
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.780]   is always larger than the space of things that exist now.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.660]   - So how many instantiations of life is out there,
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.480]   do you think?
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:26.660]   So how often does this happen?
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.820]   What we see happen here on Earth,
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.760]   how often is this process repeated
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.960]   throughout our galaxy, throughout the universe?
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.040]   - So I said before, like right now,
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.560]   I think the origin of life is a continuous process on Earth.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.840]   Like I think this idea of like combinatorial spaces
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.960]   that our biosphere generates, not just chemistry,
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.680]   but other spaces, often cross this threshold
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.800]   where they then allow themselves to persist
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.500]   with particular regular structure over time.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.820]   So language is another one where, you know,
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:57.680]   like the space of, you know, possible configurations
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.820]   of the 26 letters of the English alphabet
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.320]   is astronomically large,
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.080]   but we use with very high regularity certain structures.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.520]   And then we associate meaning to them
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.000]   because of the regularity of like how much we use them,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.660]   right, so meaning is an emergent property
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.420]   of the causation and the objects
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.840]   and like how often they recur
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.080]   and what the relationship of the recurrence is
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.220]   to other objects.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.360]   - Meaning is the emergent property, okay, got it.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.320]   - Well, this is why you can play
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.080]   with language so much, actually.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.640]   So words don't really carry meaning,
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.320]   it's just about how you lace them together.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.200]   - Yeah, but from where does the--
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.240]   - But you don't have a lot of room.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.440]   Obviously, as a speaker of a given language,
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.760]   you don't have a lot of room with a given word to wiggle,
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.000]   but you do have a certain amount of room
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.300]   to push the meanings of words.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.440]   And I do this all the time and you have to do it
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.160]   with the kind of work that I do
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.160]   because if you want to discover an abstraction,
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.960]   like some kind of concept that we don't understand yet,
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.920]   it means we don't have the language.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.920]   And so the words that we have are inadequate
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.840]   to describe the things.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.040]   This is why we're having a hard time talking
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:04.880]   about assembly theory
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.040]   'cause it's a newly emerging idea.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.280]   And so I'm constantly playing with words in different ways
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.720]   to try to convey the meaning
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.200]   that is actually behind the words, but it's hard to do.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.320]   - So you have to wiggle within the constraints.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.920]   - Yes, lots of wiggle.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.440]   - The great orators are just good at wiggling.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.260]   Do you wiggle?
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:32.280]   - I'm not a very good wiggler, no.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.360]   This is the problem.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.560]   This is part of the problem.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.160]   - No, I like playing with words a lot.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.080]   You know, it's very funny
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.640]   'cause I know you talked about this with Lee,
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.600]   but people are so offended by the writing of the paper
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.280]   that came out last fall.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.680]   And it was interesting because the ways that we use words
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.080]   were not the way that people were interacting with the words.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.200]   And I think that was part of the mismatch
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.400]   where we were trying to use words in a new way
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.480]   'cause we were trying to describe something
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.360]   that hadn't been described adequately before,
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.560]   but we had to use the words that everyone else uses
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.160]   for things that are related.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.360]   And so it was really interesting to watch that clash play out
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.840]   in real time for me,
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.120]   being someone that tries to be so precise with my word usage,
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.080]   knowing that it's always gonna be vague.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.480]   - Boy, can I relate.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.920]   What is truth?
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.760]   Is truth the thing you meant when you wrote the words
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.440]   or is truth the thing that people understood
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.640]   when they read the words?
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.480]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.200]   - I think that compression mechanism into language
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.200]   is a really interesting one
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.200]   and that's why Twitter is a nice exercise.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.240]   - I love Twitter.
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.080]   - You get to write a thing
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.880]   and you think a certain thing when you write it.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.360]   And then you get to see all these other people interpret it
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.760]   in all kinds of different ways.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.680]   - I use it as an experimental platform for that reason.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.840]   - I wish there was a higher diversity
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.000]   of interpretation mechanisms applied to tweets,
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.680]   meaning like all kinds of different people would come to it.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.200]   Like some people that see the good in everything
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.320]   and some people that are ultra cynical,
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.680]   a bunch of haters and a bunch of lovers and a bunch of-
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.880]   - Maybe they could do better jobs
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.120]   with presenting material to people.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.520]   It's usually based on interest,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.600]   but I think it would be really nice
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.040]   if you got like 10% of your Twitter feed
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.560]   was random stuff sampled from other places.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.160]   That'd be kind of fun.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.040]   - I also would love to filter,
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.480]   just like bin the response to tweets
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.880]   by like the people that hate on everything.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.720]   - Yes.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:34.560]   - The people that are-
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.640]   - Oh, that would be fantastic.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.400]   - The people that are like super positive on everything.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.880]   And then they'll just kind of,
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.000]   I guess, normalize the response.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.400]   'Cause then it'd be cool to see
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.440]   if the people that are usually positive about everything
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   are hating on you or like totally don't understand
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.040]   or completely misunderstood.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.440]   - Yeah, usually it takes a lot of clicking to find that out.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.280]   - Yeah.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.520]   - Yeah, so it'd be better if it was sorted, yeah.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.960]   - The more clicking you do,
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:01.200]   the more damaging it is to the soul.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.040]   - Yeah.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:02.860]   It's like, instead of like,
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.700]   like you could have the blue check,
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.540]   but you should have like,
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.480]   are you a pessimist, an optimist?
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.300]   - Yeah, there's a lot of colors.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.140]   - Chaotic neutral?
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:13.180]   - Yeah, a whole rainbow of checks.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.520]   And then you realize there's more categories
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.400]   than we can possibly express in colors.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.680]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.960]   People are complex.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.800]   - That's our best feature.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.160]   I don't know how we got to the wiggling required,
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.560]   given the constraints of language,
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.320]   because I think we started about me asking about alien life,
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:41.600]   which is how many different times
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.920]   did the face transition happen elsewhere?
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.920]   Do you think there's other alien civilizations out there?
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.600]   This goes into like the,
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.240]   are you on the boundary of insane or not?
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.600]   But when you think about the structure
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.980]   of the physics of what we are that deeply,
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.800]   it really changes your conception of things.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.800]   And going to this idea of the universe
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.240]   being kind of small in physical space
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.760]   compared to how big it is in time and like how large we are,
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.280]   it really makes me question
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.240]   about whether there's any other structure
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.560]   that's like this giant crystal in time,
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.000]   this giant causal structure,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.800]   like our biosphere/technosphere
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.740]   is anywhere else in the universe.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.660]   - Why not?
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.800]   - I don't know.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.600]   - Just because this one is gigantic
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.360]   doesn't mean there's other gigantic ones.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.920]   - But I think the universe is expanding, right?
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.040]   It's expanding in space,
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.640]   but in assembly theory, it's also expanding in time.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.240]   And actually that's driving the expansion in space.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.360]   And the expansion in time is also driving the expansion
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.920]   in the sort of combinatorial space of things on our planet.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.000]   So that's driving the sort of pace of technology
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.880]   and all the other things.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.080]   So time is driving all of these things,
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.720]   which is a little bit crazy to think
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.240]   that the universe is just getting bigger
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.980]   because time is getting bigger.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:10.400]   But like the sort of visual that gets built in my brain
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.500]   about that is like the structure
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:13.780]   that we're building on this planet
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.400]   is packing more and more time
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.840]   in this very small volume of space, right?
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.080]   'Cause our planet hasn't changed its physical size
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.000]   in four billion years,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   but there's like a ton of causation and recursion and time,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   whatever word you wanna use, information packed into this.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.680]   And I think this is also embedded
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.200]   in sort of the virtualization of our technologies
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.160]   or the abstraction of language and all of these things.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.640]   These things that seem really abstract
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.180]   are just really deep in time.
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:49.420]   And so what that looks like
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.700]   is you have a planet that becomes increasingly virtualized.
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.720]   And so it's getting bigger and bigger in time,
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.340]   but not really expanding out in space.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.860]   And the rest of space is like kind of moving away from it.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.380]   Again, it's a sort of exponentially receding horizon.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.340]   And I'm just not sure how far
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.740]   into this evolutionary process something gets
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:08.680]   if it can ever see
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.900]   that there's another such structure out there.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.540]   - What do you mean by virtualized in that context?
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.520]   - Virtual as sort of a play on virtual reality
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.440]   and like simulation theories,
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.680]   but virtual also in a sense of,
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.740]   we talk about virtual particles and particle physics,
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.080]   which they are very critical to doing calculations
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.960]   about predicting the properties of real particles,
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.000]   but we don't observe them directly.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   So what I mean by virtual here is virtual reality for me,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.480]   things that appear virtual, appear abstract
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.500]   are just things that are very deep in time
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.120]   in the structure of the things that we are.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.380]   So if you think about you as a 4 billion year old object,
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.740]   the things that are part of you,
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.740]   like your capacity to use language or think abstractly
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:01.420]   or have mathematics are just very deep temporal structures.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:05.140]   That's why they look like they're informational and abstract
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.660]   is because they're existing in this temporal part of you,
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.180]   but not necessarily spatial part.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.060]   - Just because I have a 4 billion year old history,
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.100]   why does that mean I can't hang out with aliens?
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.880]   - There's a couple of ideas that are embedded here.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.380]   So one of them comes again from Paul.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:24.340]   He wrote this book years ago about the eerie silence
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.260]   and why we're alone.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:27.300]   And he concluded the book with this idea
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.660]   of quintelligence or something,
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:32.380]   but this idea that really advanced intelligence
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.220]   would basically just build itself into a quantum computer
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.020]   and it wouldn't wanna operate in the vacuum of space
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.060]   'cause that's the best place to do quantum computation.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.740]   It would just run out all of its computations indefinitely,
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.100]   but it would look completely dark to the rest of the universe
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.220]   and I don't think as typical,
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.220]   I don't think that's actually the right physics,
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.820]   but I think something about that idea
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.020]   as I do with all ideas is partially correct.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.780]   And Freeman Dyson also had this amazing paper
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.900]   about how long life could persist in a universe
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.780]   that was exponentially expanding.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.620]   And his conception was if you imagine analog life form,
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.980]   it could run slower and slower and slower
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:12.140]   and slower and slower as a function of time.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:15.260]   And so it would be able to run indefinitely
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.980]   even against an exponentially expanding universe
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.340]   because it would just run exponentially slower.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:23.620]   And so I guess part of what I'm doing in my brain
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.340]   is putting those two things together
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.960]   along with this idea that we are building,
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.220]   like if you imagine with our technology,
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.420]   we're now building virtual realities, right?
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:37.140]   Like things we actually call virtual reality,
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.060]   which required 4 billion years of history
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.380]   and a whole bunch of data to basically embed them
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.380]   in a computer architecture.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.860]   So now you can put like an Oculus headset on
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.740]   and think that you're in this world, right?
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.020]   And what you really are embedded in
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.460]   is in a very deep temporal structure.
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.080]   And so it's huge in time, but it's very small in space.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.340]   And you can go lots of places in the virtual space, right?
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.620]   But you're still stuck in like your physical body
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.220]   and like sitting in the chair.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:06.200]   And so part of it is it might be the case
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.900]   that sufficiently evolved biospheres
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:13.420]   kind of virtualize themselves
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.020]   and they internalize their universe
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.420]   in their sort of temporal causal structure
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.860]   and they close themselves off from the rest of the universe.
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.900]   - I just don't know if a deep temporal structure
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.540]   necessarily means that you're closed off.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.380]   - No, I don't either.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.700]   So that's kind of my fear.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.940]   So I'm not sure I'm agreeing with what I say.
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.340]   I'm just saying like, this is one sort of conclusion.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.380]   And you know, like in my most sort of like,
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.980]   it's interesting 'cause I don't do psychedelic drugs.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.020]   But when people describe to me
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.500]   like your thing with the faces and stuff,
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.660]   and like I have had a lot of deep conversations
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.540]   with friends that have done psychedelic drugs
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:47.060]   for intellectual reasons and otherwise.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.040]   But I'm always like,
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.180]   oh, it sounds like you're just doing theoretical physics.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:52.680]   Like that's what brains do on theoretical physics.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.460]   So I live in these like really abstract spaces
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:57.940]   most of the time.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:01.140]   But there's also this issue of extinction, right?
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.020]   Like extinction events are basically
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:05.620]   pinching off an entire like causal structure,
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:06.660]   the one of these, like,
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.940]   I'm gonna call them time crystals.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:08.780]   I don't like know what,
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.920]   but there's like these very large objects in time,
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.300]   pinching off that whole structure from the rest of it.
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:14.180]   And so it's like,
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.700]   if you imagine that sort of same thing in the universe,
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.060]   I, you know, I once thought
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.900]   that sufficiently advanced technologies
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.060]   would look like black holes.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.780]   - They would be just completely imperceptible to us.
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:24.620]   - Yeah.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.000]   So there might be lots of aliens out there.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.460]   Maybe that's the explanation for all the singularities.
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:31.960]   They're all pinched off causal structures
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.340]   that virtualize their reality and kind of broke off from us.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.100]   - Black holes in every way.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:41.100]   So like untouchable to us or unlikely to be detectable by us.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.420]   - Right.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.140]   - With whatever sensory mechanisms we have.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:45.980]   - Yeah.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.860]   But the other way I think about it is,
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:51.260]   there is probably hopefully life out there.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.300]   So like I do work on life detection efforts
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.320]   in the solar system,
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.160]   and I'm trying to help
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.260]   with the Habitable Worlds Observatory
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.860]   mission planning right now,
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.360]   and working with like the biosignatures team for that,
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.240]   like to think about exoplanet biosignatures.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.520]   So like I have some optimism that we might find things,
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.680]   but they're the challenges
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.880]   that we don't know the likelihood for life,
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.600]   like which is what you were talking about.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.560]   So if I get to a more grounded discussion,
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:21.280]   what I'm really interested in doing
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.360]   is trying to solve the origin of life
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.340]   so we can understand how likely life is out there.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.600]   So I don't think that the,
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.240]   I think that the problem of discovering alien life
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.020]   and solving the origin of life are deeply coupled,
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.160]   and in fact are one in the same problem.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.400]   And that the first contact with alien life
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.280]   will actually be in an original life experiment.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.440]   But that part I'm super interested in.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.980]   And then there's this other feature
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:48.200]   that I think about a lot,
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:52.520]   which is our own technological phase of development
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.500]   as sort of like,
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.000]   what is this phase in the evolution of life on a planet?
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.680]   If you think about a biosphere emerging on a planet
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.400]   and evolving over billions of years
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.320]   and evolving into a technosphere.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:09.200]   When a technosphere can move off planet
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.680]   and basically reproduce itself on another planet,
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.040]   now you have biospheres reproducing themselves.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.880]   Basically, they have to go through technology to do that.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:23.160]   And so there are ways of thinking about
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.600]   sort of the nature of intelligent life
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.480]   and how it spreads in that capacity
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.240]   that I'm also really excited about and thinking about.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.960]   And all of those things for me are connected.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.280]   We have to solve the origin of life
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.640]   in order for us to get off planet
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.400]   because we basically have to start life on another planet.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.960]   And we also have to solve the origin of life
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.240]   in order to recognize other alien intelligence.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.920]   All of these things are literally the same problem.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.600]   - Right, understanding the origin of life here on Earth
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.440]   is a way to understand ourselves
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.600]   and to understanding ourselves as a prerequisite
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   for being able to detect other intelligent civilizations.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:04.960]   I, for one, take it for what it's worth, on ayahuasca,
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.840]   one of the things I did is zoom out,
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.320]   like aggressively, like a spaceship.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.200]   And it would always go quickly to the galaxy
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:19.200]   and from the galaxy to this representation of the universe.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.600]   And at least for me, from that perspective,
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.000]   it seemed like it was full of alien life.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.960]   Not just alien life, but intelligent life.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.800]   - I like that.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.440]   - And conscious life.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:34.880]   So I don't know how to convert it into words.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.880]   It's more like a feeling, like you were saying.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:40.560]   A feeling converted to a visual, converted to words.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.720]   So I had a visual with it, but really it was a feeling
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.600]   that it was just full of this vibrant energy
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.160]   that I was feeling when I'm looking
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.980]   at the people in my life and full of gratitude.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.920]   But that same exact thing is everywhere in the universe.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.280]   - Right.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.440]   I totally agree with this.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.280]   Like that visual, I really love.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.680]   And I think we live in a universe
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.280]   that generates life and purpose.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.460]   And it's part of the structure of just the world.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:19.280]   And so maybe this sort of lonely view I have is,
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.120]   I never thought about it this way
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:20.960]   'til you were describing that.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.000]   I was like, I wanna live in that universe.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.480]   And I'm a very optimistic person,
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.200]   and I love building visions of reality that are positive.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.760]   But I think for me right now in the intellectual process,
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.600]   I have to tunnel through this particular way
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.440]   of thinking about the loneliness
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.160]   of being separated in time from everything else.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.880]   Which I think we also all are,
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.640]   because time is what defines us as individuals.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.000]   - So part of you is drawn to the trauma of being alone.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   - Yeah. - Deeper in the physics.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.040]   - Yeah, but also part of what I mean
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.280]   is you have to go through ideas
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.760]   you don't necessarily agree with
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.320]   to work out what you're trying to understand.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.400]   And I'm trying to be inside this structure
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.840]   so I can really understand it.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.800]   And I don't think I've been able to,
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.720]   I'm so deeply embedded in what we are
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.600]   intellectually right now that I don't have an ability
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.140]   to see these other ones that you're describing,
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:14.980]   if they're there.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.600]   - Well, one of the things you kind of described
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.920]   that you already spoke to,
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.340]   you call it the great perceptual filter.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.180]   - Yeah.
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:23.200]   - So there's the famous great filter,
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.400]   which is basically the idea that
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.540]   there's some really powerful moment
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:33.560]   in every intelligent civilization
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.080]   where they destroy themselves.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.000]   - Yeah.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.600]   - That explains why we have not seen aliens.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.280]   And you're saying that there's something like that
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.760]   in the temporal history of the creation of complex objects
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.880]   that at a certain point, they become an island,
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.720]   an island too far to reach based on the perceptions.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:55.480]   - I hope not, but yeah, I worry about it, yeah.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.720]   - But that's basically meaning
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.880]   there's something fundamental about the universe
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.320]   where if the more complex you become,
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.840]   the harder it will be to perceive other complex.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.680]   - Yeah.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.640]   I mean, just think about us with microbial life, right?
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.800]   Like we used to once be cells.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.360]   And for most of human history,
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.040]   we didn't even recognize cellular life was there
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.800]   until we built a new technology,
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.840]   microscopes that allowed us to see them, right?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.280]   So that's kind of, it's kind of weird, right?
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.520]   Like, like things that-
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.360]   - And they're close to us.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.400]   - They're close, they're everywhere.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.520]   - But also in the history of the development
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.320]   of complex objects, they're pretty close.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.160]   - Yeah, super close, super close.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:34.800]   Like, yeah, I mean, everything on this planet is like,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.640]   it's like pretty much the same thing.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:40.520]   Like, like the space of possibilities is so huge.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.480]   It's like, we're virtually identical.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.000]   So how many flavors or kinds of life
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.640]   do you think are possible?
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.000]   - I'm kind of like trying to imagine
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.680]   all the little flickering lights in the universe,
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.120]   like in the way that you were describing it,
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:52.960]   that was kind of cool.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.640]   - It was so, I mean, it was awesome to me.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.160]   It was exactly that, it was like lights.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.000]   - Yeah.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.320]   - The way you maybe see a city,
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.360]   but a city from like up above,
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.200]   you see a city with the flickering lights,
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.200]   but there's a coldness to the city.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.040]   - Yeah.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.480]   - There's some, you know, that, you know,
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:11.040]   humans are capable of good and evil,
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.280]   and you could see like, there's a complex feeling
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.120]   to the city.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.840]   I had no such complex feeling about seeing the lights
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.360]   of all the galaxies, whatever, the billions of galaxies.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.200]   - Yeah, this is kind of cool.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.160]   I'll answer the question in a second,
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.520]   but I just maybe like this idea of flickering lights
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:29.600]   and intelligence is interesting to me because I, you know,
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.920]   like we have such a human centric view
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.960]   of alien intelligences that a lot of the work
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   that I've been doing with my lab
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.400]   is just trying to take inspiration
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.000]   from non-human life on earth.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.480]   And so I have this really talented undergrad student
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.340]   that's basically building a model of alien communication
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.960]   based on fireflies.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.560]   So one of my colleagues or at Peleg is,
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.720]   she's totally brilliant,
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.000]   but she goes out with like GoPro cameras
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.920]   and like, you know, films in high resolution,
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.920]   all these firefly flickering.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:02.880]   And she has like this theory about how their signaling
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.400]   evolved to like maximally differentiate
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.080]   the flickering patterns.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.120]   So like she has a theory basically that predicts,
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.640]   you know, like this species should flash like this.
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.720]   If this one's flashing like this,
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.560]   this other one's gonna do it at a slower rate
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.800]   so that the, you know, like they can distinguish
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.000]   each other living in the same environment.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.760]   And so this undergrads building this model
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.760]   where you have like a pulsar background
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.160]   of all these like giant flashing sources in the universe
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.960]   and an alien intelligence, you know,
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.280]   wants to signal it's there.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.980]   So it's flashing like a firefly.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:34.880]   And I just like, I like the idea of thinking
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.720]   about a non-human alien.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.760]   So that was really fun.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.960]   - The mechanism of the flashing, unfortunately,
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.400]   is like the diversity of that is very high
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.640]   and we might not be able to see it.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:44.480]   That's what--
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.800]   - Yeah, well, I think there's some ways
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.520]   we might be able to differentiate that signal.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.960]   I'm still thinking about this part of it.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.000]   So one is like if you have pulsars
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.840]   and they all have a certain spectrum
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.480]   to their pulsing patterns,
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.600]   and you have this one signal that's in there
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.160]   that's basically tried to maximally differentiate itself
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:02.160]   from all the other sources in the universe,
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.800]   it might stick out in the distribution.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.520]   Like there might be ways of actually being able to tell
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.080]   if it's an anomalous pulsar, basically.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.720]   But I don't know if that would really work or not.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.600]   So still thinking about it.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.840]   - You tweeted, "If one wants to understand
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.720]   "how truly combinatorially and compositionally complex
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.720]   "our universe is, they only need a step
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.520]   "into the world of fashion."
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.360]   - Yeah.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.560]   - It's bonkers how big the constructible space
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.560]   of human aesthetics is.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.480]   Can you explain?
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.060]   Can we explore the space of human aesthetics?
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.920]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.280]   I've been kind of obsessed with,
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.360]   I never know how to pronounce it, a chaparelli.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.760]   You know, like they have ears and things.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.280]   Like it's such like a weird, grotesque aesthetic.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:48.680]   But like it's totally bizarre.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.200]   But what I meant, like I have a visceral experience
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.640]   when I walk into my closet.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.040]   I have like a lot of (laughs)
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.160]   - How big is your closet?
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.180]   - It's pretty big.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.200]   It's like I do assembly theory every morning
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.160]   when I walk in my closet,
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.600]   because I really like a very large,
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.080]   combinatorial, diverse palette,
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.200]   but I never know what I'm gonna build in the morning.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.520]   - Do you get rid of stuff?
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.840]   - Sometimes.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.640]   - Or do you have trouble getting rid of stuff?
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.240]   - I have trouble getting rid of some stuff.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.280]   It depends on what it is.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.520]   If it's vintage, it's hard to get rid of,
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.420]   'cause it's kind of hard to replace.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:22.160]   It depends on the piece, yeah.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.160]   - So you have, your closet is one of those
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.840]   temporal time crystals that--
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:27.680]   - Yeah.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.920]   - That just, you get to visualize the entire history.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.760]   - It's a physical manifestation of my personality.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.600]   - Right.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.360]   So why is that a good visualization
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:42.360]   of the combinatorial and compositionally complex universe?
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.480]   - I think it's an interesting feature of our species
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.560]   that we allow, we get to express ourselves
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:48.880]   through what we wear.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.160]   Right, like if you think about all those animals
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.320]   in the jungle you saw,
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.360]   like they're born looking the way they look,
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.800]   and then they're stuck with it for life.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.640]   - That's true.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.480]   I mean, it is one of the loudest, clearest,
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.720]   most consistent ways we signal to each other.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.540]   - Yeah.
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:03.380]   - It's the clothing we wear.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:04.720]   - Yeah.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.040]   And it's highly dynamic.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.920]   I mean, you can be dynamic if you want to.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.200]   Very few people are, there's a certain bravery,
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.200]   but it's actually more about confidence,
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:19.080]   willing to play with style and play with aesthetics.
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.080]   And I think it's interesting
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.280]   when you start experimenting with it,
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.200]   how it changes the fluidity of the social spaces
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.720]   and the way that you interact with them.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:28.920]   - But there's also commitment.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.700]   Like, you have to wear that outfit all day.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:34.520]   - I know, I know, it's a big commitment.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.840]   Do you feel like that every morning?
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.800]   (laughing)
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.640]   - I wear it, that's why.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.140]   - You're like, this is a life commitment.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.840]   (laughing)
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.880]   - All I have is suits and a black shirt and jeans.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.120]   Those are the two outfits.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:45.960]   - Yeah.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.240]   Well, see, this is the thing though, right?
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.400]   It simplifies your thought process in the morning.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:50.840]   So like, I have other ways I do that.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.160]   I park in the same exact parking spot
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.360]   when I go to work on the fourth floor of a parking garage
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.880]   because no one ever parks on the fourth floor.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:59.960]   So I don't have to remember where I park my car.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.120]   But I really like aesthetics and playing with them.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.720]   So I'm willing to spend part of my cognitive energy
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.880]   every morning trying to figure out
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.160]   what I want to be that day.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.720]   - Did you deliberately think about
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.840]   the outfit you're wearing today?
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.880]   - Yep.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.080]   - Was there backup options?
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.360]   Were you going back and forth between some--
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.200]   - Three or four.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.960]   But I really like the look.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.240]   - Were they drastically different?
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.080]   - Yes.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.520]   (laughing)
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.360]   - It's okay.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.060]   - And even this one could have been really different
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.960]   because it's not just the sort of jacket and the shoes
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.860]   and the hairstyle.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.640]   It's like the jewelry and the accessories.
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:37.640]   So any outfit is a lot of small decisions.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.200]   - Well, I think your current outfit
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.120]   is like a lot of shades of yellow.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:43.760]   There's like a theme.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.600]   - Yeah.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.440]   - It's nice.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.760]   It's really, I'm grateful that you did that.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:48.600]   - Thanks.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.920]   - It's on art form.
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.000]   - Yeah, yellow's my daughter's favorite color.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.700]   And I never really thought about yellow much,
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:54.980]   but she's been obsessed with yellow.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:56.280]   She's seven now.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.120]   And I don't know.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.200]   I just really love it.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.320]   - I guess you can pick a color
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.800]   and just make that the constraint.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:02.640]   - Yeah.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.480]   - And just go with it.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:04.600]   - I'm playing with yellow a lot lately.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.960]   Like this is not even the most yellow
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:06.960]   'cause I black pants on,
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:10.280]   but I have worn outfits
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.280]   that have probably five shades of yellow in them.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.120]   - Wow.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.560]   (laughing)
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:17.560]   What do you think beauty is?
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.160]   We seem to, so underlying this idea
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.180]   of playing with aesthetics
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.480]   is we find certain things beautiful.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.320]   - Yeah.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.120]   - That humans find beautiful.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.080]   And why do we need to find things beautiful?
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.200]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.720]   It's not, I'm not, I mean,
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.000]   I am attracted to style and aesthetics
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.120]   because I think they're beautiful,
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.680]   but it's much more because I think it's fun to play with.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:47.580]   And so I will get to the beauty thing,
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.080]   but I guess I wanna just explain a little bit
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.480]   about my motivation in this space
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.840]   'cause it's really an intellectual thing for me.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.800]   And Stuart Brand has this great infographic
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.040]   about the layers of human society.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.560]   And I think it starts with the natural sciences
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:04.840]   and physics at the bottom,
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.920]   and it goes through all these layers and it's economics.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.360]   And then fashion is at the top,
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.480]   is the fastest moving part of human culture.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.840]   And I think I really like that
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.560]   because it's so dynamic and so short
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.200]   and it's temporal longevity
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.840]   contrasted with studying the laws of physics,
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.320]   which are like the deep structure reality
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.560]   that I feel like bridging those scales
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.320]   tells me much more about the structure
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.160]   of the world that I live in.
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.720]   - That said, there's some kinds of fashions,
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.360]   like a dude in a black suit with a black tie
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.760]   seems to be less dynamic.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.580]   - Yeah.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.240]   - It seems to persist through time.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.720]   - Are you embodying this?
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.760]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.720]   I think, I think it's just-
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.880]   - I'd like to see you wearing yellow, Lex.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.000]   - I don't, I wouldn't even know what to do with myself.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.440]   I would freak out.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.280]   I wouldn't know how to act in the world.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:58.280]   - You wouldn't know how to be you, yeah.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:59.880]   I know this is amazing though, isn't it?
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:02.120]   Amazing, like you have the choice to do it.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.920]   But one of my favorite, just on the question of beauty,
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.320]   one of my favorite fashion designers of all time
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.920]   is Alexander McQueen.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.160]   And he was really phenomenal, but like his early,
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.720]   and actually I kind of used,
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.440]   like what happened to him in the fashion industry
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.920]   as a coping mechanism with our paper
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:22.000]   when like the nature paper in the fall
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.640]   when everyone was saying it was controversial
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.400]   and how terrible that like, you know,
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.520]   but controversial is good, right?
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.520]   But like when Alexander McQueen, you know,
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.080]   first came out with his fashion lines,
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.440]   he was mixing horror and beauty.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.200]   And people were horrified.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.640]   It was so controversial.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.560]   Like they, like it was macabre.
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.240]   He had like, you know, like it looked like
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.000]   there were blood on the models and like-
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:42.840]   - It was beautiful.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.040]   We're just looking at some pictures here.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.000]   - Yeah, no, I mean, his stuff is amazing.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.480]   His first like runway line I think was called Neilism.
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.080]   I don't know if you could find it.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.840]   You know, I mean, he was really dramatic.
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.680]   He carried a lot of trauma with him.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.040]   There you go, that's, yeah.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.560]   Yeah. - Wow.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.240]   - But he changed the fashion industry.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.720]   His stuff became very popular.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.600]   - That's a good outfit to show up to a party.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.960]   - Right, right.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.280]   But this gets at the question,
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.920]   like is that horrific or is it beautiful?
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.720]   And I think, you know, he had a traumatic,
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.680]   he ended up committing suicide
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.680]   and actually he left his death note on the descent of man.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.400]   So he was a really deep person.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.800]   - So I mean, great fashion certainly
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.200]   has that kind of depth to it.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:33.640]   - Yeah, it sure does.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.880]   So I think it's the intellectual pursuit, right?
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.760]   Like it's not, so this is like very highly intellectual.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.600]   And I think it's a lot like how I play with language
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.200]   is the same way that I play with fashion
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.760]   or the same way that I play with ideas
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.680]   in theoretical physics.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.440]   Like there's always this space
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.840]   that you can just push things just enough.
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.880]   So they're like, they look like something
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:54.520]   someone thinks is familiar, but they're not familiar.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.520]   And yeah, and I think that's really cool.
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:01.680]   - It seems like beauty doesn't have much function, right?
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.680]   But it seems to also have a lot of influence
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:09.760]   on the way we collaborate with each other.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.600]   - It has tons of function.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:11.440]   What do you mean it doesn't have function?
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.600]   - I guess sexual selection incorporates beauty somehow.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.720]   - But why?
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:18.240]   Because beauty is a sign of health or something?
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.640]   I don't even.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.800]   - Oh, evolutionarily, maybe.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.520]   But then beauty becomes a signal of other things, right?
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:25.960]   So it's really not like,
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.400]   and then beauty becomes an adaptive trait.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.800]   So it can change with different,
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.560]   like maybe some species would think,
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.360]   well, you thought the frog having babies
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.840]   come out of its back was beautiful
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.400]   and I thought it was grotesque.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.560]   Like there's not a universal definition of what's beautiful.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.440]   It is something that is dependent on your history
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.520]   and how you interact with the world.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:49.680]   And I guess what I like about beauty,
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.240]   like any other concept, is when you turn it on its head.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:57.120]   So maybe the traditional conception
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.120]   of why women wear makeup and they dress certain ways
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.040]   is because they wanna look beautiful
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:07.240]   and pleasing to people.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.040]   And I just like to do it 'cause it's a confidence thing.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.920]   It's about embodying the person that I want to be
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.680]   and about owning that person.
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:21.160]   And then the way that people interact with that person
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.200]   is very different than if I didn't have the,
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:26.720]   like if I wasn't using that attribute as part of,
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.960]   and obviously that's influenced by the society I live
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.840]   and like what's aesthetically pleasing things.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.560]   But it's interesting to be able to turn that around
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.000]   and not have it necessarily be about the aesthetics,
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.560]   but about the power dynamics that the aesthetics create.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.880]   - But you're saying there's some function to beauty
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.640]   in that way, in the way you're describing,
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.840]   in the dynamic it creates in the social interaction.
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:47.560]   - Well, the point is you're saying it's an adaptive trait
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.320]   for like sexual selection or something.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:52.080]   And I'm saying that the adaptation that beauty confers
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.960]   is far richer than that.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:57.320]   And some of the adaptation is about social hierarchy
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:01.040]   and social mobility and just plain social dynamics.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.400]   Like why do some people dress goth?
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:05.360]   It's 'cause they identify with a community
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.920]   and a culture associated with that.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.120]   And they get, you know, and that's a beautiful aesthetic.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:11.360]   It's a different aesthetic.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.120]   Some people don't like it.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.160]   - So it has the same richness as does language.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.000]   - Yes.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:17.880]   - It's the same kind of--
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:22.400]   - Yes, and I think too few people think about
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.000]   the way that they, the aesthetics they build for themselves
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.680]   in the morning and how they carry it in the world
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:30.560]   and the way that other people interact with that
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.520]   because they put clothes on
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:35.800]   and they don't think about clothes as carrying function.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.920]   - Let's jump from beauty to language.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:41.080]   There's so many ways to explore the topic of language.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:44.060]   You called it, you said that language is,
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:47.080]   parts of language or language in itself
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.440]   and the mechanism of language is a kind of living life form.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.480]   You've tweeted a lot about this in all kinds of poetic ways.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.800]   Let's talk about the computation aspect of it.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.640]   You tweeted, "The world is not a computation,
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:03.720]   "but computation is our best current language
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.260]   "for understanding the world.
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.120]   "It is important we recognize this
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.060]   "so we can start to see the structure
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:11.140]   "of our future languages that will allow us
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:14.720]   "to see deeper than computation allows us."
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.720]   So what's the use of language in helping us understand
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.440]   and make sense of the world?
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:23.520]   - I think one thing that I feel like I notice
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.520]   much more viscerally than I feel like
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:27.840]   I hear other people describe
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:32.040]   is that the representations in our mind
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.320]   and the way that we use language
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:37.140]   are not the things like,
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:40.720]   actually, I mean, this is an important point
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.360]   going back to what Gertl did,
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.240]   but also this idea of signs and symbols
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.800]   and all kinds of ways of separating them.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.200]   There's like the word, right?
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.480]   And then there's like what the word means about the world.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.480]   And we often confuse those things.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.320]   And what I feel very viscerally,
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.960]   I almost sometimes think I have some kind of like
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.760]   synesthesia for language or something
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:03.160]   and I just like don't interact with it
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:04.860]   like the way that other people do.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:07.280]   But for me, words are objects
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.400]   and the objects are not the things that they describe.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.240]   They have like a different ontology to them.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:15.800]   Like they're physical things and they carry causation
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.180]   and they can create meaning,
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:23.180]   but they're not what we think they are.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:26.320]   And also like the internal representations in our mind,
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.980]   like the things I'm seeing about this room are probably,
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:30.640]   you know, like they're small projection
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:32.640]   of the things that are actually in this room.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.600]   And I think we have such a difficult time moving past
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:39.120]   the way that we build representations in the mind
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:40.680]   and the way that we structure our language
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.540]   to realize that those are approximations
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:43.940]   to what's out there and they're fluid
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:45.000]   and we can play around with them
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.400]   and we can see deeper structure underneath them
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.000]   that I think like we're missing a lot.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.520]   - Yeah, but also the life of the mind
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.080]   is in some ways richer than the physical reality.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:56.920]   - Sure.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:00.520]   - What's going on in your mind might be a projection
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.360]   - Right.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.560]   - of what's here, but there's also all kinds
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:04.760]   of other stuff going on there.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:05.880]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:08.640]   I love this essay by Poincaré
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:10.560]   about like mathematical creativity,
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.160]   where he talks about this sort of like frothing
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.680]   of all these things and then like somehow
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.080]   you build theorems on top of it
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.880]   and they become kind of concrete.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.960]   But like, and I also think about this with language.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:21.520]   It's like, there's a lot of stuff happening in your mind,
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.920]   but you have to compress it in this few sets of words
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.680]   to try to convey it to someone.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.300]   So it's a compactification of the space.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.440]   And it's not a very efficient one.
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:35.000]   And I think just recognizing
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.440]   that there's a lot that's happening behind language
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.280]   is really important.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.400]   I think this is one of the great things
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:44.280]   about the existential trauma of large language models,
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.160]   I think, is the recognition
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.640]   that language is not the only thing required.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.300]   Like there's something underneath it.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.260]   Not by everybody.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:59.160]   - Can you just speak to the feeling you have
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.020]   when you think about words?
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:03.560]   So is there, like, what's the magic of words to you?
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:04.720]   Is it, like, do you feel,
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:09.280]   it almost sometimes feels like you're playing with it.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.520]   - Yeah, I was just gonna say, it's like a playground.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.840]   - But you're almost like,
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.500]   I think one of the things you enjoy,
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.800]   maybe I'm projecting, is deviating,
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.760]   like using words in ways that not everyone uses them.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:25.400]   Like slightly sort of deviating from the norm a little bit.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.900]   - I love doing that in everything I do,
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.680]   but especially with language.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.040]   - But not so far that it doesn't make sense.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:32.000]   - Exactly.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000]   - So you're always, like, tethered to reality, to the norm,
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.880]   but, like, are playing with it.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.080]   Like basically fucking with people's minds a little bit.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.840]   I mean, like, you know,
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.280]   and in so doing, creating a different perspective
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.080]   on the thing that's been previously explored
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.400]   in a different way.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.600]   - Yeah, it's literally my favorite thing to do.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:57.800]   - Yeah, use words as one way to make people think.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.440]   - Yeah, so I, you know, a lot of my sort of,
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:05.920]   like, what happens in my mind when I'm thinking about ideas
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.760]   is I've been presented with this information
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:09.840]   about how people think about things.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:12.800]   And I try to go around to different communities
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.680]   and hear the ways that different,
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:16.240]   whether it's like, you know,
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.600]   hanging out with a bunch of artists or philosophers
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.880]   or scientists thinking about things.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.600]   Like they all think about it different ways.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.600]   And then I just try to figure out, like,
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.520]   how do you take the structure of the way
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:31.080]   that we're talking about it and turn it slightly?
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.000]   So you have all the same pieces
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.320]   that everybody sees are there,
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.040]   but the description that you've come up with
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.200]   seems totally different.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.440]   So they can understand that there's,
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.480]   like, they understand the pattern you're describing,
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.640]   but they never heard the structure underlying it
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.120]   described the way that you describe it.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.960]   - Is there words or terms you remember
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:54.960]   that disturbed people the most,
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.000]   maybe the positive sense of disturbed?
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.600]   This assembly theory, I suppose, is one.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.800]   - Yeah, I mean, the first couple sentences of that paper
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.000]   disturbed people a lot.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]   And I think they were really carefully constructed
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.480]   in exactly this kind of way.
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:09.320]   - What was that?
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:10.160]   Let me look it up.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.000]   - Oh, it was really fun.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.320]   But I think it's interesting 'cause I do,
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:19.000]   you know, sometimes I'm very upfront about it.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.640]   I say I'm gonna use the same word
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.640]   in probably six different ways in a lecture, and I will.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:26.680]   - You're right.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:27.680]   Scientists have grappled
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.720]   with reconciling biological evolution
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:33.080]   with immutable laws of the universe defined by physics.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:36.080]   These laws underpin life's origin, evolution,
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:36.920]   and the--
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.640]   - He came up with this with me when he was here, too.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.320]   - The development of human culture.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:44.480]   Well, he was, I think your love for words
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.160]   runs deeper than these.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.640]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.760]   I mean, this is part of the sort of brilliant thing
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.040]   about our collaboration is, you know,
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:56.720]   complementary skillsets.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.640]   So I love playing with the abstract space of language,
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.640]   and it's a really interesting playground
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:05.640]   when I'm working with Lee
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.280]   because he thinks at a much deeper level of abstraction
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.880]   than can be expressed by language.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.840]   And the ideas we work on
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.680]   are hard to talk about for that reason.
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:19.120]   - What do you think about computation as a language?
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.760]   - I think it's a very poor language.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.200]   A lot of people think it's a really great one,
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:25.200]   but I think it has some nice properties.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.240]   But I think the feature of it that, you know,
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.920]   is compelling is this kind of idea of universality
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.880]   that, like, you can, if you have a language,
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:37.640]   you can describe things in any other language.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.320]   - Well, for me, one of the people who kind of revealed
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:43.680]   the expressive power of computation,
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:46.160]   aside from Alan Turing, is Stephen Wolfram,
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.360]   through all the explorations
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:49.560]   of, like, cellular automata type of objects
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.280]   that he did in "A New Kind of Science" and afterwards.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.120]   So what do you get from that?
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.680]   The kind of computational worlds
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.320]   that are revealed through even something
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.560]   as simple as cellular automata.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.640]   It seems like that's a really nice way
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.160]   to explore languages that are far outside
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:14.880]   our human languages, and do so rigorously,
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.880]   and understand how those kinds of complex systems
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.480]   can interact with each other, can emerge,
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:23.640]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.360]   - I don't think that they're outside our human languages.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:29.960]   I think they define the boundary
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.440]   of the space of human languages.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.760]   - They allow us to explore things within that space,
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:36.160]   which is also fantastic.
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:38.560]   But I think there is a set of ideas that takes,
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.480]   and Stephen Wolfram has worked on this quite a lot,
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:45.000]   and contributed very significantly to it.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.800]   And, you know, I really like some of the stuff
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.560]   that Stephen's doing with, like, his physics project,
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.640]   but don't agree with a lot of the foundations of it.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.600]   But I think the space is really fun that he's exploring.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:58.400]   You know, there's this assumption
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:01.160]   that computation is at the base of reality.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:04.800]   And I kind of see it at the top of reality,
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:07.520]   not at the base, because I think computation
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:08.800]   was built by our biosphere.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.280]   It's something that happened
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.200]   after many billion years of evolution.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:16.600]   And it doesn't happen in every physical object.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.400]   It only happens in some of them.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:20.160]   And I think one of the reasons
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.440]   that we feel like the universe is computational
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.200]   is because it's so easy for us,
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:32.200]   as things that have the theory of computation in our minds,
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.640]   and actually, in some sense,
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.880]   it might be related to the functioning of our minds,
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:40.040]   and how we build languages to describe the world,
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:42.240]   and sets of relations to describe the world.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:47.840]   But it's easy for us to go out into the world
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.680]   and build computers.
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.520]   And then we mistake our ability to do that
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:55.040]   with assuming that the world is computational.
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:57.480]   And I'll give you a really simple example.
[01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.120]   This one came from John Conway.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.640]   I one time had a conversation with him,
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:03.480]   which was really delightful.
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:04.760]   He was really fun.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:08.760]   But he was pointing out that if you, you know,
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:11.920]   string lights in a barn, you know,
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:14.960]   you can program them to have your favorite
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.840]   one-dimensional CA,
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.600]   and you might even be able to make them, you know,
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.680]   do a, like, be capable of universal computation.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:26.000]   Is universal computation a feature of the string lights?
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000]   - Well, no.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.600]   - No, it's probably not.
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:31.280]   It's a feature of the fact that you, as a programmer,
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.400]   had a theory that you could embed
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:35.560]   in the physical architecture of the string lights.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:37.120]   Now, what happens, though,
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:39.320]   is we get confused by this kind of distinction
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.480]   between us as agents in the world
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:44.040]   that actually can transfer things that life does
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:47.640]   onto other physical substrates with what the world is.
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:51.200]   And so, for example, you'll see people, you know,
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.640]   doing, studying the mathematics
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:54.600]   of chemical reaction networks and saying,
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:57.200]   "Well, chemistry is Turing universal,"
[01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:59.080]   or studying the laws of physics and saying,
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.200]   "The laws of physics are Turing universal."
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:03.000]   But anytime that you wanna do that,
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.120]   you always have to prepare an initial state.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:08.480]   You have to, you know, you have to constrain the rule space,
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.840]   and then you have to actually be able to demonstrate
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:12.720]   the properties of computation.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:15.080]   And all of that requires an agent or a designer
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:16.160]   to be able to do that.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:19.600]   - But it gives you an intuition.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:22.600]   If you look at a 1D or 2D cellular automata,
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:25.720]   it gives you, it allows you to build an intuition
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:28.240]   of how you can have complexity emerge
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.200]   from very simple beginnings,
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.360]   very simple initial conditions.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:32.880]   - I think that's the intuition
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.240]   that people have derived from it.
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:37.960]   The intuition I get from cellular automata
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:40.360]   is that the flat space of an initial condition
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.440]   in a fixed dynamical law is not rich enough
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.040]   to describe an open-ended generation process.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.280]   And so the way I see cellular automata
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.560]   is they're embedded slices
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.080]   in a much larger causal structure.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.040]   And if you wanna look at a deterministic slice
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:52.960]   of that causal structure,
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.720]   you might be able to extract a set of consistent rules
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.400]   that you might call a cellular automata,
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.920]   but you could embed them as much larger space.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:03.080]   That's not dynamical and is about the causal structure
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.600]   relations between all of those computations.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.560]   And that would be the space cellular automata live in.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.080]   And I think that's the space that Stephen is talking about
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.360]   when he talks about his Rouliad
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.480]   and these hypergraphs of all these possible computations.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.880]   But I wouldn't take that as my base reality
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.280]   because I think, again, computation itself,
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.440]   this abstract property computation,
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.280]   is not at the base of reality.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.320]   - So can we just linger on that Rouliad?
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.600]   - Yeah.
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.920]   One Rouliad to rule them all.
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.920]   - Yeah, so this is part of Wolfram's physics project.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:39.320]   It's what he calls the entangled limit
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:42.040]   of everything that is computationally possible.
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:45.600]   So what's your problem with the Rouliad?
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.280]   - Well, it's interesting.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:50.400]   So Stephen came to a workshop we had in the Beyond Center
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.600]   in the fall, and the workshop theme was mathematics.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.080]   Is it evolved or eternal?
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:56.960]   And he gave a talk about the Rouliad.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:00.360]   And he was talking about how a lot of the things
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:01.760]   that we talk about in the Beyond Center,
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:04.200]   like does reality have a bottom?
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:05.800]   If it has a bottom, what is it?
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.920]   - I need to go to--
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.600]   - We'll have you to one sometime.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.440]   - This is great.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.720]   Does reality have a bottom?
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.560]   - Yeah, so we had one that was,
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:19.880]   it was called "Infinite Turtles or Ground Truth."
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:23.000]   And it was really just about this issue.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.560]   But the thing that was interesting,
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:27.400]   I think Stephen was trying to make the argument
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.040]   that fundamental particles aren't fundamental,
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:31.760]   gravitation is not fundamental.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.480]   These are just turtles, and computation is fundamental.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.520]   And I just, I remember pointing out to him,
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.920]   I was like, well, computation is your turtle.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.600]   And I think it's a weird turtle to have.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:47.320]   - First of all, isn't it okay to have a turtle?
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.120]   - It's totally fine to have a turtle.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:50.520]   Everyone has a turtle.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.960]   You can't build a theory without a turtle.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.880]   It's just, so it depends on the problem you wanna describe.
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:59.240]   And I actually, the reason I can't get behind
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:01.680]   Stephen's ontology is I don't know
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:03.760]   what question he's trying to answer.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.160]   And without a question to answer,
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:07.520]   I don't understand why you're building a theory of reality.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.360]   - And the question you're trying to answer is--
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:11.480]   - What life is.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.720]   - What life is, which, another simpler way of phrasing this,
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.520]   how did life originate?
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:19.440]   - Well, I started working on the origin of life.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:22.880]   And I think what my challenge was there
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:24.480]   was no one knew what life was.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.400]   And so you can't really talk about the origination
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.480]   of something if you don't know what it is.
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:31.600]   And so the way I would approach it is
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.080]   if you wanna understand what life is,
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.960]   then proving that physics is solving the origin of life.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:40.360]   So there's the theory of what life is,
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.000]   but there's the actual demonstration
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.920]   that that theory is an accurate description
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.440]   of the phenomena you aim to describe.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.720]   So again, they're the same problem.
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.600]   It's not like I can decouple origin of life
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:50.440]   from what life is.
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.400]   It's like that is the problem.
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:57.760]   And the point I guess I'm making about having a question
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.880]   is no matter what slice of reality you take,
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:04.040]   what regularity of nature you're gonna try to describe,
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.920]   there will be an abstraction
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:11.280]   that unifies that structure of reality, hopefully.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:16.280]   And that will have a fundamental layer to it, right?
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.760]   'Cause you have to explain something
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.480]   in terms of something else.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.160]   But so if I wanna explain life, for example,
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:24.880]   then my fundamental description of nature
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.200]   has to be something I think
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.840]   that has to do with time being fundamental.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.680]   But if I wanted to describe,
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:37.480]   I don't know, the sort of interactions of matter and light,
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:40.360]   you know, I have elementary particles be fundamental.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.720]   If I wanna describe electricity and magnetism in the 1800s,
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:47.340]   I have to have waves be fundamental, right?
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:50.120]   So like you, or in quantum mechanics,
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:52.240]   like it's a wave function that's fundamental
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:54.960]   'cause that's the sort of explanatory paradigm
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:55.800]   of your theory.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:02.920]   So I guess I don't know what problem
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:06.300]   saying computation is fundamental solves.
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:11.360]   - Doesn't he want to understand how does the basic,
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.800]   quantum mechanics and general relativity emerge?
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.120]   - Yeah, but that's-- - And how does time--
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.560]   - Right, so I think-- - But then that doesn't
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.040]   really answer an important question for us.
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.640]   - Well, I think that the issue is general relativity
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:23.920]   and quantum mechanics are expressed
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:26.040]   in mathematical languages.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:29.240]   And then computation is a mathematical language.
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:31.080]   So you're basically saying that maybe there's
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.920]   a more universal mathematical language
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:35.240]   for describing theories of physics that we already know.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:36.440]   That's an important question.
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:38.120]   And I do think that's what Stephen's trying to do
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:39.640]   and do well.
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:41.640]   But then the question becomes,
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.660]   does that formulation of a more universal language
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.800]   for describing the laws of physics that we know now
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:52.040]   tell us anything new about the nature of reality?
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:53.620]   Or is it a language?
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:57.920]   - NTU languages are fundamental, can be fundamental.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:02.040]   - The language itself is never the fundamental thing.
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.920]   It's whatever it's describing.
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:06.440]   - So one of the possible titles you were thinking about
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:10.880]   originally for the book is the hard problem of life.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:13.720]   Sort of reminiscent of the hard problem of consciousness.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.960]   So you're saying that assembly theory
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:18.560]   is supposed to be answering the question
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.040]   about what is life.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:22.160]   So let's go to the other hard problems.
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:25.400]   You also say that's the easiest of the hard problems
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:27.920]   is the hard problem of life.
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:34.800]   So what do you think is the nature of intelligence
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.000]   and consciousness?
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.240]   Do you think something like assembly theory
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:46.160]   can help us understand that?
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:51.160]   - I think if assembly theory is an accurate depiction
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:54.760]   of the physics of life,
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:58.360]   it should shed a lot of light on those problems.
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:00.080]   And in fact, I sometimes wonder
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:02.000]   if the problems of consciousness and intelligence
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.620]   are at all different than the problem of life generally.
[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:10.280]   And I'm of two minds of it,
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:12.360]   but I in general try to,
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:15.900]   the process of my thinking
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:18.260]   is trying to regularize everything into one theory.
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:20.980]   So pretty much every interaction I have is like,
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:22.700]   oh, how do I fold that into?
[02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:24.900]   And so I'm just building this giant abstraction
[02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:27.220]   that's basically trying to take every piece of data
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:31.280]   I've ever gotten in my brain into a theory of what life is.
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:34.740]   And consciousness and intelligence
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:36.820]   are obviously some of the most interesting things
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:38.160]   that life has manifest.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:40.820]   And so I think they're very telling
[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:43.620]   about some of the deeper features
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:45.060]   about the nature of life.
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:49.160]   - It does seem like they're all flavors of the same thing,
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:52.340]   but it's interesting to wonder at which stage
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:55.780]   there's something that we would recognize as life
[02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:58.780]   in a sort of canonical silly human way
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:02.660]   and something that we would recognize as intelligence.
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:04.140]   At which stage does that emerge?
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.260]   At which assembly index does that emerge
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:08.940]   and at which assembly index is it consciousness?
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:11.820]   Something that we would canonically recognize
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.660]   as consciousness.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.540]   Is this use of flavors the same as you meant
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:18.700]   when you were talking about flavors of alien life?
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:20.580]   - Yeah, sure, yeah.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:22.940]   I mean, it's the same as the flavors of ice cream
[02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:24.700]   and the flavors of fashion.
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.960]   - Yeah, but we were talking about in terms of colors
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:28.260]   and very nondescript.
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.020]   But the way that you just talked about flavors now
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:32.480]   was more in the space of consciousness and intelligence.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.540]   It was kind of much more specific.
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:38.620]   - It'd be nice if there was a formal way of expressing.
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:39.740]   - Quantifying flavors.
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:41.500]   - Quantifying flavors.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:46.260]   - It seems like I would order it
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:49.140]   life, consciousness, intelligence probably
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:52.100]   as like the order in which things emerge
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:54.000]   and they're all just the same.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.220]   We're using the word life differently here.
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:01.780]   I mean, life sort of when I'm talking about
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:04.220]   what is a living versus non-living thing
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:06.220]   at a bar with a person, I'm already like
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.540]   four or five drinks in, that kind of thing.
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:11.460]   - Just that. (laughs)
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:13.420]   - Like we're not being too philosophical.
[02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:14.740]   Like there's a thing that moves
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:16.540]   and here's a thing that doesn't move.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:21.500]   But maybe consciousness precedes that.
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:23.940]   It's a weird dance there.
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:29.040]   Is life precede consciousness or consciousness precede life?
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.820]   And I think that understanding of what life is
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:37.500]   in the way you're doing will help us disentangle that.
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:38.940]   - Depending on what you wanna explain,
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:39.780]   as I was saying before,
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.020]   you have to assume something's fundamental.
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:45.300]   And so because people can't explain consciousness,
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:46.940]   there's a temptation for some people
[02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:48.780]   to wanna take consciousness as fundamental
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.820]   and assume everything else is derived out of that.
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:52.460]   And then you get some people
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:56.300]   that wanna assume consciousness preceded life.
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:58.980]   And I don't find either of those views
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:00.640]   particularly illuminating.
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:05.140]   I think, 'cause I don't wanna assume a feminology
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:06.820]   before I explain a thing.
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:08.500]   And so what I've tried really hard to do
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:13.300]   is not assume that I think life is anything,
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:16.420]   except hold on to sort of the patterns and structures
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.500]   that seem to be the sort of consistent ways
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:19.660]   that we talk about this thing
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:22.500]   and then try to build a physics that describes that.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.340]   And I think that's a really different approach
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:27.940]   than saying consciousness is this thing
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:30.900]   we all feel and experience about things.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:33.620]   I would wanna understand the regularities
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.620]   associated with that and build a deeper structure
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:37.340]   underneath that and build into it.
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:39.340]   I wouldn't wanna assume that thing
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:40.740]   and that I understand that thing,
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:43.000]   which is usually how I see people talk about it.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.220]   - The difference between life and consciousness.
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:48.180]   - Yeah. - Which comes first.
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:51.740]   - Yeah, so I think if you're thinking about
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:55.300]   this sort of thinking about living things
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:57.820]   as these giant causal structures
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:59.420]   or these objects that are deep in time
[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:02.020]   or whatever language we end up using to describe it,
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:09.700]   it seems to me that consciousness is about
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:13.540]   the fact that we have a conscious experience
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:16.500]   is because we are these temporally extended objects.
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:19.260]   So consciousness and the abstraction that we have
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:21.380]   in our minds is actually a manifestation
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:22.940]   of all the time that's rolled up in us.
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:24.900]   And it's just because we're so huge
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:27.220]   that we have this very large inner space
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:29.100]   that we're experiencing that's not,
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.300]   and it's also separated off from the rest of the world
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.620]   because we're the separate thread in time.
[02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:36.140]   And so our consciousness is not exactly shared
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:38.620]   with anything else because nothing else occupies
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:42.220]   the same part of time that we occupy.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:45.700]   But I can understand something about you maybe being
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:48.420]   conscious because you and I didn't separate
[02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:52.860]   that far in the past in terms of our causal histories.
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:55.180]   So in some sense, we can even share experiences
[02:11:55.180 --> 02:11:57.020]   with each other through language
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.500]   because of that sort of overlap in our structure.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:05.540]   - Well then if consciousness is merely temporal separateness,
[02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:07.780]   then that comes before life.
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:09.860]   - It's not merely temporal separateness.
[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:11.940]   It's about the depth in that time.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:12.940]   So it's-- - Yes.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:14.740]   - The reason that my conscious experience
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:17.260]   is not the same as yours is because we're separated in time.
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.020]   The fact that I have a conscious experience
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:21.300]   is because I'm an object that's super deep in time.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.780]   So I'm huge in time.
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:25.780]   And that means that there's a lot,
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:28.020]   that I am basically, in some sense,
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:30.340]   a universe onto myself because my structure
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:33.300]   is so large relative to the amount of space that I occupy.
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:37.220]   - But it feels like that's possible to do
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:40.340]   before you get anything like bacteria.
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:42.340]   - I think there's a horizon,
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.100]   and I don't know how to articulate this yet.
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:46.340]   It's a little bit like the horizon at the origin of life
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:50.180]   where the space inside a particular structure
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:52.820]   becomes so large that it has some access
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:57.780]   to a space that's not, that doesn't feel as physical.
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:00.100]   It's almost like this idea of counterfactuals.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:05.820]   So I think the past history of your horizon
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:08.820]   is just much larger than can be encompassed
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:11.260]   in a small configuration of matter.
[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:14.380]   So you can pull this stuff into existence.
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:17.220]   This property is maybe a continuous property,
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:18.820]   but there's something really different
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:23.340]   about human-level physical systems
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:27.620]   and human-level ability to understand reality.
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:29.660]   I really love David Deutsch's conception
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:31.060]   of universal explainers,
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:34.780]   and that's related to the theory of universal computation.
[02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:40.260]   And I think there's some transition that happens there.
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:44.020]   But maybe to describe that a little bit better,
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:46.340]   what I can also say is what intelligence is
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:47.260]   in this framework.
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:52.140]   So you have these objects that are large in time.
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:54.980]   They were selected to exist by constraining
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:58.540]   the possible space of objects to this particular,
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.060]   like all of the matter is funneled
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:04.580]   into this particular configuration of object over time.
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:07.220]   And so these objects arise through selection,
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:09.860]   but the more selection that you have embedded in you,
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:12.460]   the more possible selection you have on your future.
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:16.780]   And so selection and evolution,
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:18.900]   we usually think about in the past sense
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:21.100]   where selection happened in the past,
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:26.900]   but objects that are high-density configurations of matter
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:28.580]   that have a lot of selection in them
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:31.220]   are also selecting agents in the universe.
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:33.380]   So they actually embody the physics of selection
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:35.500]   and they can select on possible futures.
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:38.660]   And I guess what I'm saying with respect to consciousness
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:40.660]   and the experience we have
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:43.460]   is that there's something very deep about that structure
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:46.100]   and the nature of how we exist in that structure
[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:50.380]   that has to do with how we're navigating that space
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:52.060]   and how we generate that space
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:54.420]   and how we continue to persist in that space.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.860]   - Is there shortcuts we can take
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:02.080]   to artificially engineering living organisms,
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:04.620]   artificial life, artificial consciousness,
[02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:06.500]   artificial intelligence?
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:09.700]   So maybe just looking pragmatically
[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:13.600]   at the LLMs we have now,
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:18.780]   do you think those can exhibit qualities of life,
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.900]   qualities of consciousness,
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:22.340]   qualities of intelligence
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.140]   in the way we think of intelligence?
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:25.460]   - I mean, I think they already do,
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.860]   but not in the way I hear popularly discussed.
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:31.340]   So there are obviously signatures of intelligence
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:36.340]   and a part of a ecosystem of intelligent systems,
[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:40.540]   but I don't know that individually,
[02:15:40.540 --> 02:15:44.900]   I would assign all the properties to them that people have.
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:46.540]   It's a little like,
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:48.900]   so we talked about the history of eyes before
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:52.580]   and like how I scaled up into technological forms
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:55.680]   and language has also had a really interesting history
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.340]   and got much more interesting,
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:59.660]   I think once we started writing it down
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:02.540]   and then in inventing books and things,
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:05.580]   but like every time that we started
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:08.280]   storing language in a new way,
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:11.980]   we were kind of existentially traumatized by it.
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:14.740]   So like the idea of written language was traumatic
[02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:17.360]   because it seemed like the dead were speaking to us
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.580]   even though they were deceased and books were traumatic
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:23.760]   because like suddenly there were lots of copies
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:25.660]   of this information available to everyone
[02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:28.300]   and it was gonna somehow dilute it.
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:30.940]   And large language models are kind of interesting
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.940]   because they don't feel as static, they're very dynamic.
[02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:35.420]   But if you think about language
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.700]   in the way I was describing before,
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:39.620]   is language is this very large in time structure
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:42.780]   and before it had been something that was distributed
[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:45.620]   over human brains as a dynamic structure
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:47.600]   and occasionally we store components
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:50.660]   of that very large dynamic structure
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:52.860]   in books or in written language.
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:56.620]   Now we can actually store the dynamics of that structure
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:16:59.940]   in a physical artifact, which is a large language model.
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:03.780]   And so I think about it almost like the evolution of genomes
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.980]   in some sense where there might've been
[02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:08.380]   like really primitive genes in the first living things
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.260]   and they didn't store a lot of information
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:11.840]   or they were like really messy.
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:14.580]   And then we, like by the time you get to the eukaryote cell
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.660]   you have this really dynamic genetic architecture
[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:18.260]   that's rewritable, right?
[02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:20.540]   And like, and it has all of these different properties.
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.740]   And I think large language models
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:25.980]   are kind of like the genetic system for language
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:29.600]   in some sense where it's allowing
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.900]   and a sort of archiving that's highly dynamic.
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:35.060]   And I think it's very paradoxical to us
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:37.100]   because obviously in human history
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:39.040]   we haven't been used to conversing
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:40.580]   with anything that's not human.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:45.580]   But now we can converse basically
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:50.580]   with a crystallization of human language in a computer
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:52.300]   that's a highly dynamic crystal
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:54.080]   because it's a crystallization in time
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:56.300]   of this massive abstract structure
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:58.380]   that's evolved over human history
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:01.180]   and is now put into a small device.
[02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:03.420]   - I think crystallization kind of implies
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:07.460]   that a limit on its capabilities.
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:10.640]   - I think there's not, I mean it very purposefully
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:13.360]   because a particular instantiation of a language model
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:14.900]   trained on a particular data set
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:17.380]   becomes a crystal of the language at that time it was trained
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:19.360]   but obviously we're iterating with the technology
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:20.460]   and evolving it.
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:23.060]   - I guess the question is when you crystallize it,
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:25.500]   when you compress it, when you archive it,
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:30.220]   you're archiving some slice of the collective intelligence
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:31.380]   of the human species.
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:32.220]   - That's right.
[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:36.220]   - And the question is like, how powerful is that?
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.500]   - Right, it's a societal level technology, right?
[02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:40.720]   We've actually put collective intelligence in a box.
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:44.960]   - Yeah, I mean how much smarter is the collective intelligence
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:47.560]   of humans versus a single human?
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:50.880]   And that's the question of AGI
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:54.000]   versus human level intelligence.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.400]   Superhuman level intelligence
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.580]   versus human level intelligence.
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:00.280]   Like how much smarter can this thing when done well,
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:04.720]   when we solve a lot of the computation complexities,
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:07.240]   maybe there's some data complexities
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:09.400]   and how to really archive this thing,
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:11.800]   crystallize this thing really well,
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:13.240]   how powerful is this thing gonna be?
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:14.080]   Like what's your--
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:19.040]   - I think, I actually, I don't like the sort of language
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:19.880]   we use around that
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:22.440]   and I think the language really matters.
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:23.920]   So I don't know how to talk about
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.300]   how much smarter one human is than another, right?
[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:31.520]   Like usually we talk about abilities
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:34.880]   or particular talents someone has.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:40.000]   And going back to David Reisch's idea
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.380]   of universal explainers,
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:47.400]   adopting the view that we're the first kinds of structures
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:49.040]   our biosphere has built
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.760]   that can understand the rest of reality.
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:54.260]   We have this universal comprehension capability.
[02:19:54.260 --> 02:20:00.160]   He makes an argument that basically we're the first things
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:02.480]   that actually are capable of understanding anything.
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:03.320]   It doesn't matter,
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.920]   it doesn't mean an individual understands everything,
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:07.860]   but like we have that capability.
[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:10.040]   And so there's not a difference between that
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.960]   and what people talk about with AGI.
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:15.560]   In some sense, AGI is a universal explainer.
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:19.800]   But it might be that a computer is much more efficient
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:24.560]   at doing, I don't know, prime factorization or something
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:25.880]   than a human is,
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:30.560]   but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily smarter
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:32.720]   or has a broader reach of the kind of things
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:35.280]   that can understand than a human does.
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:37.960]   And so I think we really have to think about,
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:41.720]   is it a level shift or is it we're enhancing
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.280]   certain kinds of capabilities humans have
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:46.320]   in the same way that we can enhance eyesight
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.720]   by making telescopes and microscopes?
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:52.240]   Are we enhancing capabilities we have into technologies
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:54.280]   and the entire global ecosystem
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:55.880]   is getting more intelligent?
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:58.280]   Or is it really that we're building some super machine
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:00.560]   in a box that's gonna be smart and kill everybody?
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:01.920]   Like, that sounds like a science,
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:03.960]   like it's not even a science fiction narrative,
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:05.720]   it's a bad science fiction narrative.
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:07.680]   I just don't think it's actually accurate
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:09.160]   to any of the technologies we're building
[02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.640]   or the way that we should be describing them.
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.840]   It's not even how we should be describing ourselves.
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:16.360]   - So the benevolent stories is a benevolent system
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:20.980]   that's able to transform our economy, our way of life
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:25.660]   by just 10X-ing the GDP of countries--
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:27.540]   - Well, these are human questions, right?
[02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:29.940]   I don't think they're necessarily questions
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:33.280]   that we're gonna outsource to an artificial intelligence.
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:36.100]   I think what is happening and will continue to happen
[02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:40.220]   is there's a co-evolution between humans and technology
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:41.100]   that's happening.
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:44.780]   And we're coexisting in this ecosystem right now
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:46.700]   and we're maintaining a lot of the balance.
[02:21:46.700 --> 02:21:49.740]   And for the balance to shift to the technology
[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:52.220]   would require some very bad human actors,
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:56.580]   which is a real risk, or some sort of,
[02:21:56.580 --> 02:22:03.540]   I don't know, some sort of dynamic that favors,
[02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:05.700]   like, I just don't know how that plays out
[02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:08.540]   without human agency actually trying to put it
[02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:09.580]   in that direction.
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:12.300]   - It could also be how rapid the rate--
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:13.720]   - The rapid rate is scary.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.980]   So like, I think the things that are terrifying
[02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:19.940]   are the ideas of deep fakes,
[02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:24.940]   or all the kinds of issues that become legal issues
[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:30.140]   about artificial intelligence technologies,
[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:32.780]   and using them to control weapons,
[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:37.780]   or using them for child pornography,
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:42.900]   or faking out that someone's loved one
[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:45.940]   was kidnapped or killed and ran--
[02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:48.060]   There's all kinds of things that are super scary
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:48.900]   in this landscape,
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:50.820]   and all kinds of new legislation needs to be built,
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:54.700]   and all kinds of guardrails on the technology
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:56.980]   to make sure that people don't abuse it need to be built.
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:58.980]   And that needs to happen.
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:01.180]   And I think one function of sort of
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:04.980]   the artificial intelligence doomsday
[02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:09.060]   sort of part of our culture right now
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:11.100]   is it's sort of our immune response
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.220]   to knowing that's coming.
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:15.540]   And we're overscaring ourselves,
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:17.780]   so we try to act more quickly, which is good.
[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:23.140]   But I just, it's about the words that we use
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:26.380]   versus the actual things happening behind the words.
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:27.860]   I think one thing that's good
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:29.620]   is when people are talking about things different ways,
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.340]   it makes us think about them.
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:34.940]   And also when things are existentially threatening,
[02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:36.700]   we wanna pay attention to those.
[02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:38.620]   But the ways that they're existentially threatening
[02:23:38.620 --> 02:23:41.180]   and the ways that we're experiencing existential trauma,
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:42.700]   I don't think that we're really gonna understand
[02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:44.700]   for another century or two, if ever.
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:47.140]   And I certainly think they're not the way
[02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:48.700]   that we're describing them now.
[02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:52.700]   - Well, creating existential trauma
[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:55.420]   is one of the things that makes life fun, I guess.
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:57.780]   - Yeah, it's just what we do to ourselves.
[02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:00.940]   - It gives us really exciting big problems to solve.
[02:24:00.940 --> 02:24:01.780]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:06.780]   - Do you think we will see these AI systems become conscious
[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:09.660]   or convince us that they're conscious?
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:12.460]   And then maybe we'll have relationships with them,
[02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:14.580]   romantic relationships?
[02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:15.660]   - Well, I think people are gonna have
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:17.180]   romantic relationships with them.
[02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:19.860]   And I also think that some people
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:21.780]   will be convinced already that they're conscious.
[02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:25.780]   But I think in order, what does it take to convince
[02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:31.660]   people that something is conscious?
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:33.820]   I think that we actually have to have an idea
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:35.540]   of what we're talking about.
[02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:38.740]   Like we have to have a theory that explains
[02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:41.500]   when things are conscious or not that's testable, right?
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:42.980]   And we don't have one right now.
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:44.900]   So I think until we have that,
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:46.940]   it's always gonna be this sort of gray area
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:47.780]   where some people think it has it
[02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:49.380]   and some people think it doesn't,
[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.420]   because we don't actually know what we're talking about
[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:52.420]   that we think it has.
[02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:54.980]   - So do you think it's possible to get out of the gray area
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:57.500]   and really have a formal test for consciousness?
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:24:58.340]   - For sure.
[02:24:58.340 --> 02:24:59.980]   - And for life as you were--
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:00.860]   - For sure.
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:02.540]   - As we've been talking about for some of the--
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:03.380]   - Yeah.
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:04.940]   - Consciousness is a tricky one.
[02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:05.820]   - It is a tricky one.
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:06.660]   I mean, that's why it's called
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:09.340]   the hard problem of consciousness, because it's hard.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:12.540]   And it might even be outside of the purview of science,
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:14.420]   which means that we can't understand it
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:15.460]   in a scientific way.
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.180]   There might be other ways of coming to understand it,
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:20.580]   but those may not be the ones that we necessarily want
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:23.260]   for technological utility
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:25.740]   or for developing laws with respect to,
[02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:28.420]   because the laws are the things
[02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:30.780]   that are gonna govern the technology.
[02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:31.860]   - Well, I think that's actually
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:35.660]   where the hard problem of consciousness,
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:37.540]   a different hard problem of consciousness,
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:42.540]   is that I fear that humans will resist.
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:46.620]   That's the last thing they will resist,
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:48.500]   is calling something else conscious.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:49.700]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:51.100]   I think it depends on the culture, though,
[02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:52.780]   because, I mean, some cultures already think
[02:25:52.780 --> 02:25:57.220]   like everything's imbued with a life essence
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:25:58.540]   or kind of conscious.
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:00.740]   - I don't think those cultures have nuclear weapons.
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:01.580]   - No, they don't.
[02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:02.420]   And they're probably not building
[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:04.340]   the most advanced technologies.
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:05.820]   - The cultures that are primed
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:08.060]   for destroying the other,
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:11.980]   constructing a very effective propaganda machines
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:13.220]   of what the other is,
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:15.940]   the group to hate,
[02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:19.780]   are the cultures that I worry would--
[02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:20.620]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:25.620]   - Would be very resistant to label something,
[02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:29.660]   to sort of acknowledge the consciousness
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:32.660]   laden in a thing that was created by us humans.
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:35.020]   - And so what do you think the risks are there
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:37.540]   that the conscious things will get angry with us
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:39.020]   and fight back?
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:42.500]   - No, that we would torture and kill conscious beings.
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:44.820]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.060]   I think we do that quite a lot.
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:50.180]   Anyway, without, I mean, I don't,
[02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:52.260]   I mean, it goes back to your,
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:54.260]   and I don't know how to feel about this,
[02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:55.820]   but, you know, like we talked already
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:57.060]   about the predator-prey thing,
[02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:00.420]   that like, in some sense, you know,
[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:03.180]   being alive requires eating other things that are alive.
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:04.740]   And even if you're a vegetarian,
[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:06.300]   or, you know, like try to have like,
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:09.340]   you're like, you're still eating living things.
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:11.500]   - So maybe part of the story of Earth
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:14.900]   will involve a predator-prey dynamic
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:19.820]   between humans and human creations.
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:20.660]   - Yeah.
[02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:21.500]   - And all of that is part of the--
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:24.180]   - But I don't like thinking about them as like,
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:26.140]   our technologies as a separate species,
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:27.300]   'cause this again goes back
[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:29.820]   to this sort of levels of selection issue.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:32.780]   And, you know, if you think about humans,
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:34.380]   individually alive,
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:37.340]   you miss the fact that societies are also alive.
[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:41.900]   And so I think about it much more in the sense of,
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:44.780]   an ecosystem's not the right word,
[02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:47.620]   but we don't have the right words for these things of like,
[02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:49.380]   and this is why I talk about the technosphere,
[02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:52.780]   it's a system that is both human and technological.
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:55.340]   It's not human or technological.
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:28:02.020]   And so this is the part that I think we're really good for,
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:04.460]   like, and this is driving in part a lot
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:06.860]   of the sort of attitude of like,
[02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:10.860]   I'll kill you first with my nuclear weapons.
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:13.860]   We're really good at identifying things as other.
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:16.660]   We're not really good at understanding when we're the same
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:18.460]   or when we're part of an integrated system
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:19.820]   that's actually functioning together
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:21.380]   in some kind of cohesive way.
[02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:23.180]   So even if you look at like, you know,
[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:26.020]   the division in American politics or something, for example,
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:27.900]   it's important that there's multiple sides
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.180]   that are arguing with each other
[02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:31.660]   because that's actually how you resolve society's issues.
[02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:33.020]   It's not like a bad feature.
[02:28:33.020 --> 02:28:35.740]   I think like some of the sort of extreme positions
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:39.340]   and like the way people talk about it are maybe not ideal,
[02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:42.860]   but that's how societies solve problems.
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:44.140]   What it looks like for an individual
[02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:46.420]   is really different than the societal level outcomes
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:49.140]   and the fact that like, there is,
[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:51.180]   I don't wanna call it cognition or computation,
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:52.380]   I don't know what you call it,
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:54.180]   but like there is a process playing out
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:55.780]   in the dynamics of societies
[02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:58.180]   that we are all individual actors in,
[02:28:58.180 --> 02:28:59.980]   and like, we're not part of that.
[02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:02.780]   It requires all of us acting individually,
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:05.060]   but like this higher level structure
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:06.660]   is playing out some things
[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:07.900]   and like things are getting solved
[02:29:07.900 --> 02:29:09.740]   for it to be able to maintain itself.
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:13.180]   And that's the level that our technologies live at.
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:14.500]   They don't live at our level.
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:15.900]   They live at the societal level
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:18.700]   and they're deeply integrated with the social organism,
[02:29:18.700 --> 02:29:20.060]   if you wanna call it that.
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:23.220]   And so I really get upset
[02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:25.420]   when people talk about the species
[02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:27.060]   of artificial intelligence.
[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:29.420]   I'm like, you mean we live in an ecosystem
[02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:31.100]   of all these kind of intelligent things
[02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:32.500]   and these animating technologies
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:36.220]   that we're in some sense helping to come alive.
[02:29:36.220 --> 02:29:37.900]   We are generating them,
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:39.300]   but it's not like the biosphere
[02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:41.060]   eliminated all of its past history
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:42.900]   when it invented a new species.
[02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:44.900]   All of these things get scaffolded
[02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:46.660]   and we're also augmenting ourselves
[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:48.340]   at the same time that we're building technologies.
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:49.620]   I don't think we can anticipate
[02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:51.020]   what that system's gonna look like.
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:52.380]   - So in some fundamental way,
[02:29:52.380 --> 02:29:54.140]   you always wanna be thinking about
[02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:55.980]   the planet as one organism.
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:58.060]   - The planet is one living thing.
[02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:00.100]   What happens when it becomes multi-planetary?
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:01.860]   Is it still just the--
[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:03.580]   - Still the same causal chain.
[02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:04.540]   - Same causal chain.
[02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:06.420]   - It's like when the first cell split into two.
[02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:07.620]   That's what I was talking about.
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:09.460]   When a planet reproduces itself,
[02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:12.580]   the technosphere emerges enough understanding.
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:14.220]   It's like this recursive,
[02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:17.260]   like the entire history of life is just recursion, right?
[02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:18.980]   So you have an original life event.
[02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:21.820]   It evolves for four billion years at least on our planet.
[02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:23.380]   It evolves a technosphere.
[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:26.340]   The technologies themselves start to become
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:29.100]   having this property we call life,
[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:31.060]   which is the phase we're undergoing now.
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:34.300]   It solves the origin of itself
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:37.060]   and then it figures out how that process all works,
[02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:38.460]   understands how to make more life
[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:40.420]   and then can copy itself onto another planet
[02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:42.620]   so the whole structure can reproduce itself.
[02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:46.780]   And so the original life is happening again right now
[02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:49.100]   on this planet in the technosphere
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:50.380]   with the way that our planet
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.100]   is undergoing another transition,
[02:30:52.100 --> 02:30:53.180]   just like at the original life
[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:55.540]   when geochemistry transitioned to biology,
[02:30:55.540 --> 02:30:56.700]   which is the global,
[02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:58.500]   for me it was a planetary scale transition.
[02:30:58.500 --> 02:30:59.860]   It was a multi-scale thing
[02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:01.340]   that happened from the scale of chemistry
[02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:02.980]   all the way to planetary cycles.
[02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:06.900]   It's happening now all the way from individual humans
[02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:10.020]   to the internet, which is a global technology
[02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:11.060]   and all the other things.
[02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:12.980]   Like there's this multi-scale process that's happening
[02:31:12.980 --> 02:31:14.380]   and transitioning us globally.
[02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:16.580]   And it is really like, it's a dramatic transition.
[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:20.900]   It's happening really fast and we're living in it.
[02:31:20.900 --> 02:31:22.500]   - You think this technosphere that we've created,
[02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:24.420]   this increasingly complex technosphere
[02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:26.100]   will spread to other planets?
[02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:26.940]   - I hope so.
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:28.660]   I think so.
[02:31:28.660 --> 02:31:31.740]   - You think we'll become a type two Kardashev civilization?
[02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:35.020]   - I don't really like the Kardashev scale.
[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:36.460]   And it goes back to like,
[02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:38.220]   I don't like a lot of the narratives about life
[02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:40.420]   'cause they're very like, you know,
[02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:42.940]   survival of the fittest, energy consuming,
[02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:43.780]   this, that, and the other thing.
[02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:45.140]   It's very like, I don't know,
[02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:49.180]   sort of old world, you know, like conqueror mentality.
[02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:51.140]   - What's the alternative to that exactly?
[02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:54.020]   - I mean, I think it does require life
[02:31:54.020 --> 02:31:57.700]   to use new energy sources in order to expand the way it is.
[02:31:57.700 --> 02:31:59.460]   So that part's accurate.
[02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:02.180]   But I think this sort of process of life,
[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:05.820]   like being the mechanism
[02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:08.460]   that the universe creatively expresses itself,
[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:11.820]   generates novelty, explores the space of the possible,
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:14.700]   is really the thing that's most deeply intrinsic to life.
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:16.180]   And so, you know,
[02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:20.500]   these sort of energy consuming scales of technology,
[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:24.260]   I think is missing the sort of actual feature
[02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:27.220]   that's most prominent about any alien life
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:28.100]   that we might find,
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:31.940]   which is that it's literally our universe, our reality,
[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:33.700]   trying to creatively express itself
[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:35.340]   and trying to find out what can't exist
[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:36.380]   and trying to make it exist.
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:38.420]   - See, but past a certain level of complexity,
[02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:40.380]   unfortunately, maybe you can correct me,
[02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:43.140]   but we're built, all complex life on Earth
[02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:45.980]   is built on a foundation of that predator-prey dynamic.
[02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:46.900]   - Yes.
[02:32:46.900 --> 02:32:48.660]   - And so like, I don't know if we can escape that.
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:49.860]   I don't know how-- - No, we can't.
[02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:52.860]   - But this is why I'm okay with having a finite lifetime.
[02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:55.300]   And, you know, one of the reasons I'm okay with that,
[02:32:55.300 --> 02:32:58.140]   actually, goes back to this issue
[02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:00.420]   of the fact that we're resource bound.
[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:02.060]   We live in a, you know, like,
[02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:04.340]   we have a finite amount of material,
[02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:06.340]   whatever way you wanna define material, I think,
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:08.940]   like for me, you know, material is time,
[02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:10.580]   material is information,
[02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:12.900]   but we have a finite amount of material.
[02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:14.900]   If time is a generating mechanism,
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:18.020]   it's always gonna be finite because the universe is,
[02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:20.900]   you know, like, it's a resource that's getting generated,
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:22.020]   but it has a size,
[02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:26.980]   which means that all the things that could exist
[02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:29.620]   don't exist, and in fact, most of them never will.
[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:32.100]   So death is a way to make room in the universe
[02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:33.060]   for other things to exist
[02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:34.780]   that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise.
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:37.460]   So if the universe, over its entire temporal history,
[02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:39.060]   wants to maximize the number of things,
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:41.180]   wants is a hard word, maximize is a hard word,
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:42.460]   all these things are approximate,
[02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:45.820]   but wants to maximize the number of things that can exist,
[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:48.060]   the best way to do it is to make recursively
[02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:49.740]   embedded stacked objects like us
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:53.020]   that have a lot of structure and a small volume of space,
[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:55.060]   and to have those things turn over rapidly
[02:33:55.060 --> 02:33:58.060]   so you can create as many of them as possible.
[02:33:58.060 --> 02:34:01.300]   - So there for sure is a bunch of those kinds of things
[02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:02.340]   throughout the universe.
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:03.740]   - Hopefully.
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:05.540]   Hopefully our universe is teeming with life.
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:07.340]   - This is like early on in the conversation,
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:11.660]   you mentioned that we really don't understand much,
[02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:14.540]   like there's mystery all around us.
[02:34:14.540 --> 02:34:15.380]   - Yes.
[02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:18.020]   - We have to like bet money on it, like what percent?
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:21.300]   So like say a million years from now,
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:26.300]   the story of science and human understanding,
[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:32.220]   understanding that started on Earth is written,
[02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:34.620]   like what chapter are we on?
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:39.620]   Are we like, is this like 1%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 90%?
[02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:42.500]   How much do we understand?
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:44.100]   Like the big stuff.
[02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:48.060]   - Not like the details of like big,
[02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:51.580]   important questions and ideas.
[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:55.500]   - I think we're in our 20s and--
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:56.580]   - 20% of the 20%?
[02:34:56.580 --> 02:34:59.300]   - No, like age wise, let's say we're in our 20s,
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.060]   but the lifespan is gonna keep getting longer.
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:02.900]   - You can't do that.
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:03.820]   - I can.
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:05.140]   You know why I use that though?
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:07.940]   I'll tell you why, why my brain went there,
[02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:12.380]   is because anybody that gets an education in physics
[02:35:12.380 --> 02:35:15.620]   has this sort of trope about how all the great physicists
[02:35:15.620 --> 02:35:18.460]   did their best work in their 20s.
[02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:20.340]   And then you don't do any good work after that.
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:22.340]   And I always thought it was kind of funny,
[02:35:22.340 --> 02:35:26.780]   because for me, physics is not complete.
[02:35:26.780 --> 02:35:31.740]   It's not nearly complete, but most physicists think
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:34.460]   that we understand most of the structure of reality.
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:37.500]   And so I think I actually,
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:39.420]   I think I put this in the book somewhere,
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:44.100]   but this idea to me that societies would discover everything
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:46.060]   while they're young is very consistent
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:48.940]   with the way we talk about physics right now.
[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:50.900]   But I don't think that's actually the way
[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:51.900]   that things are gonna go.
[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:54.460]   And you're finding that people
[02:35:54.460 --> 02:35:58.060]   that are making major discoveries are getting older
[02:35:58.060 --> 02:35:59.300]   in some sense than they were,
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:01.340]   and our lifespan is also increasing.
[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:04.780]   So I think there is something about age
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:06.060]   and your ability to learn
[02:36:06.060 --> 02:36:08.260]   and how much of the world you can see
[02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:10.780]   that's really important over a human lifespan,
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:12.900]   but also over the lifespan of societies.
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:16.020]   And so I don't know how big the frontier is.
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:18.340]   I don't actually think it has a limit.
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:22.340]   I don't believe in infinity as a physical thing,
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:25.660]   but I think as a receding horizon,
[02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:27.320]   I think because the universe is getting bigger,
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:28.780]   you can never know all of it.
[02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:34.460]   - Well, I think it's about 1.7%.
[02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:36.060]   - 1.7, where does that come from?
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:38.860]   It's a finite, I don't know, I just made it up.
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:40.900]   - That number had to come from somewhere.
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:44.620]   - I think seven is the thing that people usually pick.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:45.540]   - 7%?
[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:49.460]   - So I wanted to say 1%, but I thought it'd be funnier
[02:36:49.460 --> 02:36:53.460]   to add a point, so humor, inject a little humor in there.
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:54.700]   So the seven is for the humor.
[02:36:54.700 --> 02:36:59.220]   One is for how much mystery I think there is out there.
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:01.900]   - 99% mystery, 1% known.
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:04.780]   - In terms of really big, important questions.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:06.500]   - Yeah. - It's like the list,
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:08.460]   say there's gonna be like 200 chapters.
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:10.460]   Like the stuff that's gonna remain true.
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:14.460]   - But you think the book has a finite size.
[02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:15.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:16.380]   - And I don't.
[02:37:16.380 --> 02:37:19.580]   I mean, not that I believe in infinities,
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:22.220]   but I don't, I think the size of the book is growing.
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:25.900]   - Well, the fact that the size of the book is growing
[02:37:25.900 --> 02:37:28.500]   is one of the chapters in the book.
[02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:29.860]   - Oh, there you go.
[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:31.780]   Oh, we're being recursive.
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:33.100]   (laughing)
[02:37:33.700 --> 02:37:36.620]   - You can't have an ever-growing book.
[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:37.700]   - Yes, you can.
[02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:39.820]   - I mean, you just, I mean, I don't even.
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:41.620]   Because then--
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:42.780]   - Well, you couldn't have been asking this
[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:43.820]   at the origin of life, right?
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:45.780]   Because obviously like you wouldn't have existed
[02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:46.620]   at the origin of life.
[02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:48.620]   But like the question of intelligence
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:51.020]   and artificial general, like those questions
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:52.900]   did not exist then.
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:56.020]   And so, and they in part existed
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:57.460]   because the universe invented a space
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:38:01.020]   for those questions to exist through evolution.
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:04.740]   - But like, I think that question will still stand
[02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:06.100]   a thousand years from now.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:07.700]   - It will, but there will be other questions
[02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:10.140]   we can't anticipate now that we'll be asking.
[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:13.740]   - Yeah, and maybe we'll develop the kinds of languages
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:15.540]   that we'll be able to ask much better questions.
[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:18.220]   - Right, or like the theory of like gravitation,
[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:20.260]   for example, like when we invented that theory,
[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:22.700]   like we only knew about the planets in our solar system.
[02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:24.980]   Right, and now, you know, many centuries later,
[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:26.700]   we know about all these planets around other stars
[02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:27.940]   and black holes and other things
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:29.900]   that we could never have anticipated.
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:33.020]   So, and then we can ask questions about them.
[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:34.260]   You know, like we wouldn't have been asking
[02:38:34.260 --> 02:38:36.340]   about singularities and like,
[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:38.260]   can they really be physical things in the universe
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.100]   several hundred years ago?
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:40.500]   That question couldn't exist.
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:44.840]   - Yeah, but it's not, I still think
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:47.060]   those are chapters in a book.
[02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:48.820]   Like I don't get a sense from that.
[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:51.780]   - So do you think the universe has an end?
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:54.140]   If you think it's a book with an end?
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:57.380]   - I think the number of words required
[02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:00.100]   to describe how the universe works has an end, yes.
[02:39:00.100 --> 02:39:06.100]   Meaning like, I don't care if it's infinite or not.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:06.940]   - Right.
[02:39:06.940 --> 02:39:09.780]   - As long as the explanation is simple and it exists.
[02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:10.700]   - Oh, I see.
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:13.980]   - And I think there is a finite explanation
[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:15.460]   for each aspect of it.
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:18.340]   The consciousness, the life.
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:19.180]   - Yeah.
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:22.660]   - I mean, very probably there's like some,
[02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:26.860]   the black hole thing is like, what's going on there?
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:27.700]   Where's that going?
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:29.580]   Like, where did they, what?
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:32.420]   And then, you know, why the big bang?
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:33.820]   Like, what?
[02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:34.660]   - Right.
[02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:37.580]   - It's probably there's just a huge number of universes
[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:40.220]   and it's like universes inside universe.
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:43.780]   - I think universes inside universes is maybe possible.
[02:39:43.780 --> 02:39:44.980]   - I just think it's,
[02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:50.620]   every time we assume this is all there is,
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:52.980]   it turns out there's much more.
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:54.260]   - The universe is a huge place.
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:55.980]   - And when we mostly talked about the past
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:57.020]   and the richness of the past,
[02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:59.580]   but the future, I mean, with many worlds,
[02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:02.860]   interpretation of quantum mechanics, so--
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:04.380]   - Oh, I am not a many worlds person.
[02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:05.220]   - You're not.
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:06.900]   - No, are you?
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:08.020]   How many Lexus are there?
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:09.460]   - Depending on the day.
[02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:10.300]   Well--
[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:11.620]   - Do some of them wear yellow jackets?
[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:14.860]   - At the moment you asked the question, there was one.
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:16.060]   At the moment I'm answering it,
[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:18.800]   there's now near infinity, apparently.
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:24.980]   I mean, the future is bigger than the past, yes?
[02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:25.820]   - Yes.
[02:40:25.820 --> 02:40:26.660]   - I think so.
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:28.860]   - In the past, according to you, it's already gigantic.
[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:30.380]   - Yeah, but yeah, I mean,
[02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:31.900]   that's consistent with many worlds, right?
[02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:34.220]   'Cause there's this constant branching.
[02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:36.980]   But it doesn't really have a directionality to it.
[02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:39.540]   It's a, I don't know, many worlds is weird.
[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:41.700]   So my interpretation of reality is like,
[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:44.780]   if you fold it up, all that bifurcation of many worlds,
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:46.980]   and you just fold it into the structure that is you,
[02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:50.020]   and you just said you are all of those many worlds,
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:54.660]   and that sort of, your history converged on you,
[02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:57.620]   but you're actually an object exists that's like,
[02:40:57.620 --> 02:41:00.140]   that was selected to exist,
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:02.900]   and you're self-consistent with the other structures.
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:04.740]   So the quantum mechanical reality
[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:06.420]   is not the one that you live in.
[02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:10.580]   It's this very deterministic classical world,
[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:14.340]   and you're carving a path through that space.
[02:41:14.340 --> 02:41:16.900]   But I don't think that you're constantly
[02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:18.300]   branching into new spaces.
[02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:19.780]   I think you are that space.
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:23.260]   - Wait, so to you, at the bottom, it's deterministic.
[02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:24.260]   I thought you said the universe is--
[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:26.380]   - No, it's random at the bottom, right?
[02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:28.020]   But like this randomness that we see
[02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:30.900]   at the bottom of reality, that is quantum mechanics,
[02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:33.980]   I think people have assumed that that is reality.
[02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:36.100]   And what I'm saying is,
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:37.840]   all those things you see in many worlds,
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:39.320]   all those versions of you,
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:42.020]   just collect them up and bundle them up,
[02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:43.820]   and they're all you.
[02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:46.820]   And what has happened is,
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:48.620]   elementary particles don't have,
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:50.580]   they don't live in a deterministic universe,
[02:41:50.580 --> 02:41:52.780]   the things that we study in quantum experiments.
[02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:55.020]   They live in this fuzzy random space.
[02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:57.060]   But as that structure collapsed
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:59.620]   and started to build structures that were deterministic
[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:01.220]   and evolved into you,
[02:42:01.220 --> 02:42:04.820]   you are a very deterministic macroscopic object.
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:06.460]   And you can look down on that universe
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:09.000]   that doesn't have time in it, that random structure.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.420]   And you can see that all of these possibilities
[02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:14.140]   look possible, but they don't look,
[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:15.440]   they're not possible for you,
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:17.660]   because you're constrained by this giant
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:19.580]   causal structural history.
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:24.060]   So you can't live in all those universes.
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:25.860]   You'd have to go all the way back
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:27.780]   to the very beginning of the universe
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:29.860]   and retrace everything again to be a different you.
[02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:31.280]   - So where's the source of the free will
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:32.580]   for the macro object?
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:37.320]   - It's the fact that you're a deterministic structure
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:38.880]   living in a random background.
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:41.220]   And also all of that selection bundled in you
[02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:43.180]   allows you to select on possible futures,
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:44.940]   so that's where your will comes from.
[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:46.840]   And there's just always a little bit of randomness,
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:48.740]   because the universe is getting bigger.
[02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:53.700]   And this idea that the past and the present
[02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:57.180]   is not large enough yet to contain the future,
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:43:00.140]   the extra structure has to come from somewhere.
[02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:03.140]   And some of that is because outside of those
[02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:06.520]   giant causal structures that are things like us,
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:08.420]   it's fucking random out there.
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:11.260]   And it's scary.
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:12.620]   And we're all hanging on to each other,
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:14.780]   because the only way to hang on to each other,
[02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:17.380]   the only way to exist is to cling on
[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:18.780]   to all of these causal structures
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:21.900]   that we happen to co-inhabit existence with
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:24.460]   and try to keep reinforcing each other's existence.
[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:27.380]   - All the selection bundled in.
[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:28.220]   - And us.
[02:43:28.220 --> 02:43:30.500]   But free will's totally consistent with that.
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:31.740]   - I don't know what I think about that.
[02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:33.940]   That's complicated to imagine.
[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:36.780]   Just that little bit of randomness is enough.
[02:43:36.780 --> 02:43:37.620]   Okay.
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:39.660]   - Well, it's also, it's not just the randomness.
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:40.480]   There's two features.
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:42.660]   One is randomness helps generate some novelty
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:44.060]   and some flexibility.
[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:47.180]   But it's also that because you're the structure
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:48.580]   that's deep in time,
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:51.460]   you have this combinatorial history that's you.
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:55.440]   And I think about time and assembly theory,
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:57.980]   not as linear time, but as combinatorial time.
[02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:00.140]   So if you have all of this structure
[02:44:00.140 --> 02:44:01.880]   that you're built out of,
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:04.940]   you, in principle, you know,
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:07.600]   your future can be combinations of that structure.
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:10.140]   You obviously need to persist yourself as a coherent you.
[02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:13.980]   So you wanna optimize for a future
[02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:17.660]   in that combinatorial space that still includes you
[02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:20.860]   most of the time for most of us.
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:25.340]   And when you make those kinds of,
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:28.460]   and then that gives you a space to operate in.
[02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:30.620]   And that's your sort of horizon
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:32.900]   where your free will can operate.
[02:44:32.900 --> 02:44:34.620]   And your free will can't be instantaneous.
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:37.220]   So for like example, like I'm sitting here
[02:44:37.220 --> 02:44:38.060]   talking to you right now,
[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:41.180]   I can't be in the UK and I can't be in Arizona,
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:42.760]   but I could plan.
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:44.620]   I could execute my free will over time
[02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:47.700]   because free will is a temporal feature of life
[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:50.620]   to be there, you know, tomorrow or the next day
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:51.460]   if I wanted to.
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.900]   - But what about like the instantaneous decisions
[02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:56.420]   you're making, like to, I don't know,
[02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:58.140]   to put your hand on the table?
[02:44:58.140 --> 02:44:58.980]   That's--
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:01.540]   - I think those were already decided a while ago.
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:05.020]   I don't think free will is ever instantaneous.
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:07.940]   - But on a longer time horizon,
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:10.340]   there's some kind of steering going on?
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:11.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:14.480]   - And who's doing the steering?
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:15.320]   - You are.
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:16.160]   - Hmm.
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:20.920]   And you being this macro object that's encompasses.
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:22.320]   - Or you being Lex.
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:24.000]   (laughs)
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:25.200]   Whatever you wanna call it.
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.040]   (laughs)
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:31.280]   - There you are saying words to things once again.
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:32.240]   - I know.
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.240]   - Why does anything exist at all?
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:39.200]   You've kind of taken that as a starting point.
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:40.040]   - Yeah.
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:40.880]   - Why do things exist?
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:42.800]   - I think that's the hardest question.
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:45.560]   - Isn't it just hard questions stacked on top of each other?
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:46.400]   - It is.
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:49.160]   - Wouldn't it be the same kind of question of what is life?
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:50.080]   - It is the same.
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:51.940]   Well, that's sort of like, I try to fold
[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:53.640]   all of the questions into that question
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:55.400]   'cause I think that one's really hard.
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:57.640]   And I think the nature of existence is really hard.
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:45:59.760]   - You think actually like answering what is life
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:01.260]   will help us understand existence?
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:05.600]   Maybe there's, it's turtles all the way down.
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:08.680]   It'll just, understanding the nature of turtles
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:11.040]   will help us kind of march down,
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:13.960]   even if we don't have the experimental methodology
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:15.800]   of reaching before the Big Bang.
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:16.720]   - Right.
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.400]   So, well I think there's sort of two questions embedded here.
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:22.680]   I think the one that we can't answer by answering life
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:26.760]   is why certain things exist and others don't.
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:30.360]   But I think the sort of ultimate question,
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:32.460]   the sort of like prime mover question
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:36.160]   of why anything exists, we will not be able to answer.
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:38.440]   - What's outside the universe?
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.720]   - Oh, there's nothing outside the universe.
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.300]   So I have a very, I am a very,
[02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:49.080]   I am like the most physicalist that like anyone could be.
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:53.240]   So like for me, everything exists in our universe.
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.240]   And I like to think like everything exists here.
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:00.520]   So even when we talk about the multiverse,
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:02.300]   I don't like, to me, it's not like
[02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:03.560]   there's all these other universes
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:05.020]   outside of our universe that exists.
[02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:09.440]   The multiverse is a concept that exists in human minds here.
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:12.900]   And it allows us to have some counterfactual reasoning,
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:14.720]   to reason about our own cosmology,
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:17.100]   and therefore it's causal in our biosphere
[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:19.540]   to understanding the reality that we live in
[02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:21.240]   and building better theories.
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:24.100]   But I don't think that the multiverse is something like,
[02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:26.960]   and also math, like I don't think there's a platonic world
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:28.840]   that mathematical things live in.
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:32.700]   I think mathematical things are here on this planet.
[02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:33.880]   Like I don't think it makes sense
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:36.720]   to talk about things that exist outside of the universe.
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:38.400]   If you're talking about them,
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:39.600]   you're already talking about something
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:42.120]   that exists inside the universe and is part of the universe
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:44.320]   and is part of like what the universe is building.
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.160]   - It all originates here, it all exists here in some--
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:49.420]   - I mean, what else would there be?
[02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:52.440]   - There could be things you can't possibly understand
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:55.000]   outside of all of this that we call the universe.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:55.920]   - And you can say that,
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:57.460]   and that's an interesting philosophy.
[02:47:57.460 --> 02:47:59.860]   But again, this is sort of like pushing on the boundaries
[02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:01.840]   of like the way that we understand things.
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:04.280]   I think it's more constructive to say
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:05.920]   the fact that I can talk about those things
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:07.640]   is telling me something about the structure
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:09.560]   of where I actually live and where I exist.
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:10.960]   - Just because it's more constructive
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.160]   doesn't mean it's true.
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:15.740]   - Well, it may not be true.
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:17.640]   It may be something that allows me
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:19.400]   to build better theories I can test
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:21.240]   to try to understand something objective.
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:25.120]   - And in the end, that's a good way to get to the truth.
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:26.000]   - Exactly.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.680]   - Even if you realize you were wrong in the past.
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:32.400]   - Yeah, so there's no such thing as experimental Platonism.
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:34.680]   But if you think math is an object
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:35.780]   that emerged in our biosphere,
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:37.920]   you can start experimenting with that idea.
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:41.600]   And that, to me, is really interesting.
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:43.520]   Like to think about, well, people,
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.080]   I mean, mathematicians do think about math
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:46.500]   sometimes as an experimental science.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:48.920]   But to think about math itself
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:53.920]   as an object for study by physicists
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:57.240]   rather than a tool physicists use to describe reality,
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:00.240]   becomes the part of reality they're trying to describe,
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:02.240]   to me, is a deeply interesting inversion.
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:03.600]   - What to you is most beautiful
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:08.440]   about this kind of exploration of the physics of life
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:09.640]   that you've been doing?
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:12.820]   - I love the way it makes me feel.
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:18.840]   - And then you have to try to convert the feelings
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.280]   into visuals and the visuals into words.
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:23.040]   - Yeah, so I think I love,
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:24.880]   yeah, I love the way it makes me feel
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:29.840]   to have ideas that I think are novel.
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:32.320]   And I think that the dual side of that
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:34.720]   is the painful process of trying to communicate that
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:35.900]   with other human beings
[02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:38.580]   to test if they have any kind of reality to them.
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:41.680]   And I also love that process.
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:43.720]   I love trying to figure out
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:46.840]   how to explain really deep, abstract things
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:49.440]   that I don't think that we understand
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:51.640]   and trying to understand them with other people.
[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:53.480]   And I also love the shock value
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:58.480]   of this kind of idea we were talking about before
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:01.600]   of being on the boundary of what we understand.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:03.960]   And so people can kind of see what you're seeing,
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:06.560]   but they haven't ever saw it that way before.
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.520]   And I love the shock value that people have,
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:12.360]   like that immediate moment of recognizing
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:13.720]   that there's something beyond the way
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:15.480]   that they thought about things before.
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:17.360]   And being able to deliver that to people,
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:19.400]   I think is one of the biggest joys that I have,
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:22.040]   is just like, maybe it's that sense of mystery,
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.920]   like to share that there's something beyond the frontier
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:27.400]   of how we understand, and we might be able to see it.
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:31.520]   - And you get to see the humans transformed by the new idea?
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:32.840]   - Yes.
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:36.800]   And I think my greatest wish in life
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:38.840]   is to somehow contribute to an idea
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:42.120]   that transforms the way that we think.
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:45.080]   Like, I have my problem I wanna solve,
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:47.080]   but the thing that gives me joy about it
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:49.020]   is really changing something.
[02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:53.520]   And ideally getting to a deeper understanding
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:56.540]   of how the world works, and what we are.
[02:50:56.540 --> 02:51:01.600]   - Yeah, I would say understanding life at a deep level
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:06.000]   is probably one of the most exciting problems,
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.760]   one of the most exciting questions.
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:12.480]   So I'm glad you're trying to answer just that,
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:13.960]   and doing it in style.
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.680]   - It's the only way to do anything.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:19.480]   - Thank you so much for this amazing conversation,
