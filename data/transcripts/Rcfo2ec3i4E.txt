[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   If you sign up for a bank that has a referral bonus, let's say $100,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.880]   you sign up, you get $100.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.960]   If someone else signs up, they get $100.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040]   But if you sign up, get $100, and then you refer, let's say, your spouse,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.560]   they get $100, but you also get $100 for signing them up.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.640]   So now it becomes $300 instead of just your $100.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.200]   And that's how you can scale things quite a bit.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.520]   It could be also just like your cousin or your friend
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.160]   that you're, like, you know, been friends with for a decade.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.000]   There's so many ways to acquire a Player 2 or Player 3 or Player 4.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.520]   There's some people that I chat with that have 10 plus players.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.320]   And for them, it really is a full-scale business
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.480]   where they're managing multiple players,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.040]   doing multiple bank bonuses, all these bonuses.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840]   Because if you imagine I'm just making $36,000 between me and my P2,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.440]   if you had 10 players, that's over $150,000.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   And maybe you were working on this 40 hours a week instead of just 10 or 15.
