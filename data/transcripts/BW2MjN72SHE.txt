[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.020]   - Welcome to 2022, into the first episode
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.920]   in our 10th full year on the podcast now.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.300]   It's amazing, I had no idea we were launching something
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.780]   that would last a decade, but here we are Pastor John.
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.020]   And the year begins with a question
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.140]   over idolatry of all things.
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.060]   It's a good one too, it's from an anonymous man.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.460]   Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.020]   What exactly is an idol?
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.660]   Christians use the term all the time,
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.140]   especially in sermons, so I go to my Bible.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.700]   There I find that idols were statues or figurines,
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.140]   worshipers bending down to quote,
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.180]   "Gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone."
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.460]   That's Daniel 5.4.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.340]   Sometimes it seems idols were talisman like items
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.340]   to ward off bad things,
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.220]   trinkets in the form of golden tumors or golden mice.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.300]   I'm thinking here of 1 Samuel 5,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.100]   verse six to 1 Samuel 7, verse two.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.220]   But today's idols are very different.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.140]   They seem to be desires of the heart for money,
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.900]   sex, power, and things like that.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.380]   How did this come to be?
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.700]   Idols used to be carved things,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.500]   now they are heart obsessions.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.660]   I don't understand the link between statues and heart idols.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.340]   In fact, when I look at the Old Testament idols
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.960]   of tumors and mice, I don't really understand those either.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.620]   Can you explain both forms of idolatry
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.140]   and how they are connected?
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.700]   Yeah, well, I'll try.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.500]   Let's start with the definition.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.740]   I think to cover all the cases,
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.900]   we should probably define an idol,
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.020]   and I think this is a biblical definition,
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.020]   as anything that we come to rely on
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.460]   for some blessing or help or guidance
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.420]   in the place of a wholehearted reliance
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.380]   on the true and living God.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.260]   So that's my working definition of idol.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.020]   So you can see that would cover, for example,
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.380]   a rabbit's foot in your pocket
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.140]   or a picture of a saint hanging on your wall
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.300]   or a relic from some sacred shrine sitting on your mantle
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.940]   or the more forthright images taken
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.460]   from Hindu or Buddhist temples
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.220]   or the golden calf that Aaron made
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.620]   while Moses was on the mountain.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.100]   And what makes all of those idols
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.300]   is that we are looking away
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.700]   from a wholehearted reliance upon the true and living God
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.180]   through Jesus Christ,
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.180]   and we are looking at the rabbit's foot
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.600]   or the relic or the picture
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.420]   for some special protection or blessing or guidance or help
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.700]   that we don't think we could get by just looking to God.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.960]   Now, our friend who sent this question in is right,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.300]   I think, that in the Bible,
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.140]   the word idol is uniformly used
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.260]   for an actual object from nature
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.300]   or more often made by human hands.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.900]   You don't find the word idolatry used
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.540]   to describe excessive love for your wife
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.180]   or your lands or your money or your pocketbook.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.220]   And so I think he's right that in the Bible,
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.600]   there's this distinct focus on a man-made object
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.520]   or something from nature
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520]   rather than just this strong craving and desire for stuff.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.260]   Now, behind that is correctly the second commandment,
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.540]   you shall not make for yourself a carved image
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.980]   or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.740]   or that is in the earth beneath
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.880]   or that is in the water under the earth,
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.740]   you shall not bow down to them or serve them
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.980]   for the Lord your God is a jealous God.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.940]   In other words, God is so jealous
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.940]   for our direct personal dependence on him
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.780]   and reverence for him and adoration of him
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.340]   that he not only disapproves
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.940]   of competing so-called gods represented with idols,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.940]   but even the creation of idols presuming to represent him,
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.000]   not just false gods being turned into statues,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.500]   but himself being represented
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.700]   with some man-made object that we look to.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.300]   And I think if we ask why,
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.160]   that is why is he so jealous
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.740]   for that kind of direct personal dependence
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.980]   of reverence and adoration,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.100]   part of the answer is found in Psalm 96, five.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.160]   It goes like this, this is verse five of Psalm 96.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.080]   For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.380]   but the Lord made the heavens.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.220]   In other words, one of the problems with idols
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.240]   is that they contradict the transcendent nature
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.860]   of God as creator.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.500]   Any representation of God made with human hands
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.220]   leads to the misunderstanding of God's transcendence.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.820]   It gives the impression, if not the direct assertion,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.500]   that God is somehow in our power.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.780]   We can carve him or paint him or put him in our pocket
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.460]   or on our shelf or carry him on a cart.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.460]   And so the psalmist says, no, the Lord made the heavens.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.380]   In other words, he's absolutely transcendent.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.880]   You can't carve him or control him in any way.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   Another reason why God is so averse to images,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.340]   either of so-called gods or of his very self,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.220]   is found in, I think, Psalm 115, four through eight.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.020]   Goes like this, their idols are silver and gold,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.500]   the work of human hands.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.980]   They have mouths, but do not speak, eyes, but do not see.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.420]   They have ears, but do not hear, noses, but do not smell.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.740]   They have hands, but do not feel, feet, but do not walk.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.980]   And they do not make a sound in their throat.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.500]   And here comes the key verse.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.220]   Those who make them become like them.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.500]   So do all who trust in them.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.900]   In other words, not only do images
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.940]   misrepresent the nature of God,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.500]   they destroy the nature of man.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   They turn human beings into mindless, powerless clumps
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.060]   of unspiritual flesh.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.260]   We become like those statues.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.580]   The nothingness of idols turns human beings
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.060]   into nothingness.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.300]   So now we come to our friend's question.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.140]   Okay, if that's what the Bible treated as idols,
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.420]   today's idols, he says, are very different.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.180]   They seem to be desires of the heart,
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.100]   or for money, sex, power, things like that.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.200]   How did this come to be?
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.480]   Idols used to be statues, not just heart obsessions.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.180]   And I say, very good question.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.180]   How did that come to be?
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.140]   Here's the first thing I would say,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.140]   namely, that this change of focus in defining idolatry
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:58.200]   is owing to the fact that we live in the West,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.400]   in cultures where outright use of images
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.800]   for religious worship is less common
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.560]   than some other cultures.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.480]   So the question then arises,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.200]   well, do these biblical teachings about idolatry
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.960]   have any relevance for those of us who live in cultures
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.320]   where the use of statues,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.360]   before which people actually bow down and worship,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.880]   is less common?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.760]   Is there any relevance to it at all?
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.640]   The answer is yes.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.280]   And I don't think the use of the term idolatry
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   to refer to God demeaning love of money, sex, power
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.720]   is a misuse of the term idolatry
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.640]   when one presses in to the essence
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.560]   of what is really going on with an idol in the Bible.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.640]   Here are a couple of New Testament pointers
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.160]   in that direction to show why I think it's okay
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.800]   to use idolatry the way he says modern people
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.080]   tend to use it.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.240]   First, Romans 1, 21 to 23, refers to people
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.240]   who don't have direct knowledge of the gospel,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.600]   but they do have general revelation in nature
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.280]   so they can know God that way and be held responsible
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.960]   to glorify him and thank him.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.280]   Here's what it says.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.160]   For although they knew God,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160]   they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.640]   but they became futile in their thinking
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.360]   and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.240]   Claiming to be wise, they became fools
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.920]   and exchanged, this is the key part,
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.560]   resembling mortal man, birds, animals, creeping things.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:53.080]   Now, I think this text points to the essence
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   of the problem beneath the outward display of idolatry,
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.460]   namely, we exchange the glory of God for images.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:09.060]   And the first kind of image that Paul mentions
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.860]   is images resembling man.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.520]   And I don't think it would be a stretch to say
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   that the foremost image of man that threatens
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.000]   to replace God is the image we see in the mirror.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.920]   We are lovers of self-exaltation,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   which threatens continually our love of God exaltation.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.880]   I think it's right to call this exchange
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.460]   a form of idolatry.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.600]   So back to my broad definition, it went like this.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.200]   Anything that we come to rely on for some blessing
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   or help or guidance in the place of wholehearted reliance
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.360]   on the true and living God,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.200]   if we come to crave and love and depend upon
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.520]   and trust for a blessing, people's praise,
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.720]   to enhance our self-exaltation or money or power
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.240]   or sex or family or productivity or anything else
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.120]   besides God himself for the greatest blessing
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.000]   and help and guidance and satisfaction,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   then in essence, we are doing what idolatry has always done.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   Let me give you one more passage from 1 John 5, verse 21.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.080]   It's the very last verse of John's letter.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.160]   And it says this, "Little children,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.480]   keep yourselves from idols."
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   Why does John in his letter end that way?
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.060]   He had never even referred to idols in the whole book.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.300]   He never referred to idols in his whole gospel.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.640]   Out of the blue comes this closing sentence
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.960]   with the very word idol that ordinarily means a statue
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.640]   of something that we use to replace God with.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.820]   Don't give in to idols.
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.780]   Keep yourselves from idols.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.600]   So why did he end that way?
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.720]   Here's my closing suggestion.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.620]   He had said in chapter two, verse 15,
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.620]   "Do not love the world or the things in the world.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.040]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.840]   the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.140]   For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh,
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.940]   the desires of the eyes, the pride of life,
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.940]   is not from the Father, but is from the world."
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   Now, John the apostle may have had
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.080]   literal material images in mind when he said,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.420]   "Keep yourselves from idols."
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.380]   Maybe.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.180]   But I think he is also thinking
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.560]   of the more general deadly problem
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.460]   that anything in the world that successfully competes
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.660]   with our love for God is an idol.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.760]   So keep yourselves from idols.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   That is, love God and all that he is for us in Christ
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.340]   more than you love anything.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.180]   - Very good.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.380]   Yeah, that's a great definition.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.280]   An idol is, quote, "Anything that we come to rely on
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.400]   for some blessing or help or guidance
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.880]   in the place of a wholehearted reliance
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.960]   on the true and living God," end quote.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.800]   That's sharp.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.620]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.120]   Well, with the new year,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.720]   it's a good time to talk about new habits.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.000]   Specifically, how can God's word abide in me
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.880]   more deeply, more richly, more fully?
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.320]   Don't we all long for that,
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.520]   that God's word would abide in me more richly?
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.200]   Well, that's what we're gonna talk about next time.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.840]   and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.660]   See you then.
