[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Daniel writes in to ask, "How does Christian hedonism avoid making joy into
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.800]   an idol?" Well, the short answer is, Christian hedonism doesn't make a god or
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   an idol out of joy, because Christian hedonism says we make a god out of
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   whatever we find most joy in. That's the short answer. So find your greatest joy
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:48.920]   in God and thus be done with all idolatry. But his question is, how do you
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.200]   avoid making that mistake? It's not as though the mistake can't be made. In fact,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.040]   that would be my first statement about how to avoid it, is to say, admit it can
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.120]   happen. And I admit it can happen, not just because Daniel's asked me how not
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.920]   to let it happen, but because the Bible says it actually does happen in 2nd
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.640]   Timothy 3, where Paul says, "In the last days men will be lovers of pleasure
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   rather than lovers of God." Now when I read that, I say, "Really? That's amazing!
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.080]   The fallen human heart is capable of suicidal illusions." Because I call it an
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   illusion, because if you make pleasure the object of your love, it's like making
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.120]   love the object of your love. It's like making being pleased the object of being
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.800]   pleased. It's self-contradictory. It's self-defeating. My capacity, my
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.880]   faculty for delighting was made to delight in something. Delighting
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.440]   wasn't made to delight in delighting. Delighting was made to delight in
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.960]   something. If you delight in the delighting, you're like a hunter who
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.240]   aims to shoot his bullet. He's not going to get any deer that way. He's
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.360]   going to go hungry, which is why I said it's suicidal. It's an illusion.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.960]   And yet it's true. I mean, it's a good question. It's not a stupid question,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.120]   because Paul says men will be lovers of pleasure. Men will be so stupid and so
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.760]   insane and so drawn in on themselves, they will commit the suicidal hunting of
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.080]   trying to shoot the bullet in their gun. But here's another safeguard. I
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.240]   mean, we could talk about this all day, but let me just give you a few.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.480]   Christian hedonism says never merely pursue your joy. That's hedonism.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's not Christian hedonism. That's just hedonism. Christian hedonism says
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.960]   pursue your joy in God, or more precisely, pursue your joy in all that God is for
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.760]   you in Christ. And I say "is for you," not "does for you." In God, not through God.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.120]   God is the end of our quest. He's not a means. There's nothing more ultimate than
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.360]   God. So when we rejoice in his works, which the Bible says we should do, we are
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.640]   rejoicing in the God we see in his works and know through his works. We are
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.560]   receiving his works not as our substitute for God, but as a pointer to
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.720]   God. So the second caution or safeguard against turning pleasure or joy into an
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.480]   idol is to say that we always rejoice in God. Here's another one.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.360]   Christian hedonists explain that joy is a way of glorifying God. I mean, this is
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   the most fundamental thing, right? We say it desiring God. We exist to spread a
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.800]   passion for the supremacist God in all things for the joy of all peoples by
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.440]   highlighting the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.360]   satisfied in him. Everybody knows that you don't glorify yourself and you
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.160]   don't glorify pleasure when you take supreme pleasure in somebody. And I've
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.520]   told my rose story a hundred times, but I'll just give the conclusion of it here. So if
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:51.160]   I say to my wife, "There's nothing that would give me more satisfaction than to
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.720]   spend the evening with you tonight," she would never say to me, "You are so selfish.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.840]   All you ever think about is what will bring you satisfaction. That's why you
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   want to take me out tonight because I make you satisfied." She would never say
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:16.080]   that, because I am glorifying her satisfying qualities by telling her she
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.640]   makes me happy. And so when you come to worship on Sunday morning and you're
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.280]   driven by this by the sense of, "God, I'm here to spend time with you because
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.680]   there's nobody in all the world who can make me more happy," he's not gonna say to
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.120]   you, "You are so selfish coming to me." No, because we glorify him when he
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.360]   satisfies us. Here's another one. Here's another one. We insist, Christian
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.680]   hedonists insist on the truth that navel-gazing is bad hedonism. In other
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.760]   words, if you sit inâ€”if you go to an art gallery, you would want to enjoy the
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.680]   beauty of these masterpieces, and you stand in front of a Rembrandt, say, and
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:14.600]   you are constantly saying, "Okay, stomach, are you being turned? Okay, palms, are you
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.480]   beginning to sweat? Eyes, are you beginning to flutter? Pulse, are you
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.200]   starting? You're not gonna see anything. You gotta forget your pulse,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.280]   forget your stomach, forget your heart, and look at the painting!" Now some
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.880]   people have said, "Therefore, stop talking about pursuing joy and just talking
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.960]   about pursue God." Well, it's not that simple because there are ways to pursue
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.400]   God that don't honor him, and there are ways to pursue righteousness that don't
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.360]   honor righteousness. If you pursue God out of a mere sense of "ought," like,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.840]   "Okay, I ought to read my Bible, and I ought to go to church, and I ought to do this or
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.000]   that," God is not as honored as if you come to him as the object of your desire.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.040]   So I want to preserve both. Navel-gazing is bad hedonism, and we ought to pursue
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:22.320]   joy in the painting. We ought to want to be delighted by the painting. Let me
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.960]   give you one more, this short. I didn't see this early, Tony, say, what, 40 years
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.440]   ago, when I was first trying to formulate these things. We need, we Christian
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.800]   hedonists need to have a robust doctrine of self-denial and suffering, and so if
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   you look at my writings after the first edition of Desiring God, which
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.080]   came along, I've got a chapter on suffering in almost everything, and
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.320]   when people ask me, "How does this fit with self-denial?" I say, "Look, I totally
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.920]   believe in self-denial because Jesus said, 'Whoever would save his life will
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:10.680]   lose it.'" But C.S. Lewis taught me this in that same sermon where I saw almost
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.840]   everything else at the beginning. He said, "Whenever you hear a promise or a
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.640]   command in the Bible, it always comes with a reward, and God doesn't treat us
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.320]   because we're seeking our satisfaction, but because we're too easily satisfied
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.960]   because the rest of the verse says, 'Whoever would lose his life for my sake
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.240]   in the Gospels will save it.'" So clearly Jesus is arguing, "You want to save your
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.480]   life, don't you?" "Yes, I do." "I'm a hedonist." "Well, good. I want you to be. Now lose it."
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:49.400]   In other words, here's the way I would put it, "Deny yourself tin so you can have
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.960]   gold. Deny yourself brackish gutter water so you can have a mountain spring. Deny
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.800]   yourself hog gristle so you can have the finest steak." That's the
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.840]   point of a doctrine of self-denial. We must be willing to die, I mean really die,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:16.480]   because the steadfast love of the Lord, Psalm 63, is better than life. So maybe
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.360]   the sum of the matter is for Daniel, how does Christian hedonism keep joy from
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:30.680]   being an idol? Simply believe in the Bible and let the whole counsel of God
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:37.880]   inform your system. So I don't want to be more Christian hedonist than I am
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.640]   more biblical. Anytime somebody asks me a question where they see a part of the
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   Bible that doesn't seem to fit with Christian hedonism, I am on that. I am on
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.680]   that because I want to be biblical more than I want to be faithful to any system.
