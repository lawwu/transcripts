[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   what about mouthwashes yeah um i've never liked them um they feel they burn for one
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.540]   and then i learned some years ago and this is just kind of fun to cue to years ago it must have been
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.440]   like eight ten years ago i heard i think on the tim ferris podcast somebody said oh you know
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.320]   mouthwashes will nuke certain chemicals that are essential for cardiovascular function and
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.420]   so don't don't use them don't use mouth strips don't use any of that stuff and at that time that
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.420]   was considered like clear quote-unquote pseudoscience nobody like alternative science outrageous now we
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.300]   know this is actually true and this always you know this always um delights me and scares me at
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.620]   the same time that many of the things that right now people go oh that's pseudoscience i like creatine
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.060]   seems to be a big thing right now 10 years ago it was only the gym gym rats that we're talking about
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.800]   now everyone's like creatine creatine so uh what's the story on on mouthwashes and mouth strips and
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   mints and things of that sort that again like people just want to have fresh breath or at least they
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.220]   don't want to be the person with the bad breath sure yeah so listerine and those stronger rinses in
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.600]   in particular uh they generally contain alcohol astringents really strong antimicrobials you know
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.680]   it says kills 99.9 percent of germs well i think we've learned we're over disinfecting you know this
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.940]   is why asthma is up eczema allergies are up in our children we now are saying get into the dirt
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.600]   get you know get exposed to microbes and things um so we're carpet bombing the mouth what we've learned
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.960]   through the the data and you're right there are studies to show that chronic habitual use of these
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.540]   mouthwashes including prescription strength mouthwash like chlorhexidine is a common one
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.560]   it can damage the nitrate reducing bacteria so we have bacteria in the dorsum of our tongue specifically
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.760]   that is essentially your tongue that reduces nitrate to nitrite which is a precursor to nitric oxide
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.940]   nitric oxide is a molecule that is really important for cardiovascular health and vasodilation and
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.400]   immune health um so if we're indiscriminately carpet bombing the mouth with these really strong
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.000]   astringents and rinses we can be affecting our cardiovascular health and there are studies to
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.140]   show it can increase blood pressure and potentially cause cardiovascular issues so when i hear someone say
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.280]   but my breath is so bad you know i have to use this multiple times a day i immediately think well
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.040]   gosh why is your breath so bad it's normal to have bad breath after you eat a garlic you know garlic hummus
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.140]   or have a cup of coffee but if it's chronic halitosis or bad breath i'm curious do you have periodontal
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.840]   disease which is a chronic inflammatory issue in the mouth which can have a slew of downstream effects which we
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.700]   should discuss um in a bit um or do you have an infection it could be a sinus infection post nasal drip
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.200]   do you have tonsil stones or tonsillar infected infection like what else is going on in your mouth
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   where you feel you need this multiple times a day to even feel like you can present yourself in public
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.100]   um really strong essential oils and mints again i you'd be cautious with that every once in a while
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:42.960]   of throwing in a piece of gum or a mint of course it's really the habitual use of these things that can be damaging
