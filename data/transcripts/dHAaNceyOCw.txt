[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   We field some pretty huge questions on the podcast like this one from a woman named Abijah,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.600]   who's going through a lot.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.240]   "Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.360]   So I've been dealing with much in my life, which has been really hard for the past three
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.360]   years.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   Normally, I could face life's challenges with the assurance that God was in control and
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.880]   that I could trust him.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.560]   But beginning in 2018, I started to get really depressed about the whole meaning of life
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.480]   and my own life purpose.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.240]   It was in the midst of my challenges that I lost someone I really loved, and it broke
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.620]   me like nothing ever has.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.240]   My entire view of God and life has been shattered.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.120]   I can't seem to get myself out of wondering why life is even a thing.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.760]   Life, at least my life, often feels like it has no meaning.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700]   Can you renew my vision for life?
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.800]   Can you explain to me what is the meaning of life?"
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.360]   Abijah, I hear three distinct and interrelated sorrows that have brought you to this place
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.840]   of doubt about the meaning of your life.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.120]   I hear depression.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.680]   I hear loss.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.560]   I hear a kind of fixation in your mind.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.160]   You say, "I can't seem to get myself out of wondering why life is even a thing."
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.720]   In other words, the tape keeps playing over and over in your mind.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.040]   Is life really significant at all, or is it just a meaningless jumble coming from nowhere,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.240]   going nowhere, nothing in between but randomness?
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.680]   So I take your question, your plea, very seriously.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.000]   I have tasted a little bit of what you're talking about, and I know others who have
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.160]   tasted all of what you're talking about.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200]   I have seen myself come through.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.460]   I have seen others come through, and I believe you can come through.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.080]   You can come out into the light of confidence in God, confidence in Christ, confident in
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.600]   the certain purpose that God has for this world, the wise, good, just, holy purpose
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.840]   that God has for this world and your place in it.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.100]   Even in the words that you use, Subbiah, you put your finger on the meaning of life.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.440]   You say you are depressed about the whole meaning of your life and your own purpose.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   And I think that's right.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.240]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   That meaning consists in purpose, a good purpose, a wise, just, satisfying purpose or design
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.000]   for you, for the world.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.680]   So the whole question is, does the world, with all of its beauty and ugliness, gladness
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:12.480]   and groaning, love and hate, pleasure and pain, nobility and vulgarity, kindness and
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   abuse, selfishness and sacrifice, does such a world as ours have a wise, good, just, satisfying
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.120]   purpose under the providence of an all-wise, all-powerful God?
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.640]   Or was the atheist Bertrand Russell right at the end of his life when he said, "There
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.900]   is darkness without, and when I die there will be darkness within.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.880]   There is no splendor, no vastness anywhere, only triviality for a moment and then nothing"?
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.000]   Are the words of Macbeth in Shakespeare's play when he hears about his wife's death,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   are those words true?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.200]   Are they a reflection of reality?
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   When he said, "Out, out, brief candle!
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.640]   Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.480]   and then is heard no more.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.160]   It's a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:32.880]   Abijah, I think one of the common strategies of Satan, whom you know is a thief and a murderer,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   he steals truth from the mind, he kills the soul.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   One of his common strategies is to fixate our mind on such possibilities.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.720]   Life is a tale told by an idiot, isn't it?
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.320]   Full of sound and fury signifying nothing.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.360]   Satan doesn't even care if you believe that.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.680]   He just wants you to be fixated on it, to think about it all the time and wonder if
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.360]   it might be true.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:08.560]   He wants to steal from you and me every vestige of confidence that God is wise and good and
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.800]   just and holy and that God is working everything together for a great purpose.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:25.120]   So my purpose right now in this past Pastor John is to pray for you that you would have
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:34.520]   power to resist the devil and that I could put a sword, the sword of the Spirit, in your
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.960]   hand so that you could do battle valiantly and triumphantly against the darkness.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.400]   The sword of the Spirit, you know this, the sword of the Spirit is the Word of God.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.360]   God knew when he wrote his book, God knew that you would go through this.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.720]   God knew about your depression.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.440]   He knew about your loss.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.960]   He knew about the fixation of doubt in your mind.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.320]   And he wrote about these things over and over again in his Word to help you and all of us.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:15.840]   The meaning of life according to that Word, God's Word, is to know God as he really is
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:25.080]   and to enjoy him and all that he is for us in Christ and to reflect in this dark world
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.160]   some of the light that he has shown to us when Christ, the very Son of God, died in
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.120]   our place precisely that we might know God and enjoy God in spite of our sin and then
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.480]   one day see him and know him perfectly unendingly.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   Let me say it again.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:56.040]   The meaning of life is to know God and to enjoy God and reflect some of the beauty of
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:06.900]   God as we know him in Christ and one day see him perfectly and unendingly enjoy him.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:16.900]   The meaning of life now, the purpose of life in this age is not comfort in this world now
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:26.580]   nor escape from suffering now nor the avoidance of loss now nor the maximizing of physical
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:35.060]   pleasures now nor the amassing of riches now nor the achievement of any fame now nor the
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:43.260]   right to any health now nor that we would be treated with respect and justice now.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.940]   Those are not the meaning of life in this age for God's people.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.480]   Once sin entered the world and everything was corrupted and once God's saving purposes
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.720]   began to rescue people from sin, the glorious and beautiful purposes of this creation were
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:10.980]   thrust forward into the time when Christ would come again and set everything right, a time
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:18.100]   of perfect righteousness, a time of perfect peace, a new creation with no crying or pain
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:26.620]   anymore so that over and over again in the scriptures we are told to rejoice in hope
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.260]   like Romans 5 to rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:44.060]   This present world is primarily a season of testing and a refiner's fire.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.520]   If this world is all there is, then life is surely meaningless.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.700]   The Bible says, "Let's eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die if there's no resurrection
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.420]   from the dead."
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.420]   That's Corinthians 15.32.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:06.100]   So the apostle Paul said, "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:13.380]   worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us," in Romans 8.18.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:20.100]   And again he said, "This light momentary affliction," I'm thinking of your loss,
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:28.300]   Elijah, for example, "This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:35.340]   weight of glory beyond all comparison," 2 Corinthians 4.17.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.780]   And the apostle Peter put it most fully and clearly.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:47.660]   He said in chapter 1, verse 5, "By God's power you are being guarded through faith
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:58.260]   for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time, in this, this coming sure remedy
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:06.020]   for all ills, this salvation, in this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.940]   necessary, you have been grieved by various trials."
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.860]   Oh, Elijah, that's your life, right?
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:21.740]   That word "various trials" means all kinds of trials, literally many colors of trials
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.620]   and tests.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:31.900]   "So that the tested genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold, which though
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:37.940]   perishable is tested by fire, may result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.660]   of Jesus Christ."
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:45.260]   What an amazing interpretation of this world and our place in it.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:53.900]   The meaning of suffering in this life is the refinement of faith by the fires of various
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:02.180]   trials that we might know God, love God, show God as more precious than everything that
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.460]   the fires consume.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:15.540]   Jesus Christ suffered precisely to bring us through these fiery trials, refined and purified
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:22.060]   into the very presence of God for our eternal joy, 1 Peter 3.18.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.060]   So I close, Elijah, with an illustration.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:35.260]   When COVID-19 shut up my wife and me, someone gave us a puzzle with a thousand pieces.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.620]   They thought we would need something to do.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:44.700]   I spread it out on two card tables, and in the interludes between my work, I would just
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.620]   pause there and try to find a piece or two to put together.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:54.340]   I began with the confidence these thousand chaotic pieces piled in the middle of the
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:01.900]   table would one day be that beautiful picture on the box from bedlam to beauty, from chaos
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.900]   to order.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.900]   Yes, that's going to come.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.700]   I saw the picture on the box.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.060]   It was a kind of promise.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.020]   But one day I had the border almost entirely completed.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:19.020]   That's the way I started, do the board, almost entirely completed, everything fitting together,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.020]   but it wouldn't fit.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.620]   It was just one or two pieces that wouldn't fit.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.300]   And I was sure a piece was missing.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.100]   I looked all over the floor, or maybe they've made the puzzle wrong.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100]   It's defective.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.300]   And I went through time after time, systematically looking at all the pieces.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.340]   I put them in rows so I could see.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:44.240]   I became fixated on the fact this puzzle is not going to work.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.180]   This puzzle is defective.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:52.980]   Then my wife came over and she sat down and she looked at all the edge pieces that I had
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.460]   put together.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:00.980]   And she said, "I don't think these two pieces go together that you have fastened here.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.980]   They almost go together.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.980]   I don't think they go together."
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   I looked and said, "They're perfect.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   They go together."
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.080]   And she said, "No, I don't think so."
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:16.140]   And she took my puzzle apart and she uncoupled the pieces that I had spent hours finding
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:21.580]   and she rearranged the pieces and she put them back together and it fit.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.780]   Perfect.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.180]   There was no lost piece.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.180]   There was no defect.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.540]   It was just fallible me.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:37.060]   So my prayer is that this asbestogen would perhaps come to you the way my wife came to
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:45.140]   me and showed me, "Johnny, your fixation on the imperfection of this puzzle and that
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.780]   the makers blew it, that's out of place.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.660]   They really do fit.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.220]   This is going to be a beautiful picture.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.740]   Just keep at it.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.940]   Trust the promise that's on the box there."
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.180]   It's true.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:06.180]   The sufferings of this life are not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.180]   Great perspective.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.180]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.700]   Sobering situation, but God is sovereign good, and for his children he is doing eternally
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.700]   good things in all of our lives, even in the hardest of life situations.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.540]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that reminder.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.220]   We now break for the weekend, and next week we will begin with a very simple question,
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.260]   but a great one from a listener named Maxine.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.660]   Maxine wants to know, "Who wrote the Bible?"
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.140]   Who wrote the Bible?
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.620]   Man, some great questions of late coming into the inbox.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.700]   Pastor John will explain his answer to us on Monday.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.700]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.980]   Thanks for listening to the podcast, and we will see you then.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.700]   Have a great weekend.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.740]   [End of Audio]
