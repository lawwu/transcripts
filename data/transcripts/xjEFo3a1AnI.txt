[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.180]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.020]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.360]   Today, my guest is Dr. Chris Palmer.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.900]   Dr. Chris Palmer is a medical doctor specializing
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.440]   in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.860]   He is the world expert in the relationship
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.160]   between metabolic disorders and psychiatric disorders.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.300]   He treats a variety of different conditions,
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.920]   including psychosis, including schizophrenia,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680]   as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.780]   obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders,
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.160]   and depression, among others.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.620]   He is best known for understanding the relationship
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520]   between how metabolism and these various disorders
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.000]   of the mind interact.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   And indeed, today he describes not only
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.520]   his own fascinating journey into the field of psychiatry,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.760]   but also his clinical and research experience using diet,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.520]   that is, different forms of nutrition
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.440]   in order to treat various psychiatric disorders.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.200]   He describes some remarkable case studies
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.440]   of individuals and groups of people
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.380]   who have achieved tremendous relief
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.460]   from the types of psychiatric disorders
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.620]   that I just mentioned a few moments ago,
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.280]   as well as new and emerging themes
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280]   as to how metabolism and the mind interact
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.160]   to control things like obesity.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.320]   Indeed, he raises the hypothesis that perhaps obesity,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.840]   in many cases, is the consequence of a brain dysfunction
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.760]   as opposed to the consequence of a metabolic dysfunction
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.480]   that then impacts the brain.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.800]   During today's episode, he shares with us
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.900]   his overriding hypotheses about the critical roles
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.840]   that mitochondrial function and dysfunction
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.400]   play in mental health and mental illness,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.200]   and how various particular types of diets,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.640]   ranging from the ketogenic diet to modified ketogenic diet,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.720]   and even just slight adjustments in carbohydrate intake,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.420]   can be used in order to change mitochondrial function
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.440]   and bring relief for various psychiatric illnesses.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.600]   He also highlights the essential and important theme
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.800]   that various diet interventions,
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.660]   including the ketogenic diet,
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.000]   were not first developed for sake of weight loss,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200]   but rather were developed as treatments
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.520]   for neurologic conditions such as epilepsy.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.760]   Today, he shares with us how the foods that we eat
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.160]   alone end in combination, and how fasting,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.360]   both intermittent fasting and more lengthy fasts,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.000]   can interact with the way that our brain functions
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.720]   to strongly control the way that we think, feel, and behave.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.240]   What's wonderful is that Dr. Palmer
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.200]   not only explains the science and his clinical expertise,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.520]   but also points to various actionable measures
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.720]   that people can take in order to improve
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.840]   their mental health.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.320]   I'd like to mention that Dr. Palmer
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.740]   is also the author of a terrific new book.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.720]   The title is "Brain Energy, a Revolutionary Breakthrough
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.080]   "in Understanding Mental Health
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.840]   "and Improving Treatment for Anxiety, Depression,
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.620]   "OCD, PTSD, and More."
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.140]   I've read the book and it is a terrific read.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.920]   I came away from this book with a much evolved understanding
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.900]   of how the various psychiatric disorders
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.480]   that I just described, as well as ADHD, emerge in people.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.800]   And it has completely revised my understanding
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.640]   about the possible origins of various psychiatric disorders
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.400]   and the best ways to treat them,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.480]   including both with medications,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.100]   but also with nutritional approaches.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.280]   If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Palmer's work
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.200]   and the book, please go to chrispalmermd.com.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.080]   We also provide links to the book
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.280]   and to his website in our show note captions.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.800]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.720]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.560]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.620]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.960]   for the general public.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.740]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.960]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.160]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.960]   And as I've said many times before on this podcast,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.300]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.220]   because it means smart drugs.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.780]   And frankly, there are no specific neural circuits
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.840]   in the brain or body for being quote unquote smart.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.320]   Thesis understands this,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.400]   and they've developed custom nootropics
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.240]   that are designed to bring your brain and body
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.880]   into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.360]   They use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.320]   things like phosphatidylserine, alpha-GPC,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.920]   many ingredients that I've talked about before
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.580]   on this podcast and that I happen to use myself.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.360]   I've been using Thesis for over a year now,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   and I can confidently say
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.720]   that their nootropics have been a game changer.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.600]   For me, I like their nootropic for clarity.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.800]   I use that before cognitive work often,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.960]   and I like their nootropic for energy,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.520]   and I often use that before workouts,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.160]   in particular workouts that are especially intense.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.000]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.560]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,

[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.740]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.880]   to try in your first month.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.720]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.180]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.300]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.180]   I've talked many times on this podcast
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.460]   about the critical relationship
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.940]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.960]   That is, in order to fall asleep
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.320]   our body temperature needs to drop
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.240]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.860]   And conversely, when we wake up in the morning,
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.240]   that is in large part
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.720]   because of our body heating up by one to three degrees.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.660]   Now, people have different core body temperatures
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.280]   and they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.240]   Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   of your sleeping environment
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.160]   so that you have the optimal temperature
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.120]   that gets you the best night's sleep.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.000]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.120]   about eight months ago,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.480]   and it is completely transformed by sleep.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.340]   I sleep so much deeper.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.360]   I wake up far less during the middle of the night,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.200]   if at all,
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.660]   and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.960]   even after the same amount of sleep.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.800]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.040]   to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday bundle,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.400]   which includes their new pod three cover.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.680]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.300]   United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.020]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.640]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.920]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.960]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.840]   from Stanford,
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.460]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.480]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.240]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.160]   of the visual system,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.520]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.020]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.400]   in order for you to see clearly.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.120]   For instance, when you move from a sunny area
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.960]   to a shady area and back again,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.480]   whether or not you're looking at something up close
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   or off into the distance,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.880]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.160]   so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.120]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.600]   for activities such as running and cycling,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.120]   and indeed they are very lightweight.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.520]   Most of the time I can't even remember
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.560]   that they're on my face, they're so lightweight.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.640]   But the important thing to know about Roca eyeglasses
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.320]   and sunglasses is that while they can be used
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.960]   during sports activities,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.840]   they also have a terrific aesthetic
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.720]   and they can be used just as well for wearing to work
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.760]   or out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.200]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.800]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.960]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.800]   Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank you for being here.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.480]   - Thank you, Andrew, for having me.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.520]   - I have a lot of questions for you,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.080]   and I'm really excited about this topic
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.940]   because I think most people know what mental illness is,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.560]   or they have some idea what that is.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.460]   Most people have some idea what nutrition is.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.780]   Fewer people certainly know how closely
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.500]   those things can interact.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.300]   And I think everybody is familiar with the feeling
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.640]   of a food or the ingestion of a food,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.380]   making them feel good in the short term.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.100]   And we eat a food that tastes delicious to us
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.240]   or that we associate with something nice
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.180]   and we feel good mentally and physically.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.220]   Whereas when we eat something that gives us food poisoning
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.320]   or maybe even something that just doesn't taste that great
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.880]   or that we associate with a bad experience,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.900]   we feel less good in the short term.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.260]   But I believe that very few people understand
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.000]   or are familiar with the fact that nutrition
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.260]   and our mental health interact in this very intimate,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.700]   maybe even causal way.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.320]   And that is something that occurs
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.760]   over long periods of time.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.000]   Meaning what I ate yesterday, the day before,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.280]   maybe even 10 years ago could be impacting the way
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.240]   that my brain and body are making me feel now.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   So if you would, I'd love for you to just tell us
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.960]   about a little bit of the history,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.000]   in particular your history with exploring the relationship
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.680]   between nutrition and mental health.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.040]   And then we can dive into some of the more particulars
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.540]   of ketogenic diets versus other diets
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.960]   and some of the truly miraculous findings
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.920]   that you and others are coming up with
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.360]   based on real patients and real experiences of people
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.480]   who suffer and then find relief
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.280]   by altering their nutrition.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.120]   - Sure.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.840]   This story really starts with my own personal story.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.240]   And I don't need to go into great detail,
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.040]   but to set the stage, when I was a kid,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.520]   I definitely had mental illness.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.320]   Started with OCD, a series of events happened in my family.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.740]   My mother had a horrible kind of psychotic break
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.960]   and all sorts of adverse childhood events for me.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.840]   She and I were actually homeless together for a while.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.880]   I went on to have subsequent depression,
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.840]   suicidality, all sorts of things.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.040]   But somehow or another, I pulled myself together
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.800]   and got through medical school,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.100]   actually did quite well in medical school,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.480]   got an award for being one of the top students,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.320]   and then was doing my internship and residency at Harvard.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.820]   And at that point in time,
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.120]   I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.480]   So I had high blood pressure, horrible lipids,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.020]   and prediabetes.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.700]   And I was doing everything right, supposedly.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.520]   I was on a low-fat diet and I was exercising regularly.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.400]   And year after year,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   my doctor kept telling me diet and exercise.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.580]   I kept asking him what diet, what exercise.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.380]   I was doing everything he kept telling me to do.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.560]   Everything was getting worse.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.320]   My blood pressure kept going higher.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.420]   And at some point, he kind of said,
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.960]   you're gonna have to go on medication.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.120]   I need to put you on something for your prediabetes,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.380]   something for your cholesterol,
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.640]   and something for your blood pressure.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.880]   So three pills out of the gate.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.360]   And I'm like, I'm only in my 20s.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.400]   - Were you overweight?
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.640]   - No, technically no.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.600]   I had a gut, so that's a sign of insulin resistance.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.920]   I know now, I didn't know it then.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:10.560]   And he actually kind of leaned in at one point and said,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.160]   do your parents have diabetes?
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.280]   Yeah, do your parents have high blood pressure?
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.000]   Yeah, are your parents overweight?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.480]   Yeah, oh, I'm really sorry, it's genetic.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.400]   Basically, you're screwed.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.760]   It's your genes.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.600]   You're just gonna have to bite the bullet and take meds.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.920]   And as a physician, I knew what that meant.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.760]   I knew that I'm in my 20s.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.480]   If I'm already on three meds for metabolic syndrome,
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.280]   I'm gonna be screwed by the time I'm 40 or 50,
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.120]   and I'm probably gonna be having heart attacks.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.400]   And I'd heard through the rumor mill
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   that the Atkins diet could somehow help people
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.440]   improve their cholesterol and pre-diabetes.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.000]   I actually didn't really believe it.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.400]   I was highly skeptical.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.720]   And I believed everything I was taught in medical school.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   Why would my professors lie to me
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.280]   that they knew what they were talking about?
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.640]   Low-fat diet was the thing to do.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.280]   And the Atkins diet was clearly dangerous and reckless.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   And, but I had been trying the medical dogma for years
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   and it wasn't working for me.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.920]   And so for whatever reason,
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.320]   I decided this is gonna be my last attempt
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   at something different.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.840]   And then I'll just bite the bullet and go on meds.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.760]   So I tried the Atkins diet.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.600]   I did my own special version of it.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.080]   I still avoided red meat
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.040]   'cause I was terrified of red meat.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.760]   I tried to do a healthy version,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.600]   which it's probably more like the South Beach diet.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.360]   This was before the South Beach diet was invented.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.000]   But within three months,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.680]   my metabolic syndrome was completely gone.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.780]   - So blood pressure normalized, lipids normalized.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.880]   Did your weight change?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.800]   Or you mentioned that you were of healthy weight,
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.760]   but that you had a bit of abdominal fat.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.680]   - So I lost the abdominal fat.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.480]   I probably lost about 10 pounds through this process.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.160]   And, but everything got normal.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.720]   And when I went back to my doctor, he was shocked.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.760]   He actually said, "What the hell are you doing?"
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.480]   - During the time before you switched to this new diet,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.720]   how was your mental health, if you don't mind me asking?
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.080]   Because it sounded like you're very clear
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.880]   that there was metabolic syndrome
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.320]   or you were headed towards more severe metabolic syndrome.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.040]   You mentioned OCD.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.580]   I actually am familiar with this.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.260]   As a kid, I had a low level kind of Tourette's grunt
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.160]   and probably obsessive still to some extent,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.120]   although not full-blown clinically diagnosed OCD.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.500]   So I can relate somewhat if you're willing.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.460]   But what was the context of all that
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.100]   before and after this nutritional switch?
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.400]   - So before the nutritional switch,
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   I was still struggling with low-grade depression and OCD.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   I, again, it wasn't necessarily interfering
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.480]   with my ability to function
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.000]   'cause I was functioning at a high level.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.440]   I mean, anybody looking from the outside,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.360]   you're a top student.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.440]   You just got into one of the most competitive,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.280]   actually at that point,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.120]   it was the most competitive residency program
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.200]   in the country for psychiatry.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600]   So they would have looked at me and said, "You're fine."
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.440]   But I wasn't, I was actually on medications.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.880]   I was trying different medications, trying to figure out
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.920]   how to feel better, how to stop obsessing so much,
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.200]   how to not be so depressed.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.800]   And I found that those medications,
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.400]   they actually came with more side effects for me
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   than benefits.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.200]   I was on Prozac for a long time.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.640]   It totally messed up my sleep.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.840]   And then the psychiatrist was like,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.200]   "You need pills to help you sleep now."
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.000]   And I'm like, that's not really resonating very well with me
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.440]   and I'm now a psychiatrist, I'm in my psychiatry residency.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   And I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.160]   That's just not sitting well with me,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.400]   that you're gonna prescribe more and more meds
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.320]   for all the side effects that you're causing.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   And yet at the same time, I wanted to feel better.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.440]   And I was learning chemical imbalances.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.400]   This is what we do to get rid of depression and OCD.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.160]   You're supposed to take your pills and so on and so forth.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.920]   Take your pills and so I was taking my pills.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.320]   I was in psychotherapy.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.360]   I had been in psychotherapy on and off for years.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.720]   I had received much more intensive treatment
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.280]   when I was younger and that was essentially worthless for me.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.120]   It actually probably just caused harm at the end of the day.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.280]   - Psychoanalysis?
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.280]   - Various psychotherapies, not psychoanalysis per se,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.240]   but some of them were psychoanalytically oriented.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.720]   Psychotherapies, I was actually hospitalized at one point,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.440]   had been put on lithium and imipramine,
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.280]   which is a tricyclic antidepressant and other things.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.040]   And they were actually horrible.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.880]   They were horrible.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.480]   They did nothing beneficial for me.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.040]   I gave them a decent amount of time to work.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.960]   I really wanted to feel better.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.120]   So at the time that I tried this diet,
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.480]   I certainly wasn't impaired in the same way.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   I wasn't struggling that much,
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.040]   but I still have these low grade symptoms,
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.320]   was trying to feel better.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   And the thing that was the most striking to me
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.880]   after doing the diet for three months
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.760]   was not the fact that my metabolic syndrome was gone.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   That was my goal and it was a seemingly miraculous
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.320]   achievement because I got rid of everything
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.720]   with one dietary change.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   But the thing that I noticed was dramatic improvement
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.440]   in my mood, energy, concentration, and sleep.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.600]   For the first time in my life,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.360]   I started waking up before my alarm went off
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   and feeling rested.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.480]   That never happened to me before.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.160]   I was meticulous about planning when my alarm went off
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.680]   and how many times I could push the snooze button
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.240]   in order to be on time for wherever I needed to be,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.280]   whether it was school or the hospital or whatever.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.120]   I had a good system.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.360]   I was never late for anything,
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   but that was shocking to me that I felt so good.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.320]   And one of the things that I've often said to people,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   prior to the diet, I always felt like there are two types
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.480]   of people in the world.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.440]   There are haves and have nots.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.360]   There are these happy peppy people who just are so positive
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   and they've got energy and they have this saying,
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.960]   they like to work hard and play hard.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.040]   And I always understood working hard.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.200]   I totally got that 'cause I was a hard worker
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.160]   and I understood the value of hard work
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.120]   and that you gotta do something useful with yourself.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.520]   But I never understood who the hell wants to play hard?
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.240]   Like who's got energy for that?
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.800]   Like, aren't you tired from working so hard?
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.960]   How on earth do these people have energy
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.760]   to go and play hard?
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.080]   And I assumed that they were just part of the haves
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.960]   in the world and they were just lucky and privileged.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.240]   They either had good genetics
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   or maybe they had good childhoods or good parents
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.760]   or something, something that I didn't have.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.240]   - The kids with genuine smiles in the yearbooks.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.280]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.700]   - Whereas the rest, and by the way,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.420]   I really appreciate you sharing some of your personal story
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.160]   because I think it is very important for people to hear
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.380]   and understand that people like yourself
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.280]   who are extremely high functioning and accomplished,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.920]   that the road was, from everything I'm hearing
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.860]   and understanding, very choppy internally at times,
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.000]   and that you've overcome a lot in order to get there.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.940]   And also, I've been going through what sounds like
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.680]   a very long iterative process of trying to figure out
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.000]   what works and what doesn't work
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.200]   to finally arrive at a solution
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.180]   and then make that the basis of much of the work
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.880]   that you're doing today for other people.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.720]   I think it's very important because I think many people
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   share with you this notion that there are indeed two groups,
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.060]   a happy group and then fated to be unhappy group.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.240]   And it speaks to the fact that,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.640]   your story rather, speaks to the fact that
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.260]   what we see is not always what's going on internally
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.400]   with people and that this notion of there just being
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   two groups, the happy or the haves and the have nots,
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.080]   can't be the way that it works.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.440]   And there are probably many more people suffering
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.200]   than we realize, and that there is an important need
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.800]   for tools to overcome that suffering.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.600]   So I really just hear even early in our discussion,
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.400]   I just want to extend a genuine thanks
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.620]   because so much of what I hear from people is,
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.360]   questions about health and mental health
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.480]   and physical health, but that clearly point to the fact
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.280]   that many people are struggling to varying degrees.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.100]   And even the people who are in this category
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.340]   of great childhood and happiness could do far better
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.740]   for themselves and then also for other people.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.580]   So thank you for that.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.440]   I want to know at the point where you realized
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.260]   that nutrition can play a profound role in how you feel
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.120]   and operate in a large number of domains,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.260]   you were still a student or a resident at that point?
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.060]   - I was a resident.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.940]   - At that point, did you decide that you were going
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.140]   to explore this in a professional context?
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.980]   - Not yet.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.260]   - Okay, so what was the journey forward
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.340]   into the work that you're doing now?
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   - So the next step was that I just had friends and family
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.660]   who saw me, saw that I had improved my health,
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.220]   saw that I lost some weight pretty easily.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.160]   In particular, I remember like my sister and sister-in-law,
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.940]   they got really pissed at me one Thanksgiving
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.340]   because I could resist all the pumpkin pie
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.180]   and apple pie and everything else.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.900]   They were like, how the hell are you doing that?
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.620]   How are you resisting all of this food?
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.180]   I said, I don't crave it anymore.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.620]   I don't want it, I'm fine.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.900]   I'm just, I'm having turkey and green beans
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.500]   and that's good enough for me.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.600]   So I got them to do the diet
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.820]   and they too noticed dramatic improvement in their moods
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.120]   and energy and sleep and everything else.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.960]   So within a few years,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:01.040]   the primary thing I noticed
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.800]   is this powerful antidepressant effect.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   And now I'm, you know, an attending physician.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.200]   I've got all these patients in my clinical practice
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   with treatment resistant mental illness.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.280]   I'm in a tertiary care hospital.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.120]   So I almost never get somebody off the street
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.640]   with their first episode of depression.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.120]   Out of the gate as part of my career,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.440]   I get treatment resistant mental disorders.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.100]   So I get people who've already been
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.280]   to six plus psychiatrists, therapists.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.240]   They've usually tried dozens of different medications.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.800]   They've been in decades of psychotherapy.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.980]   They've often had ECT and other things
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.800]   and nothing's working.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.000]   And I'm thinking, you know, well,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.560]   we're kind of out of options for these other people
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.980]   and this diet is having this really powerful
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.840]   antidepressant effect.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.960]   I think I'm gonna try it
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.900]   and just see if any of my patients are game to try it,
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.560]   to see if it might help them.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.920]   Sure enough, it did.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.800]   Didn't help everyone and not everybody was interested
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.040]   and/or able to do it.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.140]   But some of the ones who were able to do it
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.160]   ended up having a remarkable
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.540]   and powerful antidepressant effect.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.880]   One woman actually became hypomanic within a month
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.400]   and she had been depressed pretty much nonstop
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.840]   for over five years, chronically depressed,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.800]   suicidal, in and out of hospitals.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.160]   And I saw her become hypomanic and I'm thinking, wow,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.080]   this really is a powerful antidepressant effect.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.600]   Like this is amazing.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.280]   This is like a medication,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.460]   but better because it actually is working for her.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.420]   But I laid low at that point,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.360]   because at that point we didn't have many clinical trials
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.280]   of the safety or efficacy of the Atkins diet
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.920]   for even weight loss or diabetes,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.880]   let alone any mental disorders.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.640]   And so I really actually felt like I'm on the fringe here
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.640]   and this is not going to be met with praise by anyone.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.800]   So I'm just going to lay low.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.280]   I'm going to offer it to patients.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   And I went along that way up until 2016.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.240]   - And may just ask about the diet.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   When you say Atkins diet, so this is low to zero starch.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.640]   So low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.200]   - Yeah.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.240]   - And was it traditional Atkins?
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.680]   Were you tailoring it to the individual patient,
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.920]   depending on their psychiatric symptoms,
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.800]   whether or not they were overweight or not overweight?
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.240]   I'm assuming you're not a nutritionist.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   So how did you prescribe a nutrition plan for your patients
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.760]   and what was involved in making sure
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.160]   that they adhered to that?
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.280]   Maybe even some of the things you observed in terms
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.480]   of who was more willing to try this or not try this.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.560]   Any observations or maybe even data.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.960]   - So early on I was winging it and I was, you know,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.140]   the first few patients, it was try this Atkins diet.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.400]   I want to see ketosis.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.920]   So I was going for ketones.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.160]   - So they were pricking their finger
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.420]   and they were doing a blood ketone test.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.120]   - I didn't know about blood ketone monitors
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.560]   if they existed back then.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.840]   So I was, we were using urine strips.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.500]   - Which are not quite as accurate,
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.160]   but still useful as a general guide from what I understand.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.000]   Is that right?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.080]   And so I was strongly recommending
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.160]   that patients achieve urinary ketosis.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.440]   And the interesting thing is I noticed a pattern
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.460]   that when they were trying the diet and not getting ketones,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.320]   they often did not get a clinical benefit.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.520]   It was once they got into ketosis
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.960]   that I began to notice the clinical benefit
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.080]   and the powerful antidepressant effect.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   So probably any nutrition plan, aka diet,
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.000]   that elevated ketones in the urine
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.540]   to the point where you would say this person is in ketosis,
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.560]   where they would say I'm in ketosis.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.860]   That was a step in the right direction,
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.420]   independent of like exactly what they were eating
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.120]   or not eating to get there, including fasting.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.280]   At that time, probably fasting wasn't as popular.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.720]   Now, thanks to the incredible work,
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.920]   I think it's incredible and he is a former colleague.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.000]   And I know there's a lot of controversy about fasting,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.160]   but I think for many people, fasting is a powerful tool.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.360]   For others, it's a less useful tool,
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.400]   but of Sachin Panda and others.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.000]   But fasting certainly will limit your carbohydrate intake
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.720]   and get you into ketosis, correct?
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.560]   - It will.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.000]   - Did you have any patients fast
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.380]   or do intermittent fasting?
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.960]   - I did.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.120]   So, and I had some patients
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.880]   who did what Atkins had called a fat fast,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.660]   where they eat primarily fat.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.020]   So they either fast and/or they eat primarily fats
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.080]   to try to get into a state of ketosis.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.960]   So for some patients,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.080]   it was actually quite easy to get into ketosis,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.600]   especially overweight and obese patients.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.520]   They have a lot of fat stores on their body
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.080]   and actually limiting carbohydrates usually results
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.720]   in high levels of ketosis for them.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.560]   - And they probably feel better too, I imagine,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.280]   because when we limit our starch intake,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.680]   we start to excrete a lot of water.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.180]   People can get some pretty quick weight loss
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.120]   that even though it may not be fat loss,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.140]   makes them feel literally a little lighter
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.600]   and maybe a little more energetic.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.140]   Is that right? - Absolutely.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.760]   And as the years went on,
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.340]   the field was advancing, more research was coming out.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.260]   People were getting a little more sophisticated
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.640]   with blood ketone monitoring, with different versions
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   of ketogenic diets, and I was evolving my practice.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:58.400]   The thing that completely upended everything
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.280]   that I knew as a psychiatrist though
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.720]   was when I helped a patient in 2016 lose weight.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.160]   So this was a patient, 33-year-old man
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.300]   with schizoaffective disorder.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.040]   He had been my patient for eight years now.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.820]   Could you clarify for people with schizoaffective disorders?
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.300]   I'm not a clinician, but as I recall,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.100]   it's like a low level of schizophrenia.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.100]   So there might be some auditory hallucinations.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.580]   If I met this person, I might think they're kind of different
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.300]   quote unquote weird, but they would not seem necessarily
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   at the scary to me and typically to other people.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.000]   And I mean that with respect, of course,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.700]   but oftentimes people with schizophrenia can seem
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.200]   just like you don't even know how to interact with them
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.900]   because their world seems so altered
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.180]   because they have all these so-called positive symptoms,
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.080]   hallucinations, and they're talking to people
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.420]   that no one else can see, et cetera.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.500]   Is that schizoaffective?
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.660]   - So no, actually.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.560]   So schizoaffective is the same as schizophrenia, essentially.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.620]   The only difference is it's schizophrenia
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.800]   with superimposed mood episodes.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.700]   - Oh, so it's actually more severe than-
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.560]   - It can be.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.880]   - Okay, so I have it backwards.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.440]   - So schizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.960]   plus some mood episodes.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.840]   - Maybe I'm thinking of schizotypal.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.520]   - Schizotypal is the low grade kind of mild paranoia
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.880]   or kind of eccentric beliefs and other things.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.640]   - Okay, so folks out there,
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.080]   I have my nomenclature backwards.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.000]   Schizotypal is the quote unquote low level schizophrenia
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.400]   or schizoid-like.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.000]   Schizoaffective is as or more-
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.560]   - Full blown schizophrenia plus full blown,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.800]   usually bipolar symptoms.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.920]   - And now it's absolutely clear
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.240]   who the clinician in the room is.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   Thank you for that reminder.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.060]   - No worries.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.600]   So this man had schizoaffective disorder.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.640]   He had daily auditory hallucinations.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.800]   He had paranoid delusions.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.900]   He could not go out in public without being terrified.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:02.400]   He was convinced that there were these powerful families,
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.160]   that they had technologies that could control his thoughts.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.560]   They could broadcast his thoughts to other people.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   They were trying to hurt him.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.200]   They had targeted him for some reason.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.640]   He wasn't quite sure why.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.560]   He had some suspicions and beliefs about
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.680]   maybe when he did this bad thing when he was 11 years old,
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.040]   that's why they decided to target him.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.760]   This man was tormented by his illness.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.280]   Tormented, it ruined his life.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.040]   He had already tried 17 different medications
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.480]   and none of them stopped his symptoms,
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.360]   but they did cause him to gain a lot of weight.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.840]   - These are the medications, as I recall,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   for schizophrenia that classical ones
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.100]   are dopamine receptor blockers,
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.520]   cause people to huge increases in prolactin.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.840]   That's why sometimes men will get breast development
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.280]   and they'll put on a lot of weight
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.520]   and they'll be catatonic or movement disorders.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.960]   They make you feel like,
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.600]   I have to imagine given how good
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.640]   most things that release dopamine make us feel
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.840]   that blocking dopamine receptors with antipsychotics
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.960]   makes people feel lousy.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.280]   - Horrible.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.880]   And it's a huge challenge in our field
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.440]   because a lot of patients don't want to take them.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.060]   And then you get these rebound effects.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.240]   If patients are on them for several months
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.040]   and then they stop them cold turkey,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.780]   they can get wildly psychotic and ill,
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.800]   end up aggressive or hospitalized or sometimes dead.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   So that's him, he weighs 340 pounds.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.320]   And for whatever reason, he gets it in his head,
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   I'm never gonna get a girlfriend if I don't lose some weight.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.380]   He also recognizes I'm never gonna get a girlfriend
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.520]   cause I'm a loser, I'm schizophrenic,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.240]   I live with my father, I have nothing going for me,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.560]   but I could at least try to address
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.260]   one of these awful, horrible things about myself
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.100]   and maybe I could lose some weight.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.360]   So he asked for my help.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.620]   For a variety of reasons, we ended up deciding
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.700]   to try the ketogenic diet.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.280]   Now at this point, I have no anticipation
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.400]   that the ketogenic diet is gonna do anything
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.600]   for his psychiatric symptoms.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.540]   Because this man has schizoaffective disorder,
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.000]   that's not depression.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.540]   Depression is very different,
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.340]   they're totally different disorders.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:24.500]   So he decides to give it a try.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.800]   Within two weeks, not only does he start losing weight,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.280]   but I begin to notice this dramatic antidepressant effect.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.360]   He's making better eye contact, he's smiling more,
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.300]   he's talking a lot more.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.820]   I'm thinking like, what's gotten into you?
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.640]   Like you're coming to life,
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.040]   I've never heard you talk this much,
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   I've never seen you so excited or present or alive.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.120]   I haven't changed his meds at all.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.360]   The thing that upended everything
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.600]   that I knew as a psychiatrist was six to eight weeks in,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.820]   he spontaneously starts reporting,
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.840]   you know those voices that I hear all the time?
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.020]   They're going away.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.960]   And he says, you know how I always thought
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.240]   that there were all these families
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.920]   who were controlling my thoughts and out to get me
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.100]   and they had targeted me?
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.320]   And I'm thinking, oh yeah,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.620]   we've been talking about that for eight years,
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.440]   we can talk about that again.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.880]   He says, you know what?
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.360]   Now that I think about it, I don't think that's true.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.280]   And now that I say it, it sounds kind of crazy.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.100]   It probably never was.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.660]   I've probably had schizophrenia all along
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.660]   like everybody's been trying to tell me.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.680]   And I think it's going away.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.600]   That man went on, he's now lost 160 pounds
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.080]   and kept it off to this day.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.400]   - Wow.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.600]   - He was able to do things he had not been able to do
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.220]   since the time of his diagnosis.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.760]   He was able to complete a certificate program.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.060]   He was able to go out in public and not be paranoid.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.660]   He performed improv in front of a live audience.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.900]   At one point, he was able to move out of his father's home
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.560]   and live independently.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.560]   And that completely blew my mind as a psychiatrist.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:18.660]   And I went on a scientific journey to understand
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.800]   what in the hell just happened.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.100]   - That is indeed mind blowing.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.620]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.520]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.980]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.340]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.240]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.920]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.140]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.740]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.820]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.800]   once or usually twice a day
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.720]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.400]   that I need for gut health.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.060]   Our gut is very important, it's populated by gut microbiota
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.820]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.220]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.860]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.720]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.540]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.100]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.020]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.900]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.360]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.800]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.200]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.180]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.500]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.780]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.080]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.480]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.160]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.540]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.480]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.080]   - I have a couple of questions.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.840]   First of all, did he stay on any kind of antipsychotic
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.140]   or other medication?
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.920]   If so, were the dosages adjusted, excuse me,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.280]   while undergoing this remarkable transition?
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.900]   Because as we know, it's not an either/or medication
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.760]   or nutrition changes, it can be both.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.120]   And then the other question is one of adherence.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.720]   I think about someone with schizoaffective disorder
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.320]   who's suffering from all the sorts of things
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.280]   that you described.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.460]   How does somebody like that organize themselves
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.200]   in order to stay on a ketogenic diet?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.880]   And I say this with all the seriousness in the world.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.680]   I think there are a lot of people who do not have
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.460]   schizotype or schizoaffective disorder who have trouble,
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.460]   they claim, adhering to a ketogenic diet.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.760]   It's not the easiest diet, certainly in its extreme form.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.060]   At first, it's not the easiest diet to stick to.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.380]   So how did he do it?
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.900]   This sounds like a remarkable individual.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.320]   And I'd also like to just know your general thoughts
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.700]   about adherence to things when people are back
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.040]   on their heels mentally, how do they get motivated
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.640]   and stick to something?
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.080]   So the questions were medication, yes or no.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.440]   If yes, dosage adjusted, yes or no.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.300]   And if people are suffering from depression
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   or full-blown psychotic episodes,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.480]   how does one ensure that they continue to adhere to a diet?
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   - So in terms of medications, he has remained on medication.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.660]   So early on, I wasn't adjusting anything.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.260]   I was just in disbelief and shocked that this was happening.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.840]   I didn't know what was going on.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.740]   Over the years, we have slowly but surely
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.940]   tried to taper him off his meds.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.100]   He has been on meds for decades.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.660]   He started medications when he was a young child.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.660]   His brain has developed in response
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:46.300]   to all sorts of psychiatric medications.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.400]   And it has not been easy to try to get him off.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.740]   So we continue to try to get him off medication
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.980]   and it's challenging and difficult.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.580]   And I just wanna say for any listeners,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.280]   it is getting off your meds is very difficult and dangerous
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.740]   and you need to do it with supervision,
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.940]   with a mental health professional or a prescriber
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.180]   because it is dangerous.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.520]   When people reduce their meds too much,
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.540]   they can get wildly symptomatic.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.600]   - Is that true for depression as well?
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.620]   - It's true for any psychiatric medication.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.540]   The brain makes adaptations
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.140]   in response to psychiatric medications.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   And when you stop them cold turkey, some people are fine,
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.740]   but I wouldn't recommend finding out
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.560]   because I've seen patients when they stop antidepressants,
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:44.140]   I've seen patients get floridly depressed and suicidal
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.140]   within three months.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.780]   I had one patient almost quit her job
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.540]   because she became convinced that,
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.120]   well, my life sucks and it's all because of my boss.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.020]   And I know that she's just a horrible human being
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.220]   and she's abusing me.
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.260]   And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.620]   I think this is related to your medication change.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.740]   We got her back on her meds within three days.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.140]   She said, oh my God, I can't believe that happened.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.660]   Like I almost quit my job.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.300]   And that would have been the most illogical
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.140]   and irrational decision I've ever made in my entire life.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:25.060]   But somehow it seemed so real just several days ago.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.860]   And now that I'm back on this medication,
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.740]   and it doesn't mean that she needs the meds,
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.860]   but it doesn't mean that he needs the meds.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.980]   It means that meds need to be adjusted very safely
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.860]   and cautiously and gradually.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.300]   So that's the medication piece.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.500]   The adherence piece was not easy for him
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.960]   and for other patients.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.860]   It is very rare that I have a patient
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.060]   who I can say, do the ketogenic diet,
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.280]   come see me in three months and let me know how it's going.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.140]   That almost never happens.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.620]   It has happened, I think on two occasions.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.900]   But that is, if I understand correctly,
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.500]   what perhaps not you,
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.720]   but many psychiatrists do with medication.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.460]   It's here's your prescription.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.260]   Let's talk in a month or three months.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.380]   - Yes.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.720]   - So that's a variable that is probably worth us
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.460]   exploring a little bit here as the conversation continues.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.300]   - Absolutely.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.500]   - You know, that frequent contact
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.940]   and making micro adjustments or macro adjustments
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.340]   to medication or nutrition could be meaningful.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.380]   - Absolutely.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.940]   So with this particular patient,
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.120]   early on he was actually pretty adherent.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.740]   I was seeing him once a week.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.300]   And so I could do a lot of education.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.580]   I was weighing him.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.220]   I was checking his ketones.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.620]   I was checking his glucose levels.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.980]   At that point I had a blood ketone monitor in my office.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   So I knew whether he was compliant or not,
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.000]   which is so beneficial in doing clinical work
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.740]   and research on this diet.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.700]   It's the only diet where within seconds
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.340]   I can have an objective biomarker
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.340]   of compliance or non-compliance.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.500]   - Such a key point.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.960]   And again, brings to mind for me
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.660]   the parallel with medication.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.120]   I mean, a patient can say they're taking their medication
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.340]   and unless they're in a hospital setting
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.800]   where somebody is checking under their tongue
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.780]   and you know, all of this,
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.920]   they very well could not be taking it or taking more.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.740]   And you and I both know that blood draws
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.300]   for neurotransmitter levels are complicated
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.480]   because you want to know what's in the brain
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.040]   and what's functional in the brain.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.500]   So, and I would have to imagine
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.420]   that most people that are prescribed drugs
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.380]   for any number of different psychiatric conditions
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.980]   are not giving blood every time they talk
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.620]   to their psychiatrist or psychologist.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.940]   - No, no.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.580]   And when we looked at, you know, on that front,
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.460]   when we've looked at studies of compliance,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.460]   the majority of patients are at least somewhat non-compliant
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.060]   with prescription medications.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.300]   It's not on purpose.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.420]   It's, they forgot.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.660]   They take it at night.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.580]   They were out late.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.180]   They were off their routine.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.460]   They forgot to brush their teeth
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.300]   because that's when they take their meds.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.360]   And so, because they, you know, it was so late,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.060]   they just crashed when they got home.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.980]   They forgot to take their meds.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.660]   Happens all the time.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.520]   If it's a medication that people take more than once a day,
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.500]   the non-compliance rates are much higher
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.580]   because it's just easy to forget.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.800]   So it's not that people are willfully, you know,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.060]   disobeying their doctors or anything else.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.820]   It's just hard to remember to take meds
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.420]   consistently every day.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.380]   - When you say measuring ketones,
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.900]   I want to drill into this a little bit
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.060]   because it does seem that the presence of ketones
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.340]   and somebody being quote unquote in ketosis
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.460]   turns out to be the key variable.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.620]   Certainly in your book, that's what I,
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.220]   one of the major takeaways,
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.180]   although there were many important takeaways,
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.620]   that people get into ketosis.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.660]   Do they have to stay in ketosis?
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.740]   So for instance, I've followed the,
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.900]   I don't any longer, but I've tried in the past,
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.600]   the so-called cyclic ketogenic diet,
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.220]   where every third or fourth day,
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.620]   get some pasta or rice, et cetera.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.280]   And that was interesting as an experiment,
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.680]   but to stay in ketosis,
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.020]   what sort of blood levels of ketones
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.300]   do you like to see in your patients?
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.760]   What is the range that you think most people could aspire to?
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.980]   - So it really depends on the patient
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.460]   and what I'm treating, quite honestly.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.820]   So, and I don't think every patient
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.420]   needs the ketogenic diet.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.680]   For some patients, simply getting rid of junk food
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.740]   can make a huge difference in a mood disorder, for instance.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.180]   - So a junk food, meaning highly processed food,
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.420]   food that could last on the shelf a very long time.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.380]   - Highly processed foods that are usually high
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:54.380]   in both sugar, carbohydrate, carbs, and fats.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:58.100]   Those seem to be the worst foods.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.580]   That combination, high sugar, high fat,
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:06.380]   seems to be the worst combination for metabolic health.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.500]   And lo and behold, we've got emerging data
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.860]   that suggests, that strongly suggests
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.980]   it's also bad for mental health.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.460]   Depression and anxiety are the most common
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.960]   mental disorders, and so we have the best data
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.800]   for those disorders, but we actually have a lot of data
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.380]   with even bipolar disorder and schizophrenia
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.260]   that insulin resistance in particular,
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.940]   and insulin signaling in the brain is impaired
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.220]   in people with chronic mental disorders,
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.980]   kind of across the board.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.760]   All the way from chronic anxiety, depression,
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.560]   to bipolar, to schizophrenia, and even Alzheimer's disease.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.300]   We know that patients with all of those disorders
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.340]   have impaired glucose metabolism,
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.380]   and that the insulin signaling system in the brain,
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.460]   which is different than insulin signaling in the periphery,
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.900]   seems to somehow possibly be playing a role.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.920]   So to step back from that, so for some patients,
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.300]   I might just wanna decrease glucose and insulin levels,
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.500]   and I can do that by getting rid of sweets.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.780]   For other patients, like patients
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.900]   with schizoaffective disorder, or schizophrenia,
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.620]   or bipolar disorder, especially if it's chronic,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.360]   if I'm using it as a brain treatment,
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.340]   then I do want a ketogenic diet,
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.500]   and I usually want reasonably high levels of blood ketones.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.940]   Usually, for depression, I wanna see at least greater
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.340]   than probably 0.8 millimole.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:44.340]   For psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder,
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.900]   I usually wanna see levels greater than 1.5.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.600]   That's what I'm shooting for, if at all possible.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:57.860]   And so, yeah, I think that's what I'd go for.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:02.300]   - Yeah, so, and sorry, I didn't mean to imply
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.340]   that people need to be in ketosis
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.960]   in order to see some mental health benefits
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.300]   from changing their diet.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.060]   You make very clear in your book,
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.580]   and we'll go into this in more detail,
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.740]   that avoiding insulin resistance,
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.460]   reversing insulin resistance,
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.820]   and essentially trying to reverse
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.120]   what earlier described as this metabolic syndrome,
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.940]   which is a bunch of different things, is the target.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.360]   And for some people, getting rid of highly processed foods
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.420]   and focusing mainly on non-processed
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.540]   or minimally processed foods will really help.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.720]   For others, going straight to the full-blown ketogenic diet
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.980]   will be of most benefit.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.700]   I'd like to back up a little bit in history
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.860]   and get to something which I find incredibly interesting,
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.940]   which is epilepsy and the longstanding use
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.980]   of ketogenic diet and fasting to treat epilepsy.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.480]   And the reason I want to kind of rewind
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.080]   to that point in history is that I think that
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.360]   for a lot of listeners and people out there
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.060]   who are familiar with how changing your diet
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.140]   or changing your exercise can positively impact sleep
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.280]   and weight and all these things,
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.660]   and it cascades into feeling better.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.340]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.240]   But for a lot of the world still,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.860]   the idea that changing or using nutrition
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:29.360]   as a dissection tool or as a treatment tool
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.820]   to understand and treat mental illness
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.120]   is still a kind of heretical idea.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.860]   That to them, it kind of falls in the,
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.600]   okay, well, that's like woo science or something like that.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.220]   Now, obviously you're a board-certified physician
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.980]   or psychiatrist at arguably one of the finest
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.020]   medical schools in the world, Harvard Medical School.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.820]   You know, even though I'm on the Stanford side,
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.680]   we acknowledge our East Coast friends.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.460]   - You're the Harvard of the West Coast.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.460]   - We're not going to talk, we're not going to talk--
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.320]   - Or we're the Stanford of the East Coast.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.540]   - That argument could go back and forth a number of times.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.220]   But you know, this is, you're a serious clinician
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:09.100]   and a serious scientist and you're a serious thinker.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.080]   But for a lot of people out there,
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.440]   the notion of using diet, they immediately think,
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.120]   ah, well, that makes perfect sense.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.380]   Or I think there's a category of people who think,
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.860]   well, yeah, didn't Atkins die of a heart attack?
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.480]   You know, I hear that a lot, you know?
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.260]   So like, that was crazy.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.580]   You know, like people immediately discard the Atkins diet
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.900]   for that reason, which I do think is throwing the baby out
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.820]   with the bathwater, but it's an interesting thing nonetheless.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.340]   And then I think that the majority of people
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:41.100]   sit in the middle and just want to see science and medicine
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.840]   come up with treatments that work.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.800]   And I have to say, I'm very relieved
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.320]   to hear what you said earlier, which was,
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.500]   you never said that people should come off their medication
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.020]   and just become, go on a ketogenic diet
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.020]   and everything will be cured.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.300]   You're certainly not saying that.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.720]   And rather you're saying, if I understand correctly,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.720]   that nutrition needs to be considered one of the major tools
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.140]   in the landscape of effective tools,
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.580]   and that it can be very effective,
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.500]   evidenced by the story that you shared.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.180]   And there are many other stories in there as well,
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.140]   of truly miraculous transformations.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:19.180]   So let's talk about epilepsy and how the ketogenic diet
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.580]   is not just used for epilepsy, but is one of the oldest,
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.940]   if not the oldest examples of the use of nutrition
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.260]   to treat a condition of the nervous system
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.900]   that can be incredibly debilitating, even deadly.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.300]   - Yeah, and the reality is that this literature
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.900]   and this clinical history and all of the research we have
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.540]   was the godsend that I needed
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.740]   to do the work that I'm doing.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.500]   Otherwise I would have been discredited on day one.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.260]   Chris Palmer's claiming that a dietary change
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.500]   can influence schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.140]   that's impossible, and he's a quack.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.640]   But the thing that immediately got me credibility
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.700]   was I didn't focus on it as a diet.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.460]   I did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.340]   So the ketogenic diet, unbeknownst to most people,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:19.340]   was actually developed 100 years ago, 1921,
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.300]   by a physician for one and only one purpose,
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.140]   to treat epilepsy.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   It wasn't developed as a weight loss diet.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.520]   It wasn't developed as the diet
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.620]   that all human beings should follow.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.020]   And the reason it was developed
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:38.460]   is because of this longstanding observation
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.760]   since the time of Hippocrates
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.780]   that fasting can stop seizures.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:48.580]   Now fasting is not a healthy diet.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.340]   Fasting is the process of no diet.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:57.240]   So we now understand a tremendous amount of science.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.120]   Most people think going without food is bad,
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.140]   and they equate it with starvation.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.540]   But in fact, when we go without food,
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.340]   it causes tremendous shifts in metabolism,
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.300]   both brain and body metabolism.
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.940]   And it puts the body into a mode of autophagy
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:21.500]   and conservation of resources and all sorts of things
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.420]   that are beneficial to human health.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.380]   And this is why fasting has been used
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.820]   as a therapeutic intervention in almost every culture
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.760]   and almost every religion for millennia.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.600]   But for the most part,
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.120]   that was all thought to be religious folklore.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.600]   That was just crazy talk.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.000]   And those stupid people way back then
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.460]   thought God cured everything.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.740]   And so they fasted and they just assumed
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.740]   that they were getting better.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   Well, in 1921, one physician used intermittent fasting
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:58.960]   on a child with seizures and found that,
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.260]   oh, lo and behold, this religious folklore stuff
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.100]   has something to it.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.060]   It actually worked.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.420]   The problem with fasting is that you can only fast
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.160]   for so long before you starve to death,
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.520]   and that's not a very effective treatment.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.860]   - And this child was ingesting water, correct?
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.700]   - Yes.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.780]   - It was just food elimination fasting.
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.100]   - Food elimination.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.740]   So no special diet.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.740]   So it was, but the problem with fasting for epilepsy
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.460]   is that as soon as people start eating a normal diet again,
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.840]   their seizures usually come right back.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.780]   Oftentimes with a vengeance.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.220]   And so it can be a good short-term intervention.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.400]   The fasting can take a few days
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.660]   'cause it can take a few days to get ketosis.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.360]   And then you can get some relief from chronic seizures,
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.660]   but it's not a good long-term treatment
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.160]   because again, people will starve to death.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.680]   As soon as they start eating, seizures come back.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.560]   So it was actually Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.500]   who developed the ketogenic diet
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.300]   with one and only one purpose.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.300]   He wanted to see, can we mimic the fasting state
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.720]   using this special diet
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.740]   to see if it might stop seizures long-term?
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.780]   And lo and behold, it worked.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.660]   Early results were extraordinarily positive.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.560]   50% of patients who use the ketogenic diet
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.340]   became seizure-free,
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.780]   and another 35% have a 50% or greater reduction
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.540]   in their seizure frequency.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.980]   So about 85% efficacy rate.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.820]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.220]   I didn't mean to do that there.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.380]   Was it just for pediatric epilepsy
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.900]   or for adult epilepsy as well?
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.460]   - So back in the 1920s,
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.300]   we didn't have many anti-epilepsy treatments
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.260]   and a lot of adults were struggling as well.
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.120]   So they were using it on anybody who would do the diet.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:52.460]   By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals were coming out
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.200]   and we had many more anti-convulsant treatments.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.860]   And there's no question they work for a lot of people.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.900]   That's great.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.580]   And taking a pill is so much easier than doing this diet.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.620]   So the diet pretty much fell out of favor
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:10.260]   and nobody was using it from the 1950s to about the '70s.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.500]   But lo and behold, even to this day,
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.180]   people with epilepsy, about 30% don't respond
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.860]   to the current treatments that we have available.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.480]   30% will have treatment-resistant epilepsy,
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.600]   which means they continue to have seizures
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.420]   no matter how many anti-convulsants they're taking.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.460]   Even if they've had brain surgery,
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.340]   it just doesn't stop their seizures.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.600]   And so in the 1970s, the ketogenic diet was resurrected
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.060]   at Johns Hopkins for these treatment-resistant cases.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.220]   And lo and behold, it works.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.420]   Not for all of them, but it works.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:48.420]   And about 1/3 become seizure-free.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.480]   And these are people who've tried everything
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.380]   and nothing's working.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.340]   So 1/3 becomes seizure-free.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.740]   Another 1/3 get a clinical benefit,
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.600]   meaning a 50% or greater reduction
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.180]   in their seizure frequency.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.980]   And the other 1/3, it doesn't seem to work.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.660]   It's not always clear if that's because of noncompliance
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:07.320]   or if that's because the diet's just not working,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.040]   but about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.380]   Seizure freedom, reduction in seizures,
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.720]   or it just doesn't work.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.900]   And so the reality, the godsend for me
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.860]   is that we have decades of neuroscience research
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.020]   on the ketogenic diet and what it is doing to the brain.
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.620]   We know that the ketogenic diet
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.180]   is influencing neurotransmitter levels,
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.540]   in particular glutamate, GABA, adenosine.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.780]   It changes calcium channel regulation and calcium levels,
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.340]   which is really important in the function of cells.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.540]   It changes gene expression.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.260]   It reduces brain inflammation.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.100]   It changes the gut microbiome.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.940]   And there are, you know,
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.880]   gut microbiome's a huge topic right now.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.380]   And there are some researchers who argue
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.020]   that is the primary benefit of the ketogenic diet.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:57.140]   It's changing the gut microbiome in beneficial ways.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.820]   So it's doing a lot of things.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.300]   It obviously improves insulin resistance,
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.260]   lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels,
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.260]   which improves insulin signaling.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:14.660]   The key for my research that I've outlined,
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:19.780]   the real magic is that this diet
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.900]   stimulates two processes that relate to mitochondria.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.820]   It stimulates a process called mitophagy,
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:30.140]   which is getting rid of old and defective mitochondria
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.260]   and replacing them with new ones.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.840]   And it also stimulates a process
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.380]   called mitochondrial biogenesis,
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.060]   which means that after people have done the ketogenic diet
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.260]   for a while, months or years,
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:47.100]   many of their cells in their bodies and brains
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.860]   will have more mitochondria and those mitochondria
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.880]   will be healthier.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.360]   And I believe that is the reason the ketogenic diet
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:00.960]   is such a powerful treatment, not only for epilepsy,
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.100]   but also for people with chronic mental disorders.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:09.860]   - Would you mind listing off a few of the mental disorders?
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.740]   And I know this is not meant to be inside ball,
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.180]   but we should distinguish between psychiatric disorders
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.540]   and neurological symptoms and diseases.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.380]   You know, the fields of psychiatry and neurology,
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.940]   hopefully someday will just merge.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:28.140]   But for instance, typically if somebody is presenting
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.220]   with something that looks like Alzheimer's, dementia,
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.500]   they'll talk to a neurologist.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.620]   Whereas if somebody is presenting with symptoms
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.120]   like schizophrenia, bipolar, they'll talk to a psychiatrist.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.680]   But if you wouldn't mind wearing a dual hat,
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.880]   could you just quickly list off some of the neurologic
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.780]   and psychiatric disorders for which ketogenic,
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.760]   or let's just say nutrition changes have been shown
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.720]   to improve symptoms significantly?
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.640]   And then maybe we can dive into a couple of these
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.920]   as well as get more deeply into these two
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.380]   very interesting aspects of mitochondrial function
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.820]   and repair and turnover.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.700]   - Yeah, so the field, you know,
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.460]   in terms of nutritional psychiatry, it's a broad field
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.200]   and it's in its infancy is the real answer.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.400]   If you're looking for randomized controlled trials,
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.500]   documenting efficacy in large numbers of patients
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.780]   with these disorders, we don't have them.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:25.040]   They're underway now, but we don't have them yet.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.940]   What we do have are case studies.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:33.940]   We have a lot of mechanistic science papers
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.300]   by some of the leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.780]   in the world and neurologists in the world,
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.940]   kind of outlining this is everything we know
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.840]   that the ketogenic diet's doing.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.580]   These are the problems in the brains of people
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:50.640]   with these chronic mental or neurological disorders,
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.560]   so we know that they should work.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.980]   But the disorders range from chronic depression
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:01.980]   to we've got a trial underway for PTSD.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:08.420]   We've got one actually decent pilot trial
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:11.040]   from the National Institutes of Health
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.660]   for the ketogenic diet for alcohol use disorder
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.720]   of all things, and we can go into that a little more.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.760]   We've got a couple of pilot trials of the ketogenic diet
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.800]   for Alzheimer's disease.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.960]   We've got, and those are randomized controlled trials.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.180]   We've got case studies of the ketogenic diet
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.520]   for chronic depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.240]   The largest study that we've got
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:40.240]   in that mental health sphere is a pilot study
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.400]   of 31 patients admitted to a French hospital.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:49.880]   The 28 of those patients were able to do the diet
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.720]   and stay on the diet.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:57.260]   So 10% off the bat, non-compliant, couldn't do the diet,
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.920]   so we need to include that.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.020]   But of the 28 patients who were able to do,
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.180]   and these are 28 patients
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.180]   with treatment-resistant mental disorders,
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.520]   chronic depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.720]   Of the patients who were able to do the ketogenic diet,
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.480]   100% had at least some improvement in symptoms.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.340]   46% had remission of illness.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.760]   Remission of illness, that does not happen
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.540]   with current treatments.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   And 64%, I think, were discharged on less medicine
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   than they went into the hospital on.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.820]   So it wasn't that the people were prescribing more medicine,
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.060]   and that's why they were being discharged
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.620]   on less medication.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.300]   We've got at least, again,
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.580]   a lot of the hardcore scientists are gonna say,
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.840]   show us the randomized controlled trials
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.980]   with hundreds of patients.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.140]   And we've got five randomized controlled trials
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:57.380]   underway now, funded primarily through philanthropy.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:03.400]   I can tell you that we've talked
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.220]   about that one index patient,
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.800]   but at this point, I have now treated dozens of patients,
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.740]   and I've heard from hundreds of patients
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.320]   who've been treated by other clinicians, researchers,
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.140]   or I've just heard from patients from around the world
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.580]   who have shared stories of complete remission
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:27.300]   of long, chronic mental disorders,
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.060]   like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia,
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.020]   off of psychiatric meds, some of them, not all of them,
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.460]   but some of them are able to get off all psychiatric meds
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.700]   and remain in remission.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:44.140]   Again, I think I didn't say this before,
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.620]   but it's really important to mention.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.940]   For people who might be unfamiliar
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.260]   with the mental health field
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.340]   and its connection with epilepsy,
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.900]   the reason that it's such an important connection
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.900]   is that we use epilepsy treatments
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.220]   in psychiatric patients every day
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.320]   in tens of millions of people.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.120]   So a lot of people don't know this,
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.680]   but I'll list off some names
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.800]   that a lot of your listeners may have heard of,
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.060]   and they probably know them as psychiatric drugs,
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.320]   but in fact, these are epilepsy drugs,
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.360]   Depakote, Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax,
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.120]   Neurontin or Gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.520]   Those are all medications that stop seizures,
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.520]   and many of them were developed initially for seizures,
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.800]   but we in the mental health field quickly steal them
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.000]   and start using them in tens of millions of people,
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.760]   even if they're off-label.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.140]   So that means we don't have research studies
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.960]   documenting that they're effective,
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.440]   but we go ahead and use them anyway
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.920]   because the reality is far too many patients
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.680]   aren't getting better with the FDA-approved treatments
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.360]   that we do have to offer.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.440]   So psychiatrists are just winging it in some cases,
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.120]   and we're just throwing whatever we can at them,
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.240]   and we absolutely include epilepsy treatments.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.960]   So in many ways, using the ketogenic diet
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.160]   as a treatment for serious mental disorders
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.080]   is nothing new at all.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.280]   It's an established evidence-based treatment for epilepsy.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.120]   We use evidence-based treatments for epilepsy
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.920]   across the board for a wide range of mental disorders,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.000]   and so in many ways,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.200]   that's all I'm doing with the ketogenic diet.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.700]   It just happens to be a diet.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.040]   - I love it.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.480]   I love it, and I should say I love it
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.040]   because we had a guest on here early days of the podcast.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.800]   He's a colleague of mine at Stanford.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.140]   He's a bioengineer and a psychiatrist,
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:42.000]   phenomenal scientist and psychiatrist called Diceroth,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.700]   who won the Lasker Prize and so on and so forth,
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.120]   and he made a really important point,
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.720]   which should have been obvious to me,
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.360]   but wasn't until he said it,
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.720]   which was the psychiatrist has tools
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.120]   just like the surgeon has tools,
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.240]   but the tools are language and observing behavior.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.560]   Those are the dissection tools
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.760]   for what's going on in someone's brain,
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.000]   and then as a neuroscientist,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.320]   I'm familiar with the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators,
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.220]   and you mentioned that,
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:17.440]   and there are these tools of altering brain chemistry,
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.120]   which are of the sorts of drugs you just listed off
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.260]   or antidepressants or antipsychotics
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.480]   that fall into these major bins of adjusting dopamine
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.520]   or adjusting serotonin or some combination of dopamine,
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.800]   serotonin, epinephrine, adenosine, and on and on and on,
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.600]   and it seems to me it's an incredible field,
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.440]   but that the field is still very much in its infancy,
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.640]   that it wasn't but 100 years ago
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.520]   that people were measuring bumps on the head
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.400]   as a way to diagnose phrenology
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.960]   and that there's still so much to learn,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.920]   and so when I hear you say adjusting nutrition
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.620]   or putting people into a ketogenic state
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.760]   or even just eliminating highly processed foods, sugars, et cetera,
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.080]   taking care of metabolic syndrome
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.560]   and then observing tremendous relief
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.940]   in clinical syndromes or symptoms, rather,
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.280]   of psychiatric disorders, it makes perfect sense to me.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.460]   It's yet another dissection tool
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.360]   and a tool for altering brain chemistry.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.800]   I think that if I think about the landscape,
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.900]   the sort of sociology out there of,
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.100]   again, it seemed to be these bins,
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.000]   like a third of people saying,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.080]   "Of course, diet and exercise and social connection
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.660]   "and limiting stress, that's the good stuff.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.340]   "That's the stuff that we know really works."
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.180]   And then about a third of people are sort of unclear,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.140]   and then a third of people think,
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.840]   "Well, if it's not a prescription drug,
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.480]   "then it just has no place in medicine."
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.640]   And hopefully that's changing.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.940]   And certainly the work that you're doing
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:41.480]   is going to be important in that transition
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.540]   that I think we will see.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.980]   I'd like to talk about mitophagy
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.980]   and mitochondrial biogenesis.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.540]   I think most people learn that the mitochondria
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.620]   are the energy factories of cells,
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.100]   and that indeed they are.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.780]   As a neuroscientist, what I know about them
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.740]   is that they are present everywhere in neurons,
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.500]   not just in the so-called cell body,
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.140]   but you can find mitochondria
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.460]   in the furthest little bits of neurons,
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.500]   and neurons can be quite big, very large, in fact,
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.000]   meters long or more in some cases,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.820]   and some species, including us,
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.020]   depending on how tall somebody is.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.660]   It could be many meters, or several meters, rather.
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:21.820]   And then mitochondria do a lot of stuff
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.780]   besides just produce energy.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.620]   'Cause I think people hear mitochondria, energy,
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.560]   and they think, "Oh, so these patients felt better.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.020]   "They lost weight, they have more energy,
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.060]   "and then they're doing better."
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.180]   But here we're talking about remission
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:37.180]   of auditory hallucinations, people feeling suicidal,
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.080]   and then changing their diet,
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.220]   and feeling like life is something they can deal with,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.500]   and maybe even function extremely well, and et cetera.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.260]   So maybe we could just talk about mitochondria for a moment,
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.140]   and then talk about these two major effects.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.480]   What are some of the other things
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.900]   that mitochondria are important for in neurons,
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.940]   and maybe other cells of the brain?
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.540]   Because as an access point for all this,
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.420]   I think it would be great
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.140]   if people could learn a little mitochondria biology.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.140]   - Yeah, no, so I guess the first thing that I'll say
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:12.140]   is that this field is one of the most cutting edge fields
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.300]   in medicine right now.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:19.500]   20 years ago or so, I think the majority
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.940]   of research scientists thought of mitochondria
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.020]   as nothing more than little batteries.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:29.180]   They take food and oxygen and turn it into ATP,
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.420]   and that's really important.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.740]   Yeah, we get that, but they're just little batteries.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   That's all they are.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:39.220]   And so one of the reasons that this
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:44.140]   work is so important is because it combines
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.580]   cutting edge research in the metabolic field
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.180]   and the aging field, and we can start to pair it
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.780]   with the mental health and neurological health field.
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:08:00.780]   So mitochondria, one scientist gave me this analogy.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.980]   He said, "If you think of the cell as a computer,
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.260]   "a lot of people think of mitochondria as the power cord
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.620]   "to that computer, 'cause they're providing the power,
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.500]   "and they are, in fact, the power cord to that computer,
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.020]   "but actually their real function
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.660]   "is the motherboard of that computer."
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:23.500]   So mitochondria are directing and allocating resources
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.460]   throughout a cell.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.660]   That is their primary function,
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.380]   and then they happen to be powerhouses as well.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:33.100]   And so to give some clear examples,
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.860]   mitochondria play a direct role in the production
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.340]   and release and regulation of some really key
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.780]   neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine,
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.340]   glutamate, acetylcholine.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:51.260]   Those are pretty powerful neurotransmitters.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.500]   - Yeah, I would consider those the,
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.660]   I know you listed more than three,
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.860]   but the sort of primary colors of neurotransmission.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.700]   - Yes.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:00.540]   - Any one of those,
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:04.460]   in excess or deficiency is going to have profound
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.500]   negative effects on a nervous system,
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.820]   or it's going to alter the way that people and animals
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.820]   feel, think, move, remember, et cetera.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.900]   - And so as part,
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.340]   so mitochondria are providing both some of the building
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:21.420]   blocks, if you will, for some of those molecules.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.780]   They're part of the Krebs citric acid cycle.
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.340]   Some of the intermediate products actually go
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:31.060]   into making those neurotransmitters, much more importantly,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.140]   mitochondria provide the energy for the production
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.260]   of those neurotransmitters and fascinatingly,
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.580]   mitochondria are directly related to the release
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:45.300]   of neurotransmitters, ATP alone is not enough.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.500]   There've been some research studies that have actually found
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   that mitochondria move along the membrane of the synapse
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   to release batches of vesicles of neurotransmitters.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.420]   And that if the mitochondria are removed from the synapse
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:08.420]   and researchers flood that cell with ATP,
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.980]   neurotransmitters usually are not getting released.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.820]   Mitochondria are doing other things.
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:18.100]   We don't entirely even understand what all they're doing
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.540]   or how they're doing it,
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.140]   but they're doing other things that they're not doing.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.060]   They're doing other things than just providing the power.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.060]   Another really important example is that mitochondria
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:35.940]   are actually the primary regulators of epigenetics.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.500]   If you look at any one factor, so one study actually found
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.940]   that they're responsible for the expression
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:46.740]   of about 60% of the genes in a cell.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:51.380]   And so, and mitochondria do this through a lot of ways
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.700]   known for years and sometimes decades.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.580]   So mitochondria are directly related to the levels
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:59.780]   of reactive oxygen species in a cell.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:04.540]   They are managing calcium regulation in cells.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.740]   And we know that those things play a role
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.340]   in epigenetic expression.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:13.340]   We know the levels of ATP to ADP or AMP also play a role.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.020]   And mitochondria are doing those things.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.620]   But it turns out mitochondria are actually doing
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.220]   much more sophisticated things than even those
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.900]   in terms of gene expression.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:27.500]   Mitochondria at least play a role in all of the aspects
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.220]   of the human stress response.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.020]   So when humans are stressed either physically
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:38.020]   or psychologically, there are several things that happen.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:43.740]   Increased cortisol, increased adrenaline, noradrenaline,
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.940]   inflammation, and gene expression in particular
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:50.980]   in the hippocampus occur with the stress response.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.380]   And one group of researchers actually genetically
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.900]   modified mitochondria in four different ways
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.300]   and found that all of the stress response,
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:03.100]   all those four buckets of stress response were impacted
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:07.140]   in one way or another, implying that mitochondria
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:11.140]   are somehow playing a role in those.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:14.060]   In terms of their role in cortisol,
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.820]   we know that mitochondria actually have the enzyme required
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.660]   for the synthesis of steroid hormones.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.100]   So that includes cortisol, estrogen, testosterone,
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.780]   and progesterone, some names that maybe everybody's heard of.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:33.780]   And so that means that if mitochondria are in short supply
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:39.620]   or dysfunctional, the production of those hormones
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.900]   may become dysregulated.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:48.340]   Mitochondria play a direct role in inflammation,
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:53.340]   and they turn the inflammatory system both on,
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.980]   or they at least play a role in turning
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.780]   the inflammatory system both on and off.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.380]   I think I'm not gonna be able to quote
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.940]   the exact study and author, but one paper in Cell
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.780]   actually identified mitochondria as the key regulator
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.900]   in turning certain inflammatory cells off.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.260]   And that when you inhibit mitochondrial function,
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.540]   those cells don't turn off.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.620]   Mitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:22.620]   are a key signaling process
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:26.220]   to turn the inflammatory cell process off.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.860]   Another study found that macrophages,
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.180]   so macrophages are an important immune cell
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.500]   that play a role in healing.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:38.380]   So if you cut yourself, your body will send inflammation
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.300]   that way and send immune cells that way
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.580]   to try to heal your skin.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:48.100]   And macrophages play an important role in that healing.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.580]   One group of researchers tried to figure out
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.780]   how do macrophages know to switch
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.620]   between the different phases of wound healing?
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.060]   'Cause the macrophages do different things
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.940]   in the different phases of wound healing.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.700]   And the conclusion of all of their research
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.260]   was that it's mitochondria.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:10.300]   Mitochondria are sending the essential signals
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.260]   that change the state of the macrophages
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.060]   to induce these different phases of wound healing.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:22.060]   So I've just talked about neurotransmitters, hormones,
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.580]   epigenetic expression, inflammation.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.060]   For anybody familiar with the mental health field,
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:36.300]   they know these are like some of the key variables
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:40.100]   that researchers have been struggling with for decades
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.980]   trying to figure out how do these fit together?
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   We know that all of those buckets can be disrupted
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.580]   in people with mental disorders.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.820]   And our field has struggled to understand
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.820]   but how do they fit together?
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:00.660]   How can we make sense of this disruption?
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.540]   And I believe once you understand
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:07.020]   the science of mitochondria,
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.620]   you can actually connect all of the dots
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.500]   of the mental illness puzzle.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.140]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.220]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.700]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.220]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.860]   to help you better understand your body
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.700]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.360]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.780]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.800]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.380]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.460]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:40.000]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.540]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.280]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.060]   Inside Tracker solves that problem
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.380]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.400]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.260]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.400]   you might want to take on
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.980]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.780]   hormones, lipids, and other things
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.740]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.760]   to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.620]   and indeed optimal for you.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.020]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.060]   - Super interesting little sub-cellular goodies
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.800]   these mitochondria are.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:33.500]   I come from a field where people are often divided
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.260]   into lumpers and splitters,
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.540]   and I'm somewhere in between.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.860]   For those of you who don't know,
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.220]   lumpers are people that like to make things really simple,
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.500]   lists of no more than three functions
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.760]   or dividing brain areas into no more than three splitters
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.740]   are people that like to subdivide into a ton of detail.
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.800]   There's a history of scientists being splitters
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.900]   in order to be able to name things after themselves
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.860]   because there's more territory to go around
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.980]   if you're splitting than if you're lumping.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.460]   But we are doing neither here.
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:06.700]   What I'm hearing is that mitochondria,
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.700]   in addition to being important sources
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.580]   of energy production and output in cells,
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:16.340]   which of course they are, probably have other roles
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.420]   and that maybe someday what we call mitochondria
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.380]   will actually be two or three different
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.780]   little sub-cellular organelles.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:24.920]   There may be little bits in there
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.100]   that are controlling gene expression
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.980]   and little bits in there that are controlling
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.740]   neurotransmitter production.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:32.220]   At least for now, the name is mitochondria
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.500]   and thank you, by the way, for illustrating
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.940]   some of the other things that they do
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.020]   because in the landscape of science education,
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.900]   oftentimes people think, okay, energy production,
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.620]   there'll be a picture or a cartoon of mitochondria
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.980]   like flexing its muscles.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.580]   People go, okay, energy, mitochondria, mighty mitochondria
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.740]   and then they'll think, oh, you know,
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.060]   they're just sort of like a dumb jock portion of the cell.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.020]   They're not doing anything sophisticated
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.580]   and everything you listed off is that they are doing
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:01.140]   many sophisticated, intricate things within cells.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.820]   So I think how things are cartooned and discussed
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:06.700]   actually has an impact and not just on the general public,
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.260]   but on the medical field and on the science fields.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.180]   Anyway, that's more science sociology.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.220]   But now that everyone is well aware
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.500]   that mitochondria are doing a large number
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:20.700]   of very important things in a very regulated way,
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.100]   let's talk about mitophagy.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:22.980]   You know, a few years ago,
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.300]   because a Nobel Prize was given for autophagy,
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.620]   sometimes called autophagy, look, people,
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:29.580]   you can say it either way.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.300]   People will know, hopefully what it means is more important,
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.300]   which is the gobbling up of one's own cells
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.340]   that are dead or injured.
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:43.860]   And this idea of autophagy, of cells being eaten up
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:48.400]   or within a system, nervous system or other system,
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.060]   has come up again and again.
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.900]   I actually wasn't aware that mitophagy
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.780]   could be such an important lever.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.060]   So tell us about mitophagy, which I have to presume
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:02.060]   is the intentional, or not, gobbling up of mitochondria,
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.600]   presumably to replace them
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.660]   with newer, healthier mitochondria, is that right?
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:07.500]   - It is.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:12.020]   So in many ways, mitophagy is a subset of autophagy,
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.260]   but it's got its own name
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:18.220]   because it is specific to mitochondria.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:23.220]   There do appear to be some unique regulators of mitophagy
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.300]   compared to autophagy more broadly.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:31.800]   Mitochondria actually are playing a role in autophagy itself.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.820]   And this makes sense because one of,
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:38.560]   so the global picture of autophagy is stimulated
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   by fasting states or fasting-mimicking states.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.600]   So when your body senses that you don't have enough food,
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.600]   it actually hunkers down and starts to recycle
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.620]   dead old parts in this kind of carefully orchestrated way.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:06.160]   And it takes them to lysosomes, they get degraded,
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.100]   and then those degradation products get used
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.420]   for either energy or to build new things.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:17.500]   Autophagy is always occurring at a low level,
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.680]   but you can really hyper-stimulate the process
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.140]   through fasting, calorie restriction,
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.640]   fasting-mimicking diets, other things.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   And this is why fasting and calorie restriction
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.480]   is so kind of such hot topics in the medical field now
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.060]   is because they've been shown to induce longevity,
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.200]   and we think it's probably through that process
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.200]   that you're stimulating the body to kind of become lean
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.080]   and conservative in terms of its allocation of resources.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.620]   And the body doesn't just destroy the healthiest tissue
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.280]   along with the old dead stuff.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.800]   It has these processes that identify
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.100]   the old and defective parts first, and they go first,
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.480]   and that's what's beautiful about the whole thing,
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.520]   and that's why fasting is so important.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.520]   So mitophagy we know plays a really important role
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:20.880]   because so there's this term called mitochondrial dysfunction
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.200]   which some researchers are actually wanting to get rid of
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.840]   and move away from because as you just said,
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.040]   mitochondria do so many different things,
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.520]   and different mitochondria even within the same cell
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.720]   may very well be specializing in different tasks,
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.520]   and mitochondria from one cell to another
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.880]   are sometimes doing very different things.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.080]   Like not all mitochondria can produce cortisol.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.420]   That's specific to specific cells.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.660]   Where those genes are getting turned on.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.380]   So it's not like all mitochondria are producing cortisol.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:54.460]   Just the ones in your adrenal gland, for instance,
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.060]   are producing cortisol.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.940]   But there is this term mitochondrial dysfunction,
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:05.620]   and it has long been known for decades
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:09.260]   that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.660]   with everything that ails us essentially.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:18.660]   So in the 1950s we had a theory of aging
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:25.220]   that was based on reactive oxygen species,
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.340]   and that essentially,
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.540]   and that's where all the inflammation is bad for you
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.380]   comes from.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:34.380]   - And where all the noise about antioxidants.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.720]   - Yes.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.180]   - Like in the 90s it was like it contains antioxidants.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.760]   Not to say antioxidants are bad,
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.220]   but they are certainly not the be all end all of health.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.260]   - They are not, but that's exactly
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.860]   where that research came from.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.460]   Is that researchers were narrowing in
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:50.620]   on these reactive oxygen species
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:55.520]   are highly, highly correlated with all of the diseases
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.740]   of aging and poor health outcomes.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.720]   Turns out they're also highly, highly correlated
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.660]   with all chronic mental disorders, interestingly.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:09.900]   And so researchers used antioxidants to see if,
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.860]   well maybe if we can stop, somehow tame
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.280]   these reactive oxygen species,
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.580]   we'll improve health outcomes.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.980]   Doesn't seem to work.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.360]   By the 1970s our understanding of mitochondria
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.540]   and their role in the production
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.840]   of reactive oxygen species expanded,
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.100]   and that led to the mitochondrial theory of aging.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.440]   So in the 1970s we had this mitochondrial theory of aging,
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.220]   based primarily and exclusively on reactive oxygen species.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.360]   Fast forward a couple of decades,
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.160]   that was disproven because we now know reactive oxygen
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.680]   species aren't all bad.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.960]   They actually serve a signaling process.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.280]   They're a normal part of human functioning
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.000]   and cellular function.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.760]   So they're not all bad, but we still know high levels
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.220]   of reactive oxygen species are bad for you.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:59.400]   Fast forward to just, I think maybe last year,
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.000]   with this expanded role of all of the different things
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.660]   mitochondria are doing.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.420]   So David Sinclair published a paper
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.380]   in one of the Cell journals, I think,
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:14.380]   saying that oh, mitochondria are actually the unifying link
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:17.220]   of everything that we know about aging.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:21.220]   Mitochondria are the cause, or defective mitochondria,
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.640]   or defective mitochondrial function,
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.540]   mitochondrial dysfunction,
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:30.020]   is possibly the unifying cause of aging
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.800]   and all of the aging-related disorders.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.640]   So mitophagy is trying to address all that,
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.720]   is trying to say, okay, this is bad.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.700]   We don't want defective mitochondria,
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:46.580]   and how can we get rid of old ones or defective ones
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.460]   and replace them with new ones?
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:54.460]   And I think the most powerful signal and tool
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:25:01.100]   that we have right now is in fact related to diet.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.480]   It's calorie restriction.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.480]   That is the oldest, truest, kind of best-proven way
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:15.040]   to prevent aging in a wide variety of animal species.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.100]   Fasting and intermittent fasting,
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.920]   and again, you can only do those things for so long,
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.280]   and then fasting-mimicking diets
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:29.060]   can also stimulate this process of mitophagy.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.700]   Before we talk about mitochondrial biogenesis,
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:36.520]   if, and I certainly accept the idea
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.500]   that mitochondria are extremely important
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.340]   in physical health and mental health.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:44.880]   That's, for me, is a straightforward conclusion
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.800]   at this point, based on what you've said,
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.940]   what I've read elsewhere, et cetera.
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:54.680]   And if various diets, including ketogenic diet,
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.200]   including fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera,
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.800]   can assist in mitochondrial function and mitophagy,
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.100]   and that's at least one of the levers
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.480]   by which diet can positively impact mental health
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.420]   and physical health, can we conclude
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.980]   that there's something special
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:16.420]   about low blood glucose in the brain, right?
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.260]   I mean, the sort of common pathway of all of those things,
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:22.400]   fasting, ketogenesis, for some people,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.180]   maybe some people have great insulin management,
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.700]   so just removing sweets, you know, refined sugars,
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.260]   you know, brings down their blood glucose levels
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.340]   substantially, they don't need to go on a ketogenic diet
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.100]   in order to relieve a low-level depression
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.140]   or something like that.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.420]   It seems like the common theme here
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:43.900]   is that glucose levels in the brain need to be reduced,
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:48.900]   which for me is surprising because neurons love glucose.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:51.780]   I mean, there are some really nice studies,
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.580]   one that I can think of recently
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.540]   that was published in Neurons.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:56.240]   If you just look at the tuning of a neuron,
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.820]   how well a neuron in the brain
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.980]   represents some visual image in the environment
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.620]   in terms of, here we can just generalize
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.420]   in saying more action potentials,
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.960]   more electrical signals from the neuron
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.840]   generally correlates with better,
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.580]   high-fidelity representation.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.600]   It's like sort of, you know,
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.780]   if every time someone says shout
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.900]   and then someone shouts, the neuron is like
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.900]   the one responding to the order,
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.100]   and these neurons, just when there's high glucose,
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.440]   they are faithful representatives
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.380]   of what's out there in the world.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.300]   But then when you fast an animal,
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.220]   they become less faithful representatives
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.540]   of what's out there.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.740]   And yet, when I've done intermittent fasting
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.760]   and I do a kind of modified version of it,
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.280]   my mental clarity is far better
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.180]   than when I've had a big bowl of pasta,
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:40.180]   probably for other reasons related to serotonin
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:44.980]   and tryptophan, and so I think for the typical listener
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.820]   out there, I have to imagine
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.100]   it's got to be a little confusing, right?
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.980]   We hear neurons love glucose, they live on glucose.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.020]   And here we're saying, let's deprive them of some glucose,
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.280]   or let's just bring glucose levels down,
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.160]   or let's switch the fuel source of the brain
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.820]   from glucose to ketones,
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.980]   and now the brain really works the way it's supposed to.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.500]   So this raises a little bit of a just-so-story question,
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:11.500]   like why would it be the case that neurons love glucose,
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.540]   and yet, if there's too much glucose around,
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.500]   they become sick?
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.480]   And of course, with any why-would-it-be story,
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.220]   as I always say, you know, I wasn't consulted
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:22.940]   at the design phase, and I'm going to presume
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:25.660]   that you weren't consulted at the design phase either,
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.020]   and that if any of us say that we are,
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:29.780]   then we are probably the patients that need evaluation.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.460]   So I think there's a name for that, right?
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:32.480]   There's delusion, right?
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.180]   Okay, throughout my first correct clinical assessment
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.060]   of myself.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:40.040]   So how do I get my head around this, right?
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.700]   You've got me sold on mitochondria,
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.900]   not that I needed to be sold, but that's an easy,
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.060]   like yes, yes, absolutely yes.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.860]   The idea that diet can impact mental health
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.580]   and physical health, yes, absolutely,
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.340]   by way of mitochondria, at least in part, great.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.460]   But then neurons love glucose.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.540]   So what's going on, or what do you think is going on?
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:05.640]   - I am not convinced that glucose is the real story.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:16.080]   Glucose may in fact be a symptom.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.140]   So we know that parts of the brain,
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.340]   you know, there have been a couple of studies
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:25.900]   that just came out in the last couple of weeks, I think,
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:30.900]   documenting that actually astrocytes in the hypothalamus
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:37.180]   play a key role in glucose regulation throughout the body.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:43.380]   And it appears to be a metabolic role,
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:48.060]   which in my mind implies that the mitochondria
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:51.580]   in those astrocytes are probably playing a key role,
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:54.480]   because we know mitochondria play a key role
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.180]   in sensing glucose levels.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.180]   They play a key role in the release of insulin
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.780]   from the pancreas.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:09.020]   But mitochondria in the brain is also playing a role
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:14.240]   in kind of balancing how much glucose is around.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:20.060]   And so it's a difficult question,
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:24.000]   because I think in some cases, high glucose levels
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.780]   are actually a symptom of metabolic dysfunction
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.600]   somewhere in the body or brain.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.840]   And when I think about, well, what does that mean?
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.500]   In my mind, most of the evidence currently is pointing
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:46.500]   to mitochondrial dysfunction somewhere in the body or brain
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.580]   that is the most likely cause
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:52.980]   of that dysregulation of glucose levels.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:31:00.780]   But we know that if you consume massive amounts
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:04.980]   of junk food, sugar, and other things,
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.820]   that you can get dysregulation of glucose levels.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:17.400]   The conundrum though is that that's not a universal response.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.160]   - And what about the typical person?
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.040]   I've never really liked junk food that much.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.640]   Maybe as a kid, I can recall liking candy,
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:27.120]   but I was a sandwich for lunch person for a long time.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.200]   And as I've changed that out for salad
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:33.660]   and maybe a small piece of meat with my salad
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.020]   or something like that, I feel far better during the day,
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.880]   far more alert, but I do eat carbohydrates.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.280]   I eat starches typically at night,
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.580]   but I tend to do some very hard training
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.920]   at some point during the day.
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.320]   So I imagine I have some glycogen to repack.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:46.400]   Okay, that's me.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.720]   I only mentioned that because I'm not in ketosis
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.560]   as far as I know.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.320]   I haven't, unless you brought the strips,
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.840]   I haven't done the blood glucose test today.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:00.000]   So what about the typical person who's an omnivore
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   eating some rice, some pasta, pasta salads,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.300]   people that are eating not junk food,
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.980]   massive amounts of sugar,
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.380]   but have blood glucose that's in kind of moderate range.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.400]   Do you think, and here feel free to speculate,
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.780]   do you think that those people might feel far better
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:22.020]   or even a little bit better
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:26.800]   if they were in a lower glucose state?
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:29.880]   And I asked this because I think there are a lot of people
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.920]   out there who suffer from full-blown depression,
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.500]   but there are also a lot of people who suffer
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.880]   from like moodiness and feeling not so great,
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.440]   subclinical depression.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.380]   - Yes, burnout is what I would call it.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.880]   - Yeah, and just feeling like some days are great
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.280]   and then other days they feel lousy
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.440]   for reasons they don't understand.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.520]   - Yeah.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.140]   - And those make for less dramatic case studies.
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.880]   And yet I have to assume that that description
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:56.420]   will net a large fraction of the general public.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.160]   - So the way that I kind of break this field,
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.280]   and I'm probably getting too nerdy right now,
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:07.200]   but I kind of break this field into cause,
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.200]   what's the actual root cause,
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.520]   and what are effective treatments?
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.960]   And I really see them as two separate things.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:22.960]   Just because the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.400]   does not imply that the cause of the problem
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.040]   was eating carbohydrates.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.320]   And I think that's a really important distinction.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.660]   There are many people who disagree with me on that.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.760]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.660]   And everybody's heard people say,
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:40.560]   sugar is the cause of everything that ails you,
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.840]   or carbs are the cause of everything that ails you.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.320]   If everybody does a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet,
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.880]   and then they go to,
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.740]   so it must be sugar that was the cause.
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:56.500]   I don't see it as clearly black and white as that.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:01.220]   The calorie restriction, ketogenic diet,
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:06.220]   carbohydrate restriction are inducing metabolic changes
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.560]   in the brain and body.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.860]   And regardless of what the person was eating,
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.400]   they are inducing metabolic changes
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.540]   that can be really beneficial to brain health.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:23.480]   So let me just give a clear black and white example of this.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.440]   And then I can speak to the broader topic
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.560]   that you brought up about just the general population.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.260]   The easy example of the ketogenic diet
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:34.480]   being an effective intervention
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.660]   for somebody who was not following a bad diet
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.480]   is an infant with epilepsy.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:44.840]   There are lots of infants who have uncontrollable seizures.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.360]   They are drinking breast milk.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.580]   To the best of our knowledge,
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:53.320]   that is the primary most beneficial food source
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.100]   an infant could be consuming.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.120]   Now some might say, well, maybe the mother's,
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.560]   you know, whatever, I don't buy that.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.320]   The mother's breast milk is in fact
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.920]   the optimal food source for that infant.
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.380]   And yet that infant is still seizing.
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.720]   If we put that infant on a ketogenic diet,
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.020]   a lot of those infants' seizures will stop.
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.200]   It doesn't mean that the cause of the infant's seizures
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.240]   was a bad diet, but it means a dietary intervention
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.240]   can change brain metabolism
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.880]   and improve symptoms in that person.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.980]   So going to your broader question about adults modern day,
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:36.960]   the real answer is, you know,
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.000]   there was just this conference in London,
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.680]   the Royal College of Obesity Medicine
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.840]   or something like that.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.020]   That's not the name, but it's something along those lines.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:51.940]   The conclusion of that conference,
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:56.440]   it invited the greatest minds in obesity medicine.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.860]   The overarching conclusion of that conference was,
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:01.220]   we don't know what causes obesity.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:08.520]   It's really important that we sit with that.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:11.140]   We don't know what causes obesity.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.920]   - They don't think excess caloric intake
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.740]   beyond one's daily metabolic needs is causing obesity.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:22.280]   - Some will argue that, and so some will say yes,
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.800]   it's all energy balance,
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.960]   but why do we have an epidemic of obesity?
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.040]   - Well, that's the gazillion dollar question.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.440]   - And junk, some will say it's all the junk food,
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.480]   but we had junk food in the 1970s.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.200]   When I was growing up, I grew up on Kool-Aid
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.520]   and Twinkies and King Dongs and Ho-Hos and-
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:46.800]   - Oh, I'm rewatching the Mad Men series now.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.480]   I love that series and I'm rewatching it.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.360]   And I happen to know someone who worked on that series.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.320]   They research everything for the props and the costumes,
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.620]   everything, but right down to diet.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.920]   And if you look at the diet, it was terrible.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.340]   It was mostly, yes, there was a lot of excessive amounts
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:01.720]   of drinking and cigarette smoking,
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.680]   but the diets were terrible.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.240]   It was prepackaged foods.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.500]   It was frozen dinners.
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.080]   I mean, that really came to prominence
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.960]   in the '70s and '80s.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:14.160]   But even in the '50s and from what I've been reading,
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.000]   even in the '30s and '40s,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.200]   people were not eating grass-fed meat and Brazil nuts
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.920]   with a little bit of broccoli rabe on the side.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.160]   That is not the typical intake.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.780]   So something out there or maybe multiple things
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.820]   are at play to increase obesity.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:37.420]   - And at the end of the day, I believe,
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.920]   some will call this speculative,
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   but I actually think we've got a tremendous amount
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.440]   of evidence that continues to point in this direction.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.080]   I believe that mitochondria are the key
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.400]   to the obesity epidemic,
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:54.460]   that there is something in our environment.
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:59.120]   So that is either our food, environmental toxins,
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.120]   stress levels, poor sleep, not getting adequate sunlight,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.440]   whatever you want to speculate on, all of the above.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.400]   All of those things are known
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.080]   to impair mitochondrial function.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:19.080]   And if parts of your brain that regulate metabolism
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:23.600]   and that regulate eating behaviors
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.160]   are not metabolically healthy,
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.620]   it means that they will not stop you from eating,
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.220]   or it means that your metabolism will not rise
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:38.200]   to the challenge of 10 donuts,
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.160]   because some people can eat 10 donuts
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.880]   and go on staying thin and healthy.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.520]   - Although I totally agree,
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.800]   although I would just like to say that it seems to me
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.280]   that compared to when I was growing up,
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.100]   and again, I haven't run the statistics,
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.860]   there are fewer and fewer of those individuals around now.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:55.300]   Just as when I was growing up,
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:00.300]   it was one or two kids in class that were quite overweight,
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.740]   and then there were some that were mildly overweight,
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:05.100]   but most were of healthy weight.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:08.560]   Nowadays, that's dramatically altered.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.560]   The landscape is dramatically altered in the other direction.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.200]   It is rare when I encounter one of those
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.020]   can eat anything type people.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.920]   I know one, he's actually an employee at Stanford.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.460]   He's on our media team at Stanford.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.020]   And this guy, when I take him to lunch, it's like,
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:26.960]   and he's in his early 70s, and he can eat,
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.040]   and he's incredibly lean.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.200]   He exercises a little bit,
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.320]   but he's one of these mutants that just can eat,
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.240]   and eat, and eat, and he's lean, and he's vital,
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.520]   and it's wild, and he's an expensive lunch.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.240]   But those people seem rare,
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.440]   and even those kids are now seem rare.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.000]   - They're getting increasingly rare.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.940]   And that leads me to think it may be epigenetic factors
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.640]   in the womb environment,
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.960]   so that kids are actually coming out predisposed
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.180]   to obesity.
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:01.160]   - Well, let me ask you about that,
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.000]   because I had a note here to ask this later,
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.120]   but I'm going to interrupt you now
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.540]   in order to capture this moment.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.840]   My understanding is that,
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.560]   well, as everyone knows, we inherit DNA.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.880]   We get genes from both of our parents, and they mix.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.880]   Although there are incredible data
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.600]   from Catherine Dulock's lab at Harvard,
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.520]   and others showing that we actually have
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.600]   entire regions of our brain that carry neurons
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.740]   that are purely of mom's or of dad's DNA,
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:27.720]   depending on the brain region.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.760]   This is a wild finding, but it's accurate,
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.880]   and this has actually been known about
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.360]   in terms of heritability of disease, et cetera.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:40.800]   Maternal DNA, DNA from mom, genes from our mother,
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.220]   not to place blame on mothers at all,
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.300]   my understanding is that the mitochondrial DNA
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.800]   come exclusively through the maternal side.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.440]   Is that true?
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.680]   - So it's a great question,
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.920]   and I've been asked this before,
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.280]   and yeah, psychiatrists are known for blaming mothers,
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.760]   and some might say that I'm trying to redo
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.980]   that whole thing and blame mothers again.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:04.560]   - The data or the data, I'm not trying to blame mothers here.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.880]   Mothers play an essential role in everything,
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.920]   but if it is true that mitochondria
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.160]   are the linchpin of all this,
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.920]   and maternal DNA is what determines the mitochondrial DNA,
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.480]   I think it's an important place to look.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.640]   - It's an important question,
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.440]   and the answer is unequivocally no.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.480]   That's not the way it works.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.720]   - Vindication for anyone that was asserting that.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.840]   - And so let me explain it.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.160]   So mitochondria have 36 genes unto themselves.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:34.560]   13 of those genes code for some of the mitochondrial
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:38.920]   machinery of making ATP, and the other 36 play roles
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.300]   in epigenetic regulation, play roles in whole body
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.800]   metabolism and other things.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   So that is what you're inheriting from your mom,
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.800]   is the mitochondria and those 36 genes for the most part.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:59.340]   But the majority of proteins that make up mitochondria,
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:03.140]   over I think 1,300 genes that make up mitochondria
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:06.900]   are actually encoded in the nuclear DNA.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:09.780]   And so you inherit a copy from both your mother
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:11.100]   and your father.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.600]   So the majority of people who have mitochondrial defects
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:19.600]   or rare mitochondrial diseases actually could inherit them
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:24.600]   from either mom or dad, because it can be a defect
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.600]   in the nuclear genes that code for proteins
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.000]   that make up mitochondria.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.360]   The much bigger issue, so when I talk about
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.520]   mitochondrial dysfunction being a primary driver
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.800]   of mental illness, metabolic illness,
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.120]   it's not that people inherit a defective mitochondrion
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.520]   or mitochondria from mom, and then that just ruins
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.200]   their life forever.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.560]   That's actually not the way it works.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.520]   The beautiful thing about this theory is that it connects
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.760]   all of the risk factors that we already know play a role
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.320]   in mental health, but also metabolic health.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.680]   Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.800]   and mitochondrial function.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.320]   Stress, high levels of stress and trauma
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.780]   impair mitochondrial function.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.760]   Drug and alcohol use.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:29.760]   Alcohol, tobacco definitely in terms of the smoke,
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.600]   and marijuana, THC in particular,
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.840]   all impair mitochondrial function.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.360]   - THC directly or the smoke?
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.400]   - THC directly, those studies have been done.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.400]   And so mitochondria actually have CB1 receptors, right?
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000]   On them, and various researchers, a couple of studies
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.200]   from Nature actually documented this,
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.200]   that the mitochondrial CB1 receptors are primary,
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:08.640]   kind of primary points of the influence of marijuana
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.600]   on human behaviors and effects.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.200]   So because when they remove CB1 receptors
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.120]   in animal models, these changes don't happen.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.960]   So the CB1 receptors, we've got some large studies
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.700]   of adolescents who use a lot of marijuana,
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:31.200]   and the areas where the mitochondria have the greatest number
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.460]   of CB1 receptors are areas of their brains
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:38.560]   that actually are atrophied or shrunk
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.960]   compared to normal healthy controls.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.840]   So that means their brain tissue is aging prematurely,
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:48.840]   it's shrinking prematurely, but the CB1 receptors
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:51.440]   on mitochondria also seem to play a role
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:55.320]   in the memory impairment that can be induced from THC,
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:45:01.920]   and they also play a role in the kind of lack of motivation,
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:07.640]   the behavioral amotivational state from THC.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.200]   Now again, for people who want to chillax,
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.960]   that's what they're looking for.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.680]   They don't want to remember anything.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:16.360]   They don't want to think.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.580]   They want to be spaced out.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:20.380]   They want to relax.
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:24.560]   That's great, but it's important that they know
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:26.800]   that they're actually harming the mitochondria
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.600]   in their brain cells,
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:34.080]   and that although there's always an opportunity
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.960]   to repair mitochondria and always an opportunity
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.160]   to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:42.520]   so you can get it back, but if you keep doing it chronically
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:46.000]   you're probably not helping your overall mental
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.120]   or metabolic health.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.520]   - Yeah, I'm glad you brought up THC.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:49.880]   We did an episode on Canvas.
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.620]   We also did one on alcohol.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:54.020]   Probably lost some friends from that one.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.700]   I mean, when you look at the data, it's very clear.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:59.040]   I mean, I'm not arguing that people dislike the effects
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.060]   of these compounds when they take them,
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.100]   but it is clear that, at least to me, based on the data,
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:08.280]   that regardless of what people have read about red wine,
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.720]   that not drinking any alcohol is going to be healthier
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.840]   than drinking alcohol, and that the thresholds for alcohol
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.220]   ingestion before people start to negatively impact
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.440]   their health is about one or two per week.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.960]   And then THC, because of the very high concentrations
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.120]   of THC that are present in a lot of products now,
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:26.100]   vaping and smoking THC and even edibles,
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.440]   that it can be problematic.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.880]   You mentioned adolescence, you know,
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.040]   predisposition of brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.280]   In any case, because you mentioned alcohol
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.600]   and because it is a commonly used substance,
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.560]   I heard you give a talk in which,
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.320]   I think I have this right, in which alcohol
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:52.320]   can disrupt the way that the brain uses fuels of all kinds,
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.520]   which may disrupt one's response to alcohol,
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.940]   make alcohol seem more rewarding to those that drink alcohol.
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:06.000]   So drinking alcohol makes alcohol more rewarding
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.420]   to the brain's alcohol drinkers.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:12.800]   But that it also might alter glucose metabolism,
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.680]   that basically alcohol is not good for our brains.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.800]   Do I have that correct?
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:18.900]   - You do have that correct.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.740]   - Okay.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.780]   What happens if you take an alcoholic
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:26.060]   or somebody that just drinks, you know,
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:28.740]   two to four nights a week, a couple of drinks,
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.420]   which I think is pretty common out there,
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:33.620]   and you put them on a ketogenic diet,
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:35.220]   has that experiment been done?
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.980]   - That experiment has been done.
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:41.980]   And led by none other than a woman named Nora Volkow,
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:45.100]   who is one of the leading neuroscientists
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.600]   and addiction researchers in the world.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.220]   She is the director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:54.820]   She's been hot on the trail of metabolic abnormalities
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:57.740]   in the brains of people with alcohol use disorder,
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:00.140]   which I will just refer to as alcoholics,
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:03.020]   because that's what everybody knows it as.
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.980]   So she's been hot on this trail for many, many years.
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:11.980]   And as you said, it turns out that the reward pathways
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:17.840]   in particular are metabolically compromised in alcoholics.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.500]   And the metabolic compromise essentially in a nutshell
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:24.100]   means they aren't getting enough fuel from glucose.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:27.920]   The interesting thing is that when people drink alcohol,
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.260]   your liver converts alcohol into a molecule called acetate.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.820]   That acetate travels up to the brain
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.820]   and fuels brain cells, in particular,
[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:41.060]   some of these reward pathway cells more than others.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:46.060]   And so chronic alcoholics have this chronic deprivation
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:49.580]   of energy in these cells.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:52.380]   And so Nora Volkow and other researchers
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:55.780]   at National Institutes of Health did a study
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.340]   in which they set out to see if we can change
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:04.900]   this brain metabolic problem in alcoholics.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:08.820]   Will that affect clinical symptoms of alcoholism
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:13.420]   and will it do anything that's clinically useful?
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:18.420]   And so they actually did a pilot randomized controlled trial,
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:22.020]   admitted alcoholics to a detox unit.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:24.520]   Half of the patients got a ketogenic diet.
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.340]   The other half got the standard American diet.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:32.140]   And then everybody else, all of them got the same detox protocol.
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:35.580]   The patients who got the ketogenic diet
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:40.280]   required fewer benzodiazepines for their detox.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.620]   Despite that, they had fewer withdrawal symptoms
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:46.240]   from the alcohol.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.700]   They reported fewer cravings for alcohol.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:53.100]   And the researchers did brain scans
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.220]   which showed improved brain metabolism
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:59.480]   in these key areas that they were looking at.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:05.580]   And their brains showed reduced levels of neuroinflammation
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:09.300]   which was also something they were really interested in.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:13.460]   And so that one study says to us
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:16.860]   that even though most people would think
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.820]   alcoholism has nothing to do with diet,
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:22.180]   alcohol is just drinking too much.
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:24.340]   It's a matter of willpower.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.860]   Or it's somebody who's addictive.
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:27.820]   They've got an addictive personality.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:29.260]   And it's that simple.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.500]   You come out of the womb with an addictive personality
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:36.020]   and those people are novelty seekers
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:39.420]   and they're impulsive and they have no patience.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:40.740]   They have no discipline.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:45.480]   They can't sustain any kind of rewarding experience.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.020]   - Or childhood trauma.
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:51.580]   There's a story there, which they're very well maybe.
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.020]   - And there may be.
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:57.780]   But what that research study strongly suggests,
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:01.300]   and again, yes, maybe we need larger controlled trials,
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:03.780]   but this is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:04.780]   who's hot on this trail.
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:08.300]   This is what she believes and this is what I believe,
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:11.860]   is that if we can correct the brain metabolic defects
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:13.980]   from chronic alcohol use,
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:17.500]   we might be able to help people be sober
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:21.500]   and give them a fighting chance or give them an edge up
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:25.940]   or pull a lever that we can use in their favor
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.660]   for their benefit.
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.560]   There's one caution to all of this research
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.220]   that I really do want to highlight.
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:33.220]   And so now I'm going to get hate mail
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.320]   from all the keto community.
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:36.160]   - That's okay.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.540]   I mean, anytime I admire you
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.940]   for talking about nutrition at all,
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.580]   because anytime one talks about nutrition,
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:44.680]   you're going to get hate mail from somebody, but.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:48.700]   - So the caveat to all of this is that
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:53.700]   as part of the research that those researchers were doing,
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:57.180]   they actually wanted to see what will happen
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:59.780]   to alcohol levels
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:04.780]   if an animal consumes alcohol while on a ketogenic diet.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:08.240]   So they didn't do this in humans yet.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.260]   This is a fairly easy study to do.
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:13.000]   So I'm hoping somebody will do this study soon.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.460]   But they instead put rats, half of them on a standard diet
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:19.180]   and half of them on a ketogenic diet.
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.200]   And then they expose them
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.840]   to the exact same amount of alcohol.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.060]   The rats who were on the ketogenic diet
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.920]   had a five-fold increase in blood alcohol levels.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.380]   Five-fold increase.
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:34.720]   - Meaning they drank more or it was metabolized differently?
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.540]   - It was metabolized differently.
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:39.220]   The rats all got the same amount of alcohol.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:42.500]   - So for people out there who are ketogenic,
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.500]   I'm a little chuckling, but who are not alcoholics,
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.400]   please alcoholics, please do something about it
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.460]   'cause it's so detrimental.
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:50.240]   But I guess, does this mean that they can drink less
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.080]   in order to get the effect of alcohol
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.240]   that most people are seeking?
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.660]   - Cheap dates.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.300]   Cheap date is what you call that.
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:59.740]   You only need a half a drink instead of three drinks.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:01.740]   - I would think the keto community would thank you for this
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:05.240]   unless they somehow have a stake in the alcohol industry.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.460]   - The reason that I put it as a caution
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:12.280]   is that if anybody is struggling with alcoholism
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:14.300]   and thinks, "Hey, I need an edge up.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.880]   I need a lever to pull because I'm really struggling
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.560]   to give this stuff up."
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.220]   I just find myself going back.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:23.540]   And if you're telling me my brain metabolism is messed up
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:27.540]   and this might help it, I'm all in favor of that.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:29.840]   And yes, that's what the researchers are pursuing.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:34.120]   And that's what I'm saying with the following caveat,
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.780]   that if you relapse while on a ketogenic diet,
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:40.340]   you better not drink the same amount of alcohol
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:42.120]   that you think you can drink.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.340]   - Could be deadly.
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:49.100]   - It could be deadly and/or it could be really deadly
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.420]   to you or someone else because unfortunately,
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:53.180]   a lot of times when people drink,
[01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:55.580]   they get behind the wheel and they think
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:58.420]   that they can handle two drinks safely.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.780]   And they think, "Well, I can go out for dinner
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:04.040]   and have two glasses of wine and drive home safely."
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.540]   I know myself.
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:08.480]   If you go to a ketogenic diet,
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.500]   please don't drive with the same two drinks
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.740]   because it means your blood alcohol level,
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:18.160]   if it models anything that we found in the rat study,
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:20.660]   your blood alcohol levels may be five times higher
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:22.320]   than they would normally be.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:25.200]   And that means you are really wasted
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.440]   and you're probably not safe to be driving.
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.840]   - Probably the same is true for drinking
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.300]   on an empty stomach, right?
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:31.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.920]   No, that's a very important point
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.900]   and thank you for raising that.
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:39.900]   I mean, I hear this again about mitochondria,
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.960]   about blood glucose.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.060]   You mentioned astrocytes.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.140]   And for those of you who heard that earlier,
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:49.460]   astrocytes are a non-neuron cell type in the brain,
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:53.020]   a glial cell type that my postdoc advisor
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:56.620]   was known for popularizing the modern science of glia,
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:57.620]   which include astrocytes.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:00.740]   And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that they do,
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:03.180]   they are considered the cells
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:04.580]   that hold everything together in the brain
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:06.260]   and are kind of passive observers,
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:09.400]   but they do many things actively there.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.720]   I think now people appreciate the astrocytes
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.720]   as at least as important as the neurons.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.260]   And certainly for disease,
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:20.820]   they are often implicated in warding off of disease, et cetera.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.420]   Everything that you're telling me about,
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:24.340]   the fact that the brain can regulate things
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.060]   that are happening in the body, metabolism, et cetera,
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.660]   organ health, obesity, et cetera.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.260]   To me as a neuroscientist, that's not surprising.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.240]   All of it just screams hypothalamus, hypothalamus,
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:37.020]   hypothalamus, 'cause here you're telling me
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:40.360]   it's regulating these basal functions like metabolism.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.880]   It's regulating how much we crave things.
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.800]   And of course, hypothalamus is involved
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:45.960]   in motivation and craving.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.480]   There are other areas too,
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:49.400]   other areas of the brain too, of course.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:52.960]   But I would imagine that someone ought to,
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:57.960]   or has mapped out where the receptors
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:00.280]   for all this business are in the brain.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.480]   And I guess that raises the question
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.880]   of when one goes on a ketogenic or low blood glucose diet
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:12.360]   or FAS, has anyone observed changes in the brain?
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:15.700]   Has anyone had neuroimaging of humans and their brains
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:19.480]   under conditions of ingesting one diet or another,
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:21.280]   whether or not they're suffering
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:23.400]   from a psychiatric disorder or not?
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:26.540]   I would think that's where the gold is.
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:29.500]   - We do have some of those studies.
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:33.540]   So, and they've, when you do a neuroimaging study,
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.180]   you can measure a lot of different things.
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.180]   So one thing, with a PET scan,
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:39.580]   you can measure glucose metabolism.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:43.740]   So a researcher, Steven Cunane, is doing that research,
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:47.620]   in particular in Alzheimer's disease patients
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:51.220]   and Alzheimer's disease models, but in humans.
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:56.220]   And that's because we know that, again,
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.380]   a common finding in patients with Alzheimer's disease
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.900]   is this glucose hypo metabolism.
[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:04.420]   Some people are attributing it
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:07.300]   to insulin signaling impairment.
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:10.340]   And so some people are calling it type three diabetes.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:14.200]   The end of the day, I think the clearest signal
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.740]   that we have is that cells aren't getting enough energy
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.100]   from glucose as a fuel source.
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:23.540]   That is something that I think I can confidently say
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:26.780]   that's backed by numerous research studies.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.300]   There's debate in the research field
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:31.740]   about whether that's a primary driver of the illness.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.660]   I happen to believe it is.
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:35.340]   And if you ask the question,
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.640]   well, why would cells not be getting enough fuel
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.780]   from glucose, you have to focus on mitochondria
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:43.020]   'cause they're the ones producing the fuel
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.020]   from that glucose.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:46.500]   So somehow you have to implicate mitochondria
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.480]   in that process one way or another.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.660]   Others will say, no, that's just a side effect
[01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:55.500]   of whatever's causing Alzheimer's disease.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.300]   So Steven Cunane has done studies
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:59.780]   where he even gives ketone supplements.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:01.580]   - So these are liquid ketone esters?
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:04.980]   - So yeah, ketone esters or ketone salts.
[01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:06.660]   And it has actually found
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:11.460]   that these brain metabolism deficits can be corrected
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:16.200]   at least short term by giving a ketone supplement.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.180]   - Is this in the context of people
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:20.080]   also ingesting some carbohydrate?
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:23.740]   Because I confess, I've tried the ketogenic diet.
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:24.860]   I probably did it wrong.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:27.140]   This was years ago and then the cyclic ketogenic diet.
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:30.100]   But in the last year or so,
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:33.380]   I've started using liquid ketone esters.
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:36.180]   And I do eat some carbohydrates each day,
[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:37.920]   usually in proportion
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.220]   to how much high intensity exercise I'm doing.
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:46.260]   Those liquid ketone esters for me, at least subjectively,
[01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:48.740]   I feel like greatly increase my energy levels
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:51.680]   and my ability to focus mentally.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:53.020]   And they improve my sleep.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:55.580]   This is my observation, tracking some data,
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:57.380]   but just again, subjectively.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.900]   So in this example,
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:01.040]   are you talking about people taking ketone esters
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:04.780]   or ketone salts on a backdrop of a ketogenic diet
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.900]   or on the backdrop of a more typical diet?
[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:09.900]   - So he's done both.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:14.140]   So he's done studies where patients
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:15.940]   aren't doing anything special with the diet.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:18.280]   So they're eating whatever they normally eat,
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:20.380]   absolutely non-ketogenic,
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:23.620]   giving them a ketone salt or ester,
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:26.820]   and then noticing immediate and direct changes
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:29.460]   in the metabolism of these
[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:32.460]   metabolically compromised brain cells
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:35.240]   as measured by pet imaging.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:38.180]   - These are not household pets, by the way.
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:40.380]   I'm sorry, you have to just pee,
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:42.500]   positron emission tomography, not pets.
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:44.340]   Although I'm sure that there are people out there
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:46.420]   who have their dogs or cats or whatever,
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:48.220]   or their pet kangaroos,
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:50.280]   whatever you might own on ketogenic diets.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.120]   Okay.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:51.940]   - Absolutely.
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:53.900]   And so he's actually moved further.
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.720]   He's done a pilot trial in a nursing home, actually,
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:00.320]   where he did not put the patients on a ketogenic diet.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:04.500]   He simply reduced carbohydrate consumption
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.060]   at breakfast and lunch.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:09.900]   They still got the same dinner as everyone else.
[02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:12.660]   And simply reducing carbohydrate consumption
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:14.600]   at breakfast and lunch
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.780]   resulted in cognitive improvement
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:19.820]   in a statistically significant way
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:21.420]   in some of those subjects.
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:22.500]   - I love that result.
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:23.760]   I'm sorry, I just have to highlight this.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.460]   I'm a huge believer in directing carbohydrates
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.860]   to specific portions of the day
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:31.940]   when one needs to be less focused and alert
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.020]   and yet can replenish glycogen.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:38.700]   Limiting carbohydrates most of the time during the day
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.380]   for me has been a game changer
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:42.900]   in terms of maintaining alertness, et cetera.
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.860]   I'm not aware that I have age-related cognitive decline,
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:48.940]   but then again, people around me may argue otherwise.
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:50.940]   - Let me say, you are Andrew Huberman.
[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:54.020]   There is no way you have cognitive impairment.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:54.860]   - Although you didn't know me as a six-year-old.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.420]   - If you have cognitive impairment, we're all screwed.
[02:00:57.420 --> 02:00:59.700]   - Well, I have plenty of flaws and impairments,
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:02.900]   well over 3,000 documented by people very close to me.
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:07.640]   But this is very interesting, I think,
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:09.460]   in the context of everything we've been talking about
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:14.460]   because could it be that supplementing with liquid ketones
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:17.860]   or prescribing liquid ketones
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:22.300]   to people who are challenged with mood disorders
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:24.180]   or things of that sort could be beneficial
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:26.980]   even if they are not willing or able
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.180]   to adhere to a ketogenic diet?
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:31.300]   - That is the million dollar question right now
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:36.300]   and we don't have good trial data to say yes or no.
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:42.020]   My speculation, my hunch,
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:44.980]   having tried that clinically with patients
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.480]   is it doesn't seem to work.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.080]   It's not the same thing.
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:56.760]   The bigger reason for my feeling confident in saying that
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:01.360]   is that we've had ketone salts and esters available
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.580]   for over a decade now.
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:08.100]   We have tens of thousands of children and adolescents
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:10.140]   who are following a strict,
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:12.820]   ridiculously strict ketogenic diet
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:14.640]   to control their epilepsy.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:19.920]   Those kids would love to be off the ketogenic diet.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.280]   Their parents would love to have them off
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.880]   the ketogenic diet. - Yeah, no birthday cake,
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:25.720]   no ice cream.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:30.720]   - There is not one case report of any child
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:35.740]   controlling his or her seizures using exogenous ketones
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:38.640]   without also doing the ketogenic diet.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.780]   I just find it hard to believe
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:45.220]   that at least some of those people haven't tried it out
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:46.680]   to see.
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:50.320]   I do know some patients with bipolar disorder
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.660]   and even schizophrenia
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:57.460]   who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet.
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:00.540]   They have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.780]   using exogenous ketones.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:04.920]   Their symptoms came back
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.460]   and so they found that it just wasn't effective.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:10.200]   Again, those are anecdotes.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.360]   My scientific speculation about why
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:17.360]   is because the ketogenic diet
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:22.360]   is actually not necessarily about ketones themselves.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:27.800]   Ketones are one of a multifaceted story there.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:31.900]   When people do a ketogenic diet,
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:35.420]   they're also lowering glucose levels.
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:38.740]   They're improving insulin signaling.
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:42.760]   They're ramping up mitochondrial biogenesis
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:45.420]   in particular in the liver
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:49.280]   because mitochondria actually make ketones.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.300]   That's where they're made
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:53.720]   and they're primarily made in the liver mitochondria.
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:56.640]   So when somebody's in a fasting state
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.020]   or on a ketogenic diet,
[02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:02.460]   their liver mitochondria go through the roof
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:04.460]   because they're being called to action.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:07.980]   It's like, hey, body's in starvation mode, get to work.
[02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:11.460]   And so the mitochondria, the cell senses,
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.700]   we need more mitochondria to process fat,
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.100]   to turn it into ketones
[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:18.180]   so that those ketones can get up to the brain
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:19.980]   and keep the brain fueled
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:23.540]   because fatty acids can't fuel the brain.
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:25.880]   Only ketones can.
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:29.220]   Now, so my sense is that,
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:31.500]   and the gut microbiome changes and everything,
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:32.960]   the changes in hormones.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.040]   So if you're eating a lot of donuts
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.620]   and drinking a bottle of ketones,
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:42.760]   the donuts are going to prevent your body
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.900]   from lowering glucose levels.
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:46.640]   You're still gonna have the high glucose levels
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.780]   from the donuts.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:48.920]   You're still gonna probably have
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.940]   the impaired insulin signaling.
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.700]   You're probably still going to possibly have
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:57.140]   some inflammation from the inflammatory effects
[02:04:57.140 --> 02:04:58.400]   of that food.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:04.460]   And so just drinking ketones alone won't be enough.
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:09.060]   I think for people who are metabolically healthy,
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:10.840]   I'll include you in that,
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:15.020]   I think ketones can play a really beneficial role, no doubt.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:19.800]   I think exogenous ketones may in fact
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:23.420]   prove invaluable in clinical use
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:25.060]   for patients who maybe can't follow
[02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:26.760]   a super strict ketogenic diet
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:29.480]   but maybe could do a low carb diet.
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:31.180]   And then given the research that's happening
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:33.280]   with alcohol use disorder,
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:36.020]   I could imagine a situation,
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:39.380]   here's the million dollar tip
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:41.120]   to whoever wants to go out and get this
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.580]   if it actually turns out to be true.
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:45.380]   I could imagine a scenario
[02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:48.860]   where we use exogenous ketones with alcoholics
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:52.020]   and that every time they have a severe craving for alcohol,
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.220]   they drink ketones instead.
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:56.640]   - Which sort of tastes like alcohol.
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:59.180]   The ketone esters, when I take them,
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:00.300]   I drink them straight.
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:01.560]   Sometimes I'll put them in seltzer
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.020]   and I'm not a big drinker, as I mentioned.
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:05.720]   I might have an alcoholic drink every once in a while.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:07.100]   I just don't ever crave it.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:09.380]   I just do it every, maybe,
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:14.260]   I think 2020 was the last time I had a drink of alcohol.
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:17.620]   So obviously I'm not a good representative example.
[02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:19.880]   But the ketones taste good to me
[02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.860]   and they obviously don't get you drunk.
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:26.180]   They do seem to flick on my alertness pretty quickly.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:30.120]   And my understanding is that they
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:33.520]   are the brain's preferred fuel source,
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:36.320]   meaning they are going to be the first fuels
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:38.080]   used by the brain
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:43.080]   when there's a buffet of fuels available.
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.320]   If there's glucose in my bloodstream,
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.560]   there's circulating liquid ketones,
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:50.340]   that ketones would be used first or preferentially.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:51.180]   Is that true?
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:55.320]   - I think it's a complex question.
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:58.680]   I mean, some research that we have
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:03.160]   suggests that there are brain areas or brain cells
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:07.560]   that require glucose and cannot use ketones.
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:11.200]   So 100% of the brain cannot be fueled with ketones,
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:12.940]   as far as we can tell.
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:16.660]   So there are some areas that require glucose
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:19.280]   and that's probably the reason we have gluconeogenesis
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.040]   is to keep the body going
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.200]   and to keep the brain going no matter what.
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:28.320]   But when ketones are available,
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:30.520]   especially if ketones are high,
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:35.860]   the way I think about it is not that ketones
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:37.540]   are like the preferred fuel source
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:39.860]   and glucose goes to the wayside.
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:43.400]   But the way I think about it is that you have a range
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:48.400]   of cells with varying degrees of metabolic health.
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:51.720]   And some of those cells are gonna be extraordinarily healthy
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:56.720]   with appropriate healthy abundant mitochondria.
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.360]   And those cells are probably going to continue
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:02.040]   to use glucose as a fuel source.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.840]   But if ketones happen to be there,
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:06.160]   sure, they'll use that too, like why not?
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.900]   But the real money is metabolically compromised tissues,
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:14.440]   whether it's brain cells or other tissues
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.240]   but we're talking about the brain.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:19.840]   So if you've got metabolically compromised brain cells,
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:21.460]   'cause it's not across the board,
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:24.040]   like with Alzheimer's brain scans,
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:25.720]   there are specific regions
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:28.200]   that are more metabolically compromised than others.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.800]   And that's why we see patterns of atrophy
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:36.680]   in specific brain regions is because those regions
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:40.160]   are dysfunctional metabolically for whatever reason.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:43.000]   And we can get into why that might be.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.620]   But my sense is that if you've got
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:47.480]   a metabolically compromised cell,
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:51.080]   that cell is sending out a distress signal.
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:56.000]   That cell is calling resources from the body,
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.120]   like feed me, give me something.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.520]   And if it can't use glucose effectively,
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:04.160]   it is gonna suck up those ketones
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.500]   and then start running on all cylinders or closer to it.
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:13.500]   And that process is so critical
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:17.600]   because what it means is that if that cell
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:22.600]   was barely getting by on 60% of its real ATP requirement,
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:27.320]   it means that it doesn't have enough energy
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:30.720]   for maintenance and repair functions.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.720]   As soon as you give that cell 100% energy or close to it,
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:37.720]   even if you get it up to 90%
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:41.780]   of its preferred energy amount,
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:44.840]   it can start to repair itself.
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:47.800]   I mean, that's the beauty of the human body
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:51.280]   and living organisms is that they have a priority list
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:53.360]   of what they're gonna do.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.360]   And if that cell senses that there are defective molecules,
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:04.900]   defective proteins in this cell that need to be replaced,
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:07.540]   once it gets enough fuel,
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:12.280]   it will start repairing itself and doing that work.
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.200]   - That makes sense.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.880]   Thank you for that clarification.
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:18.900]   I'd like to talk about Alzheimer's
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:22.400]   and age-related cognitive decline generally.
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:25.880]   I know many people out there are just terrified
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:29.280]   of losing their memory for the obvious reasons,
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.600]   memory sets context, et cetera.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.520]   And many people have relatives that suffer from Alzheimer's
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:36.900]   or other forms of dementia.
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:42.080]   I've heard that the ketogenic diet and diets like it
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.760]   can be very effective for helping to offset
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:48.820]   some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:50.420]   and age-related cognitive decline.
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:54.160]   In fact, I even have a friend I won't out him by institution
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.880]   who's the chair of cardiology
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.240]   who contacted me of all people,
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:03.240]   asking whether or not I was aware of any studies
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:05.080]   or whether or not I knew of anybody
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.320]   who had benefited from ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:10.160]   And I thought, well,
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.280]   why don't you ask one of your colleagues in neurology?
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:14.400]   But his response was really interesting.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.440]   He said, there are many books out there
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:18.400]   for the general public.
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:21.100]   There are a lot of online discussions about this.
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:22.520]   There are a lot of assertions about this
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:24.480]   and some animal studies.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:26.540]   But again, these are his words.
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:31.120]   There are very few, if any,
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.600]   controlled clinical trials exploring the role
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.300]   of the ketogenic diet for the treatment or reversal
[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:39.820]   of Alzheimer's and age-related cognitive decline.
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:41.760]   I'm hoping that statement was incorrect
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:45.040]   or soon will be incorrect because those trials are ongoing.
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.000]   But he said, yeah, you know,
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.560]   the people who are most popular for telling us
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.700]   about the important role and positive role
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:56.460]   of being in ketosis for Alzheimer's,
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:59.480]   for some reason, they just won't do a clinical trial.
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:02.360]   And that's been frustrating to the community.
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:05.040]   So this is a very educated, very accomplished person
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.900]   who's a physician of heart medicine
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:12.160]   as opposed to something else related to the brain.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.400]   But what is the story there?
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:18.160]   And for goodness sake, why aren't there clinical trials
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.320]   on ketogenic diet and Alzheimer's?
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:25.320]   I don't expect you to be responsible for that fact,
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:28.100]   but goodness, I would think this would be
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:31.080]   like the obvious thing for NIH.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:32.520]   I'm on the study section, you know,
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:34.920]   but not for these sorts of experiments.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:38.140]   Why isn't money just avalanching into this area
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:40.340]   based on all the anecdotal evidence
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:42.340]   that people are talking about?
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:47.100]   - So we've got a couple of small pilot clinical trials.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:50.580]   The best one was a randomized controlled trial.
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:54.540]   I think it only included 26 subjects, something like that.
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:59.540]   Randomized to 12 weeks of a low fat diet, 10 week washout,
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:04.420]   12 weeks of ketogenic diet.
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:07.900]   Some of the participants got keto first and then low fat.
[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:11.140]   Other participants got low fat, then keto.
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:13.820]   And that trial actually found
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:18.740]   that when patients were in ketosis,
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:24.340]   they had statistically significant improvement
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:29.060]   in activities of daily living and quality of life.
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:32.420]   And they did have improvement in cognitive function,
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:34.980]   but it didn't reach statistical significance.
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:36.480]   That improvement did not.
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:40.780]   We've got other trials.
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:44.020]   We've got several animal models showing
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:47.520]   that the ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:51.180]   of Alzheimer's disease in Alzheimer's models.
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:53.700]   So it can reduce plaques and tangles,
[02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:58.240]   can even improve cognitive impairment in animal models.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.240]   We've got a couple of other small pilot trials
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:06.440]   of ketogenic diet in humans showing
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:09.320]   that it improves biomarkers compared to, say,
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.620]   the low fat diet or the American Heart Association diet.
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:13.940]   So we've got those.
[02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:16.820]   I think one of the biggest challenges
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:18.820]   that I'll just share openly,
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:21.540]   and this is, I'm somebody who's pretty passionate
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:24.540]   about this research and I believe it has a lot of potential,
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:30.580]   but Johns Hopkins researchers attempted
[02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:33.700]   to do exactly this kind of a study.
[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:39.200]   Alzheimer's patients, ketogenic diet versus the,
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:42.220]   I think American Academy of Aging or something like that,
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:44.580]   diet is the control diet.
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.340]   - Which presumably has starches in there.
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:47.580]   I think that's the key variable.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:50.260]   - Probably lots of, yeah, lots of whole grains,
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:51.100]   lots of whole grains.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.020]   - Yeah, some potatoes.
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:58.220]   And they spent, I believe, over three years,
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:02.560]   they screened over 1300 participants,
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:06.680]   1300 people who expressed interest.
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.680]   The end of the day, I think they only got 27 people
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.680]   to enroll and only 14 of those people completed the study.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:21.420]   Despite that, what they found was that the subjects
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:25.920]   who achieved ketosis had cognitive improvement.
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.540]   But people on study section are gonna look at a study
[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:35.540]   like that and say, even if the science is there,
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:39.900]   if you can't get people to do this diet,
[02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:43.660]   why would we spend money on researchers trying
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:45.340]   to get people to do this diet?
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:49.880]   - I should mention study section is this closed door panels
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:53.620]   of 40 or so people, there are many of these panels,
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:58.040]   different divisions of the National Institutes of Health
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.100]   use different panels and then grants are evaluated
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:04.100]   and in a very small, because of the size
[02:16:04.100 --> 02:16:05.360]   of the federal budget for research,
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:10.360]   a very small percentage, usually about 10% of these studies
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:14.960]   are funded, the rest generally don't end up happening.
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:20.000]   That is very informative.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.780]   What you just described is very informative
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:26.660]   because now it makes sense to me that there's no conspiracy.
[02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:29.260]   It's not like big pharma, I don't think is trying
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:33.780]   to suppress trials of ketogenic diets on Alzheimer's
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:35.940]   because I would imagine the first thing that pharma
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:37.860]   would want to do is to see that study done
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:40.340]   so they didn't have to and then the moment it was done,
[02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:41.420]   if it showed a positive effect,
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:43.200]   they'd probably want to isolate the molecule
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:45.740]   and wrap it up in something that people would take, right?
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:46.580]   - Yes.
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:48.160]   - So I don't think there's any active suppression by pharma.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:51.000]   I think pharma would probably be cheering from the sidelines
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.720]   because they could capitalize on it
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:54.800]   because ultimately the studies are done by scientists,
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:56.880]   but the treatments are generally doled out
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.540]   by pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians.
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:01.720]   So I don't believe there's a conspiracy there.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:04.880]   That is very interesting and it's kind of amazing
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:07.680]   given our discussion of earlier,
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.740]   which is that you had a patient
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:12.340]   that was having schizophrenic symptoms
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:14.240]   who managed to stay on this diet.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.280]   So is there something special about Alzheimer's patients
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:20.200]   and people with age-related cognitive decline?
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.820]   Presumably they're very dependent on others
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:26.560]   to cook for them and shop for them.
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.420]   I think that this is an almost perfect controlled environment
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:30.760]   for getting this study done.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:33.800]   - I think that is the key issue.
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.480]   So again, I get patients with bipolar disorder,
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:43.480]   schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.560]   To do this diet and stay with it,
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:51.400]   but it's because I'm providing a weekly session for them.
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.000]   And I imagine this study did not provide
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.400]   that kind of intensive support.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:01.760]   So I think in the pilot trial that I described to you,
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:04.680]   they actually got, I think, over 90% compliance
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.560]   with the different dietary interventions.
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:12.120]   So some of it is gonna be dependent on the research group,
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.360]   and does the research group understand
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.340]   that this is not, it's not like prescribing a pill.
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:21.260]   Here, take this pill and take it every day
[02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:23.420]   and come back in three weeks.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:25.360]   And even then, we don't know for sure
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.280]   that the patient took the pill every day.
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:29.440]   We just assume they took the pill every day
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:32.380]   and studies say they probably didn't.
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:35.720]   But so I think when we think about a dietary intervention,
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.720]   we need to think about more intensive support and education.
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.360]   And that support could be a health and wellness coach.
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:46.120]   It could be a dietician.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:48.620]   It could be education of the family.
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:53.620]   It might even be providing them with dietary, like meals,
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:57.880]   that maybe for six months,
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:02.880]   we actually provide them with ketogenic meals once a week,
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.840]   put them in your freezer, microwave them when needed
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:12.720]   to make this diet as easy and doable as possible.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:17.000]   Because if we can get people to do the diet,
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.880]   if we can get them through the first couple of months,
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:23.340]   most people can learn how to do this diet.
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:27.080]   More importantly, I didn't mention this before,
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:30.380]   but the number one reason I am so successful
[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:34.000]   at getting patients to stay on this diet for years
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.200]   is because of the consequences to them when they go off
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:39.040]   of it.
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:43.340]   That is the reason I can get schizophrenic patients
[02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:45.640]   and bipolar patients to do this diet,
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:49.160]   whereas other people can't get an everyday human being
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:50.920]   to do it for weight loss.
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:54.280]   Because the weight loss patient doesn't experience
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:59.280]   devastating tormenting symptoms when they break the diet.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:02.400]   Oftentimes they are rewarded.
[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:05.200]   They eat something they really enjoy,
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:07.560]   and they get a little bit of a dopamine rush from it,
[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:08.960]   and they're off to their aces.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:11.200]   They're like, I'm gonna, oh, I've already cheated.
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:12.060]   I'll cheat again.
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:13.560]   I'll get back on it someday.
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.940]   And they never get around to it.
[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:19.300]   My patients, when they go off the diet,
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:24.080]   they start hallucinating within 24, 48 hours,
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:27.320]   and they quickly realize that was a really stupid thing
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:28.200]   to do.
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:32.260]   That piece of cake was not at all worth the torment
[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:34.440]   that I'm experiencing now.
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:36.420]   So they get back on the diet.
[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:38.380]   I suspect with Alzheimer's disease,
[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:41.220]   we might notice something similar.
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:44.880]   These people, some of these people have very mild symptoms,
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:49.280]   so maybe they won't have that kind of a reinforcement,
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:52.640]   negative reinforcing kind of experience.
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:54.500]   But I think some of them will.
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:59.500]   Some of them recognize that they are impaired cognitively.
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:04.360]   And if this diet could help them remember better,
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:07.320]   if this diet could help them function better,
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:08.780]   and again, that's what the pilot trial showed
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:10.480]   is activities of daily living.
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:12.500]   That means these people are able to go to the bathroom
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.460]   on their own.
[02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:15.540]   They're able to get themselves dressed,
[02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:18.980]   whereas they needed help with those things before.
[02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:22.900]   Those are actually really important things
[02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:26.020]   to both the patient and the caregiver.
[02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:30.460]   And if they go off the diet and then quickly revert
[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:33.780]   into a more symptomatic state,
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:37.780]   that might be reinforcing enough for them
[02:21:37.780 --> 02:21:41.500]   to figure out a way to do the diet on their own.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:42.740]   And if we think about, you know,
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:44.740]   if this really is an effective intervention,
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:48.060]   and yes, we need longer trials, larger trials, all that,
[02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:51.900]   'cause there are plenty of stories in the medical field
[02:21:51.900 --> 02:21:55.580]   where pilot trials looked really spectacular
[02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:57.720]   and promising, and then larger trials
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:21:59.700]   just failed to show the benefits.
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:05.260]   I believe based on all the science of metabolism,
[02:22:05.260 --> 02:22:08.320]   mitochondria, glucose, hypometabolism, all of that,
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:13.320]   I believe the science makes this an obvious treatment
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:15.960]   that has real potential.
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:19.180]   So, you know, people will call me biased.
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:20.740]   That's fine, I've got my bias.
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:22.780]   - No, based on clinical observation
[02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:25.560]   and extensive clinical observation at that.
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:28.780]   I think biases that are simply because we want to feel
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:33.500]   a certain way or believe something are worth critiquing,
[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:36.780]   but bias based on observation.
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:38.440]   Here, I should mention that, you know,
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:42.260]   most of what we know about human memory
[02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:45.100]   was sparked by one patient, a famous HM,
[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:48.780]   who I think was living in Harvard Medical,
[02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:50.020]   in one of the hospitals around there,
[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:54.940]   many hospitals on Longwood campus, but one patient.
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:57.360]   I mean, the reason we associate the hippocampus with memory
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:23:01.120]   is because we knew that HM's hippocampus was damaged,
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:04.380]   intentionally damaged for epilepsy treatment, right?
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.820]   So this idea that everything has to be
[02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:09.580]   a randomized clinical trial to me is crazy.
[02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:14.020]   I mean, of course that's a gold standard and it's essential,
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:17.400]   but there's so much information in textbooks,
[02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:19.080]   medical textbooks in particular,
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:21.860]   that are gleaned from single patient case studies
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:25.300]   or from three patient neurostimulation in the brain
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:26.420]   or something of that sort.
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:30.860]   So to me, I'm still perplexed as to, you know,
[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:35.860]   why there's this insistence on only one form of evidence.
[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:39.740]   Clearly what you're doing,
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:41.500]   the important work that you're doing clinically
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:43.860]   and in the research side and in public communication
[02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:45.140]   is assisting this.
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:49.420]   I have a question about, or more of a statement/question
[02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:51.600]   about the ketogenic diet.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.840]   Based on everything that we've talked about,
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:57.660]   seems to me that the ketogenic diet for weight loss
[02:23:57.660 --> 02:24:00.280]   is a very interesting aspect of the diet
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:03.160]   as is intermittent fasting for weight loss,
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:06.100]   even though it might just be by way of caloric restriction
[02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:08.060]   that occurs with fasting.
[02:24:08.060 --> 02:24:09.540]   But then in some ways,
[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:13.220]   the effects of the ketogenic diet on weight loss
[02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:15.360]   are a bit of a decoy for most people.
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:16.560]   That's where their mind goes.
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:18.240]   This person lost X amount of weight.
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:19.320]   Maybe that made them feel better.
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:20.680]   Maybe that actually made them underweight.
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:22.160]   I think you've talked about it for some people
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.700]   that can actually bring them underweight.
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:28.280]   But I'm glad that we got the chance to dive
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:30.700]   into the description of ketogenic diet for epilepsy,
[02:24:30.700 --> 02:24:33.560]   because it really is a medical intervention
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:36.280]   that has a side effect of weight loss
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.180]   or could be used to treat obesity and induce weight loss.
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:44.180]   But it's really about far more than that.
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.380]   And that raises a question for me, which is,
[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:49.980]   you know, we've been talking about the ketogenic diet
[02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:51.120]   as one thing,
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:54.760]   but I've heard you discuss this before where, you know,
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:57.960]   just as a physician will prescribe different dose,
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:00.680]   dosage ranges of a given drug,
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:03.240]   you can prescribe different dosage ranges
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.540]   of a nutritional plan, a diet.
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:06.680]   It's not one thing.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:09.180]   It's not necessarily zero carbohydrates
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:10.660]   or a hundred grams or 50 grams.
[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:14.200]   It depends on the patient and a lot of other factors.
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:16.760]   I've heard you list off various things, classic keto.
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:19.540]   Maybe you could just briefly tell us what that typically is.
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:22.060]   'Cause I think most people think it means eating
[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:24.760]   a lot of meat and not carbohydrates,
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:28.020]   but might not be that fasting.
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:30.940]   And then some of the other, you mentioned Atkins earlier.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.500]   We don't have to go into each of these in detail.
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:33.340]   And I know in your book,
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:36.020]   you talk about not just the science and clinical background,
[02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:39.220]   but also some actionable steps that people could consider.
[02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:41.500]   So they can refer there for more detail.
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:44.980]   But for somebody who let's say is depressed,
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:46.740]   they've had some rounds of depression.
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:48.980]   Maybe they're on antidepressants, maybe not.
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:51.400]   And they want to try something like this.
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:53.340]   Obviously this has to be done in concert
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:56.300]   with a physician observing all this.
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:00.260]   But what is the typical thing that you probe with first?
[02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:01.100]   Just like with a drug,
[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:03.160]   you'd might probe with 20 milligrams of a drug.
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:08.160]   What's your typical initial dietary intervention probe?
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:09.620]   Terrible languaging, I realize.
[02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:11.920]   And I'm criticizing myself for that,
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:14.180]   but I think people get the idea.
[02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:17.620]   - The real answer is that I don't have a one size fits all
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:19.620]   recommendation for any person.
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:22.020]   So the first thing that I'm going to assess with the patient
[02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:24.580]   is what symptoms are they having?
[02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:26.580]   What is their current diet like?
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:28.760]   And what are they willing to do?
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:30.760]   I try to meet them where they're at.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:34.700]   So if somebody, you know, and I want to point out,
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:38.120]   like you mentioned the all meat version of this diet,
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:41.220]   which is often referred to as the carnivore diet.
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:42.620]   - A very controversial diet.
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:44.340]   - There is no doubt that exists.
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:45.940]   And for some people, some people swear by it.
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:48.340]   They swear that they've tried other versions of ketogenic
[02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.460]   diets and only when they went to a carnivore diet,
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:52.220]   did they get benefits.
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:55.100]   But there are vegetarian and vegan versions of the
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.180]   ketogenic diet.
[02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:57.640]   So in my mind,
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:01.580]   this is not at all about the diet wars of animal source
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:03.460]   versus plant source foods.
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:06.860]   It's about inducing a state of ketosis,
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:09.120]   which is mimicking the fasting state.
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.580]   That is what it's about.
[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:14.380]   And you can do that by not eating anything by fasting and,
[02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:17.260]   or intermittent fasting and you get your results.
[02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:21.700]   So no diet is a ketogenic diet.
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:24.780]   So it's not about the foods or the types of foods that
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:25.620]   you're eating.
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:28.300]   It's about inducing a state of ketosis.
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:30.820]   The first variable I'm going to look at when I recommend
[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:34.500]   this or prescribe this is the person's current weight.
[02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:39.500]   If somebody is obese versus somebody who's thin,
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.240]   I'm going to use different dietary strategies for those two
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.220]   situations.
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:44.580]   In the obese patient,
[02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:48.380]   they have tons of fat stores on their body already.
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:52.140]   Usually it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those and
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:54.900]   they'd like to lose some weight if they're going to try a
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:57.860]   ketogenic diet for brain health anyway.
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:27:59.900]   And so I'm going to use that.
[02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:01.820]   So that person really,
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:05.860]   the diet is carbohydrate restriction and that usually is a
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:07.460]   sufficient intervention,
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:11.180]   both simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars and fructose.
[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:13.380]   Also fructose, definitely.
[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:16.780]   So no added sugars essentially.
[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:20.660]   You can have added natural sweeteners like Stevia or monk
[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:21.540]   fruit.
[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:24.260]   You might use artificial sweeteners.
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:28.280]   I'd probably years after of doing this,
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:30.780]   I'd probably recommend steer away from them if you can,
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:33.300]   because I think they tend to stimulate cravings for high
[02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:35.100]   carb foods.
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:38.700]   So if you can kind of get through a couple of weeks without
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:41.820]   sweet things,
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:44.820]   your cravings for those will go down and it'll make the diet
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.420]   easier and a little more sustainable.
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:49.700]   But let's say you can have your artificial sweeteners,
[02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:51.260]   if that's what you really want.
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:55.300]   So I'm going to say less than 20 grams of carbs a day for
[02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:57.000]   those people.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.120]   They can have all the protein they want.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:01.960]   They can have vegetables and they can have all the fat they
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:05.080]   want, but I'm not going to push fat on those people.
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:07.820]   I'm not going to tell them eat a lot of fat at the same time,
[02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:11.700]   because I want to use the fat on their body as the fat
[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:14.340]   source, at least early on.
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:16.700]   - Are you encouraging healthy fats like mono and saturated
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:21.380]   fats like olive oil or are you encouraging people to eat a
[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:24.380]   little less butter, et cetera?
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:27.340]   - I, I, I tend to,
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:30.740]   I tend to encourage again,
[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:33.420]   a wide range of fats and it's going to depend on the person.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:37.320]   A lot of times people come to me with very specific ideas,
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:41.420]   but I'm going to tend to encourage olive oil, avocados,
[02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:42.540]   nuts,
[02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:45.060]   which are usually considered even by the American Heart
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:47.420]   Association, healthy sources of fat.
[02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:51.320]   The more controversial thing are things like coconut oil or
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:52.460]   coconut cream,
[02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:55.140]   which the American Heart Association might say is not a
[02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:56.240]   healthy fat.
[02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:00.300]   I kind of disagree with that and don't think it's unhealthy
[02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:01.160]   at all actually.
[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:04.880]   And when you look at the epidemiological studies of
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.220]   saturated fat causing heart disease or causing adverse
[02:30:09.220 --> 02:30:11.380]   outcomes at best,
[02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:14.500]   maybe increases your risk 10 to 15% at best.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:17.420]   - How much coconut oil can people ingest anyway,
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:20.700]   before they either develop diarrhea, no joke,
[02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:23.460]   or, or just sort of get tired of coconut oil.
[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:27.180]   But anyway, your point is taken,
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:30.900]   but they can eat meat if they like meat or eggs,
[02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:32.360]   or if they don't like meat and eggs,
[02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:34.300]   they could eat sardines or things of that sort.
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:36.420]   I mean, I personally can't, I can't even stomach the,
[02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:38.540]   I don't even like the word sardine.
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:41.700]   I have nothing against the actual fish, but that's just me.
[02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:42.940]   But obviously people have,
[02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:45.580]   I say this because people have different preferences, right?
[02:30:45.580 --> 02:30:46.420]   - Yes.
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:47.880]   - I'll eat a steak, but I'm not going to eat a sardine.
[02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:49.100]   - And I'm going to go with that.
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:49.940]   And again,
[02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:53.780]   there are vegan sources of protein that people can eat tempeh
[02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:55.340]   and, you know, other things.
[02:30:55.340 --> 02:31:00.340]   So that's the obese person is carb restriction is the primary
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:04.660]   initial phase.
[02:31:04.660 --> 02:31:07.760]   The thin person is going to need to eat a lot of fat because
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:10.500]   they don't have a lot of fat stores on their body.
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:14.040]   And if I want them in ketosis, clinical ketosis,
[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:15.640]   I'm going to have to feed them fat.
[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:18.420]   So that's the person that I'm going to say,
[02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:22.840]   make sure you get in avocados, olive oil, butter,
[02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:25.680]   maybe a cream, heavy cream.
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.020]   So heavy cream is delicious.
[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:30.660]   It's a delicious way to get your fats in and have one
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:33.360]   patient who just drinks it straight to just try to get it in
[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:34.200]   other people.
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:35.040]   - I get it.
[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.200]   I like, I've never had an appetite for sweets.
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:41.420]   I absolutely love savory, fatty food.
[02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:44.460]   And I, when I was in high school, I was, I was thin.
[02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:48.160]   So I was able to do this, but I used to drink half and half.
[02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:49.920]   Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and drink it
[02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:51.700]   just cause it tastes so, so good.
[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:52.880]   - It does taste good.
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:55.020]   So, so if they're on a ketogenic diet,
[02:31:55.020 --> 02:31:58.380]   I'm going to push them away from half and half and toward
[02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:03.120]   heavy whipping cream and, and so you can whip that up.
[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:04.040]   You can freeze it.
[02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:05.380]   It turns into ice cream.
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:06.360]   You can add vanilla.
[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:07.680]   You can add cocoa powder.
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:08.960]   You can add all sorts of things.
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:12.160]   And you you're off to the races with shakes and ice cream
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:15.120]   and mousse and all sorts of things that you can have.
[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:20.040]   With any of these patients,
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:24.100]   the beauty of this diet is I have objective biomarkers.
[02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:26.740]   I'm going to have them measuring ketones and I'm going to
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:30.520]   adjust the diet based on their state of ketosis and,
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:32.820]   or the clinical benefits that I'm looking for.
[02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:37.260]   If it's an average person who is not currently under
[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:41.760]   psychiatric care, not taking prescription medicines,
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:45.980]   but is saying I'm burned out, I'm exhausted.
[02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:48.680]   I want some of that brain energy that Andrew Huberman's
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:51.280]   talking about, he talks about feeling good.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:53.240]   I want some of that.
[02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:55.600]   I'm probably actually going to recommend the protocol you
[02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:57.340]   described, which is,
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:01.200]   let's see if we can just carb restrict for a while
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:04.480]   and see if that produces clinical benefit.
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:07.240]   I have one, he's not even a patient,
[02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:11.660]   just somebody who read my book.
[02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:13.660]   I didn't tell him anything.
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:16.960]   And he came away from it saying he was ready to start an
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:20.080]   antidepressant or an antidepressant for his anxiety,
[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:22.560]   had chronic anxiety, was trying meditation,
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:23.800]   was trying all sorts of things.
[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:27.640]   Nothing, nothing, those things weren't enough.
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.320]   He was ready to go on prescription medicine.
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:32.240]   He read an early copy of the book.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:34.840]   He took it upon himself without consulting with me to
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:36.600]   restrict carbohydrates alone.
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:38.480]   He did not go ketogenic.
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:40.760]   He is a vegetarian.
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:45.360]   He restricted carbs within three weeks said,
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:47.280]   I don't need prescription medicine.
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:49.980]   I can't believe how much better I feel.
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:53.560]   And all I did was cut out some of the high carb foods
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:55.240]   in my diet.
[02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:58.420]   So I think for some people it can be that simple.
[02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:02.360]   For people with serious mental disorders,
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:04.100]   if they are chronically depressed,
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:06.040]   if they're on lots of prescription meds,
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:07.940]   if they're disabled by their symptoms,
[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:12.200]   and certainly if you're bipolar or have schizophrenia
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:15.280]   or something, those are the people I really do want them
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:17.120]   to work with a medical professional,
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:20.440]   because meds may need to be adjusted.
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:25.440]   They really need, they need a real shot at this diet.
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:28.140]   It's not like weight loss.
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:30.480]   Weight loss, everybody wings it.
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:32.320]   And either you're successful or you aren't.
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:35.840]   You look on the internet or you read a book or you do,
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:37.640]   even the colleague that you mentioned,
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:39.120]   he's probably just reading,
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:43.120]   who knows whether it's credible information or not.
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:48.160]   And just winging it and seeing whether it works or not.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.120]   For people with serious mental disorders,
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:56.400]   I want you to treat it like you have epilepsy.
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:01.080]   'Cause you do have a serious brain disorder.
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:04.160]   Like it's impairing your ability to function in the world.
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:06.700]   It's impairing your health and happiness.
[02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:09.680]   You deserve a competent medical treatment.
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:10.760]   And we have that.
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:14.300]   We have a hundred year evidence base.
[02:35:14.300 --> 02:35:17.000]   We've got dieticians who know this
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.780]   like the back of their hand.
[02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:22.300]   They can monitor your level of ketosis.
[02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:27.080]   They can help look for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:29.480]   that can be a consequence of the diet
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:31.960]   and make sure that you're not developing those.
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:34.960]   They can help tweak the diet if needed.
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:35.920]   They can give you ideas
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:38.060]   if you're getting bored with eggs every morning.
[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:40.840]   They can give you ideas for what else you might have.
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:45.180]   And if you're using it to treat a serious disorder,
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:46.820]   I think you need serious help.
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:51.220]   - Couple of questions, a little more detailed,
[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:54.180]   but I think a lot of people will have this on their mind.
[02:35:54.180 --> 02:35:58.200]   Is it ever the case that you'll prescribe somebody
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.640]   the ketogenic diet in conjunction with intermittent fasting?
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:04.980]   So eat keto, but eat between the hours of whatever,
[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:08.160]   11 a.m. and 8 p.m. or something like that.
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:09.080]   That's the first question.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:09.920]   - Absolutely.
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:13.300]   So, and I have one patient with type two diabetes
[02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:14.580]   and chronic depression,
[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:18.220]   and he will try to follow the ketogenic diet
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:22.760]   and sometimes his blood sugars are still very high.
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:24.680]   And sometimes I will ask him
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:26.340]   to do either intermittent fasting
[02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:30.140]   or even a three or four day water fast.
[02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:32.980]   And it is shocking.
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:36.580]   When he does a three or four day water fast,
[02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:38.840]   the first day or two, he feels like crap.
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:40.900]   I'll just say upfront,
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:43.020]   don't do it if you've got an important meeting
[02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:45.060]   or business trip or any, like don't be--
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:46.740]   - So this is just consuming water?
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:48.060]   - This is just consuming water.
[02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.140]   - No black coffee?
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:52.420]   - I usually tell him he can have
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:56.340]   plain black coffee or tea, but--
[02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:58.260]   - You have mercy after all.
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:00.360]   - I have a tiny ounce of mercy.
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.260]   But when he does it,
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:07.780]   his blood sugars plummet in a good way.
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:10.700]   Like his blood sugars are normalizing.
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:12.660]   But the last time he did it,
[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:16.220]   he actually got to seven days at one point.
[02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:18.540]   And he said, I feel great, I want to keep going.
[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:20.820]   I can't believe that I'm not hungry,
[02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:22.780]   but I am not hungry at all.
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:25.020]   I don't miss food at all.
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.180]   And at seven days, I kind of cut the cord.
[02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:30.540]   I was like, no, no, we're done, you got to eat.
[02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:31.740]   - Well, I find it really interesting
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:33.220]   that the intermittent fasting, of course,
[02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:35.700]   controversial at some level,
[02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:39.340]   but as to whether or not it's just beneficial
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:40.820]   by way of caloric restriction,
[02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:43.400]   'cause it is one way to achieve caloric restriction,
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:45.180]   whether or not it has additional benefits.
[02:37:45.180 --> 02:37:49.180]   But I'm very interested in the neural side of it.
[02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:51.200]   And it does seem that the fasted state
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.020]   can start to take on its own rewarding properties
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:57.040]   where people get dopamine release,
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:59.380]   not from eating as most everyone does,
[02:37:59.380 --> 02:38:01.380]   but from abstaining from food.
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:02.940]   Now this can be pathologic
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:06.460]   and in the sort of example of anorexia nervosa,
[02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:10.540]   which is both know as the most deadly psychiatric illness.
[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:14.200]   But for non-anorexics, I think it's interesting to note
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:15.940]   that eventually not eating
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:18.560]   can have its own rewarding properties to it
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:20.580]   that aren't just related to weight loss,
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:22.480]   but in the short term, feeling, in other words,
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:25.120]   feeling really good by way of abstaining from eating.
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:25.960]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:29.760]   - Well, and that's actually, it raises an important risk
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:32.000]   that I haven't mentioned yet,
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.820]   but at least in psychiatric patients,
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:36.460]   but even in some patients who just use the keto diet
[02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:41.100]   for weight loss, I have seen definite hypomania.
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:43.480]   - So these are people that aren't sleeping very much.
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.940]   They're, are they also getting kind of delusional thinking?
[02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:49.500]   They're gonna run for president.
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:53.460]   - No, so the distinction between hypomania and mania,
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:56.820]   so mania, you might become psychotic and delusional.
[02:38:56.820 --> 02:38:59.700]   Mania by definition is problematic.
[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:02.100]   It's causing a problem in some way or another.
[02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:03.760]   And if you have psychotic symptoms,
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:06.700]   it's definitely called mania, full-blown mania.
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:09.620]   Hypomania, for better or worse,
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:12.760]   is something every human being probably craves.
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.580]   So it is feeling extraordinarily good.
[02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:20.500]   It's getting by on less sleep, but you don't need to sleep.
[02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:21.380]   Who needs sleep?
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:22.780]   I've got things to do.
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:27.780]   I am, my brain is running on all cylinders.
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:31.320]   I feel so creative.
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:35.300]   There've been lots of famous people through the ages
[02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:38.960]   who have been bipolar, you know, probably bipolar,
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:42.640]   and some of their most productive periods of time,
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:47.040]   whether it's art or creating scientific models
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:51.100]   or what have you, were probably during hypomanic episodes.
[02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:52.460]   - So what do you do in that case?
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:56.260]   I mean, I'm obsessed with getting sufficient quality sleep.
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:59.140]   It's a kind of a repeating theme in our podcasts
[02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:01.780]   and many of my social media posts.
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:05.380]   And I always recommend behavioral tools first,
[02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:09.020]   then, you know, exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera,
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:11.140]   the appropriate times, avoiding late night,
[02:40:11.140 --> 02:40:13.040]   artificial light exposure, et cetera.
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:16.800]   And occasionally for people who are doing all that
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:19.380]   and still struggle with sleep supplementation,
[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:22.660]   one of the things that I've seen some data on
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:25.720]   is that for people who are following a low carbohydrate diet
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:28.400]   that inositol in particular can be helpful
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:31.120]   for getting it into sleep,
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:32.640]   probably because it's a bit of an,
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:34.980]   has a bit of an anti-anxiety effect.
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:36.800]   But presumably there are other things out there too.
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:38.400]   The magnesiums will generally do that.
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:40.940]   A hot bath will do that too, for that matter.
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:42.920]   But what you're talking about is people who are going,
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:44.800]   what, a day and a half without sleep,
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:47.600]   or they're just, you know, two hours of sleep a night?
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:50.240]   - I have, so the worst case I saw
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.920]   was actually a mental health professional
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:53.840]   who didn't recognize it initially.
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.260]   He went six months with two to four hours
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:40:58.420]   of sleep every night.
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:40:59.860]   - Because they were on a ketogenic diet.
[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:01.720]   - He was on a ketogenic diet,
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:04.820]   was getting by on two to four hours of sleep every night,
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:08.300]   did not initially recognize that this was a problem.
[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:10.820]   He was feeling great.
[02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:14.440]   He was feeling that keto high.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:19.040]   And he was actually waking up and like at 4 a.m.
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.280]   going for 10 to 20 mile runs most days.
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:26.200]   He finally stopped the ketogenic diet after about six months
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:28.840]   because he said, I can't maintain my weight.
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:30.720]   So I'm losing too much weight.
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:31.600]   - Sorry, I didn't mean to drop.
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:33.000]   So what do you, I was just thinking there's some
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.080]   social media personalities associated with nutrition
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:37.620]   that might be hypomanic.
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:42.460]   I'll let you do the clinical evaluation.
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:43.780]   So what does somebody do in that case?
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:47.260]   So I don't know that I've ever been hypomanic,
[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:49.000]   but as I mentioned earlier,
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.640]   unless I've done a very high intensity workout
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:53.600]   early in the day and I need to replenish carbohydrates,
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:57.200]   I typically eat meat, fruit, and vegetables
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:00.720]   throughout the day, minimum amounts of fruit, but some.
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:03.680]   And then at night I switch over to mainly carbohydrate.
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:04.840]   It really helps me sleep.
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:06.760]   It replenishes glycogen stores.
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:09.460]   I sleep really well, wake up the next morning, repeat.
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:12.680]   And of course this goes against a lot of the dogma that,
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:13.900]   oh, you're not supposed to eat carbohydrates
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:14.740]   late in the day.
[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:17.420]   And this is what works for me.
[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:19.140]   And so I do it.
[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:23.060]   For somebody like this mental health professional
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:26.680]   who was hypomanic, would going off the ketogenic diet
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:28.560]   entirely be the best idea?
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:31.760]   Or could it be that adjusting when they eat
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:34.380]   their carbohydrates would be advantageous
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:36.880]   in order to make sure that they felt alert and great
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.440]   during the day, maybe not hypomanic,
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:43.440]   but then we could have a four to eight hours a night sleep
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:45.960]   as opposed to a two to four hours a night,
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:47.560]   which is really very little sleep.
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:48.400]   - Yeah.
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:49.300]   - It can't be healthy.
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:50.340]   - It's not healthy.
[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:51.840]   - Even if you can do it and feel great,
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:53.760]   I imagine that the brain is suffering.
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:54.600]   - It is.
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:55.880]   And the body is suffering.
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:57.420]   - And your friends and family are suffering.
[02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:59.880]   - The body is repairing itself with sleep.
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:04.880]   And so yeah, if it's somebody who is not a patient,
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:09.260]   they're not a mental health patient,
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:11.180]   they're not using the ketogenic diet
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:12.600]   as a mental health treatment,
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:14.640]   they're simply doing it for whatever.
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:20.640]   I actually start with everything you've just outlined.
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.180]   Let's start with behavioral measures first.
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:27.600]   And the first intervention is education.
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:31.760]   You need at least six hours of sleep a night, period.
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:34.560]   End of story, that's non-negotiable.
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:37.580]   If you're not getting at least six hours of sleep a night,
[02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:39.880]   we need to consider this a problem.
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:42.640]   So figure out a way to get six hours of sleep.
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:44.120]   For some people, that's enough.
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:45.080]   Just the education.
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:49.320]   They don't get out of bed at 3 a.m.
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:51.300]   It might take them an hour to fall back to sleep.
[02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:52.660]   They fall back to sleep.
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:58.280]   For most people, if you can get three nights of decent sleep
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:00.480]   in a row, the hypomania goes away.
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:04.640]   That is the way to extinguish it.
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.500]   And then they still go on feeling a high from it.
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:10.340]   They feel great.
[02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:14.300]   Their brain feels good in terms of memory,
[02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:17.420]   concentration, motivation, all of those things.
[02:44:17.420 --> 02:44:19.340]   But they're not hypomanic anymore.
[02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:24.120]   And then I might use supplements, melatonin,
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:26.520]   others that you mentioned.
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:28.080]   Magnesium is a big one.
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:33.040]   And for some, I will recommend exactly what you're doing.
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:36.060]   Eat some carbohydrates in the evening
[02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:37.680]   before you're going to bed.
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:39.400]   Either have them at dinner,
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:41.560]   and then wait a few hours before you're gonna go to bed,
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:43.920]   or have them right before you're gonna go to bed,
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:48.840]   just to try to calm your body down and get it going.
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:52.780]   When I'm using this as a clinical intervention,
[02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:55.780]   especially with patients with serious mental illness,
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:45:01.020]   I actually want them in a state of ketosis long-term.
[02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:03.740]   So I'm not gonna do the carbohydrate intervention.
[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:05.960]   I'm gonna try all the other ones.
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.840]   But if they still can't sleep,
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:10.280]   even with supplements, over-the-counter supplements,
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:13.700]   then I'm probably gonna go with prescription
[02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:18.700]   sleeping medicines as a temporary stop-gap
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:23.880]   to try to get them three to seven days of decent sleep
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:26.480]   that usually breaks the hypomanic cycle.
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.760]   And then they stay on the ketogenic diet
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:31.640]   because it ends up resulting
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:34.840]   in all of these other improvements that I've described.
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:37.780]   Their illness can sometimes go into full remission.
[02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:43.280]   - Is it low-dose trazodone as a first-line prescription?
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:44.960]   - I would not use trazodone.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:47.200]   I would actually specifically avoid trazodone
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:49.680]   because it's an antidepressant
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:51.280]   and they're already hypomanic.
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:54.040]   And I certainly don't wanna push that further.
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:58.520]   So as long as it's somebody without a history of addiction,
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:01.400]   I'm gonna use a benzodiazepine,
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:06.400]   or either commonly called the Z medicines for sleep,
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:09.280]   zolpidem or Ambien or something like that.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:11.080]   - Let's tap into the opioid pathway.
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:12.960]   Gabba, gabba. - Gabba, gabba.
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:15.360]   So I'm probably, I usually start with something
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:17.840]   like Ativan or Klonopin or something like that.
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:20.520]   Probably Ativan 'cause it's shorter acting.
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:23.160]   And again, I'm only looking to use it short-term.
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.080]   I let them know that up front.
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:27.800]   We're looking for three to seven days of decent sleep
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.040]   and then we're gonna try to get them off that medicine.
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:33.660]   And usually people are off to the races
[02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:35.700]   and can sustain it well.
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:39.220]   - A question about hormones.
[02:46:39.220 --> 02:46:44.480]   Many of the Huber and Lab podcast listeners will ask,
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:46.800]   anytime we're talking about something like exercise
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:49.440]   or drug treatment or behavioral treatment,
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.320]   people say, what about the menstrual cycle?
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:55.900]   How is that impacted by this and how does this impact,
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:59.080]   how does the menstrual cycle impact its efficacy, et cetera?
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:04.940]   Carbohydrates and caloric restriction have been implicated
[02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:07.040]   in different interaction,
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:10.260]   are known to interact with the endocrine system.
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:13.400]   So what do you do if you have a patient
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:18.400]   who is depressed or could have psychotic symptoms,
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:20.040]   but let's go with depression
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:23.120]   'cause that's probably a bit more familiar to most people.
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:25.220]   And then they're on a low carbohydrate
[02:47:25.220 --> 02:47:30.220]   or full ketogenic diet, but their menstrual cycles cease.
[02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:33.680]   How do you deal with those adjustments?
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:35.900]   And I guess we could expand this conversation and say,
[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:37.840]   what about male fertility also?
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:41.680]   Because sub caloric diets seem to,
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.280]   my understanding is that sub maintenance caloric diets,
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:52.000]   so weight loss diets will improve testosterone,
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.000]   estrogen ratios in males that are obese,
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.000]   but for someone that's not obese to go on a sub caloric diet,
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.680]   that it can start to impair testosterone levels
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:05.560]   and probably not make, render them infertile,
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:08.900]   but certainly adjust that whole axis.
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:11.920]   So what about interactions between ketosis,
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:16.120]   diets, et cetera, and the endocrine system?
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.660]   - The real answer is I don't think anybody knows
[02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:21.520]   and there's not a one size fits all answer.
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:26.520]   'Cause I've seen examples and I'm aware of science
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:31.580]   to back up the whole or opposite conclusions.
[02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:36.120]   So the first general observation that I'll make,
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:40.360]   I know so many couples, husbands and wives,
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:44.700]   boyfriends and girlfriends, heterosexual couples,
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:48.480]   who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together.
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:49.580]   - And end up with a baby.
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:54.200]   - Almost universally, the men have a much easier time
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:55.440]   with it than the women.
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:49:01.320]   It's not across the board, but I know so many examples
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:05.360]   where the women say, I couldn't tolerate that diet.
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:07.880]   It did not make me feel better.
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:10.320]   It actually made me feel worse.
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.960]   And I think in those cases,
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.800]   it probably does relate to hormones.
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:18.800]   I'm aware of animal models of, you know,
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:23.240]   mice in particular, ketogenic diet and mouse models.
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:25.760]   One researcher shared with me,
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:29.240]   the thing that was striking is that the female mice
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:33.760]   never got pregnant on the ketogenic diet.
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:35.880]   Whereas the mice on the standard diet
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.980]   were just having babies right and left.
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:41.020]   And it was just shocking the difference.
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:45.060]   On the surface, it makes sense.
[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:48.380]   The ketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state.
[02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:53.460]   Women who are trying to reproduce should not be fasting.
[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:57.800]   If your body is in a fasting state,
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:02.480]   it probably does not want to expend resources,
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:07.040]   metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:10.440]   to creating a baby because your very life
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:15.440]   is being threatened by quote unquote fasting or starvation.
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:18.700]   That even though the ketogenic diet
[02:50:18.700 --> 02:50:21.620]   is a sustainable non-starvation diet,
[02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:24.180]   we're really using that diet to trick the body
[02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:29.180]   into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state.
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.440]   And so just from a kind of evolutionary stance,
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.360]   it makes sense that women's bodies
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:39.040]   may actually have significant changes
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:42.520]   in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:45.680]   because a woman should not be having a baby
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:47.740]   when she's starving to death.
[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:54.960]   I know of examples of women who are the opposite though,
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:50:59.960]   who have benefited dramatically and tremendously
[02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:01.640]   from the ketogenic diet,
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:05.240]   have put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full remission.
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:09.020]   And I do actually know of one case, at least one case,
[02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:12.040]   a woman, infertile, she and her husband
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:15.280]   had been trying for three years, no pregnancy,
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:18.660]   she went keto, within four months she was pregnant.
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:22.620]   How do I make sense of that?
[02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:23.600]   I don't know.
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:26.320]   And unfortunately I don't think we really have
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:31.320]   good controlled data on what does the ketogenic diet do
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:36.240]   to male hormonal systems, what does the ketogenic diet do
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:38.400]   to female hormonal systems.
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:44.360]   But clearly I think changes are happening
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:48.440]   and I don't have a way to predict it at least
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:51.360]   if somebody else has great insights, I welcome them,
[02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:53.240]   but I haven't seen them published.
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:56.120]   - It's a terrific answer because when things are
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:57.680]   all over the place and bi-directional,
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:51:59.820]   depending on one circumstance or the other,
[02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:03.280]   I think it screams for controlled studies
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:05.920]   and more descriptions of case studies
[02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:07.400]   and anecdotal data too.
[02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:09.560]   So I think it's an excellent answer.
[02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:12.500]   It also calls to mind the important
[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:14.400]   public service announcement that
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:17.200]   because of these bi-directional effects that you described,
[02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:19.440]   please don't use fasting or the ketogenic diet
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:21.360]   as a reliable form of contraception.
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.080]   - Yes, please don't.
[02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:27.840]   - I have a final question which relates to something
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:32.460]   that is very much starting to get buzz now
[02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:34.560]   and maybe more so for people that hang out
[02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:37.080]   in the Twitter space or the nutrition space.
[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:40.280]   But there's a new class of drugs that I think initially
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:44.020]   were developed to treat diabetes,
[02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:47.900]   but are now being evaluated for their efficacy
[02:52:47.900 --> 02:52:49.400]   to treat obesity.
[02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:54.400]   And these are the semaglutide drugs
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:57.000]   that are involved in,
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.960]   they tap into these glucagon related JLP1 pathways.
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:04.920]   And as is a story that we've talked about
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:06.320]   a little bit on the podcast before,
[02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:07.640]   but many people I imagine
[02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:09.640]   probably haven't heard that conversation.
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:10.800]   I would just simply like to know
[02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:13.480]   what you think about these drugs.
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:17.160]   They obviously adjust the way that glucose and insulin
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:20.960]   are managing energy, both in the body and the brain
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.880]   and can produce weight loss.
[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:25.220]   So that to me, when I look at the data,
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:30.220]   you know, it's impressive, but a good, you know,
[02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:32.700]   a good logical shift in diet and exercise
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:34.240]   could achieve similar weight loss,
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:35.940]   but a lot of people just won't do that.
[02:53:35.940 --> 02:53:37.880]   So the question I have is,
[02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:41.000]   what are your thoughts on semaglutide and other GLP?
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:42.800]   I think I might've said GLT before, excuse me,
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:46.280]   GLP1 related compounds.
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:49.120]   And do you ever prescribe these
[02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:51.520]   in conjunction with these dietary shifts?
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:53.760]   Because it seems to me they would fall right in
[02:53:53.760 --> 02:53:56.360]   with the catalog of other approaches
[02:53:56.360 --> 02:53:57.600]   that you have available.
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:02.000]   - The real answer is I am not at all an expert
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:05.000]   on these medications.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.520]   - But what are your thoughts about them?
[02:54:06.520 --> 02:54:08.400]   I mean, they seem to be weight loss drugs,
[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:11.360]   not unlike the Fen-Fen drugs of the nineties
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:12.320]   that then were banned
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:14.880]   because a few people didn't handle them well.
[02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:19.880]   - They are, and you know, and we had Fen-Fen
[02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:24.160]   and even before that in the 1950s and sixties and seventies,
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:25.240]   Dexedrine.
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:26.320]   - Amphetamine.
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:27.160]   - Amphetamine.
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:28.000]   - Mother's little helper.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.640]   - Was yes, was the treatment of choice for women
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:36.000]   across the United States to keep their slim figures.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.360]   And we created addicts and all sorts of problems,
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:44.000]   but they were widely used in probably millions of women
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.240]   because they work.
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:47.920]   - Because they kill appetite.
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.280]   - They kill appetite.
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:56.760]   My overall thoughts are this.
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:59.560]   There is zero doubt in my mind
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:04.560]   that the obesity epidemic is a threat to human health
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:08.640]   and potentially the human species.
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:11.600]   If it keeps going at the rate it's going,
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:13.960]   it is a threat to our species.
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.680]   We have to figure out what on earth is happening
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:20.200]   and what can we do about it.
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:28.160]   These medications in early studies are highly effective
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:33.160]   over a year or two.
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:35.520]   That's promising.
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:41.520]   I am worried though that we're not attacking
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:43.680]   the root cause of obesity.
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:50.440]   And if the root cause of obesity ends up being some kind
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:55.880]   of poisoning of the metabolic machinery in the brain
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:56:00.760]   or body, and I would argue that probably relates
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:03.800]   to mitochondrial health and mitochondrial function.
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:09.880]   I have every reason to believe that taking a medication
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:14.600]   that helps you lose weight may not be addressing
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:19.600]   that problem, and therefore may not be addressing
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:23.640]   all of the negative health consequences
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:26.080]   of what we call obesity.
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:29.320]   I actually, so obesity in and of itself,
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:33.560]   we know that excess fat can become inflammatory
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:36.280]   and can cause problems in and of itself,
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:40.400]   but I actually see obesity as a symptom.
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:44.480]   I see obesity as a symptom of metabolic derangement
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:49.480]   in the body or brain, and that is why people become obese.
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:52.760]   And that if we're really going to get anywhere,
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:54.920]   we need to identify what is causing
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:56.600]   that metabolic derangement.
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:03.000]   Using a symptomatic treatment like a GLP-1 medication
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:08.000]   to the best of my knowledge is not addressing
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:12.360]   that core problem, and we're just ignoring it.
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:16.000]   Maybe I'll be wrong, and maybe these will be
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.800]   the wonder drug that saved the human species,
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:22.440]   and everybody will be thin and healthy forever and ever.
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:28.920]   I'm not hopeful, 'cause we've had so many promising drugs
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:32.800]   come along, and I'm not sure if we'll be able
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:35.520]   to get FEN-FEN, Dexogen, and other things.
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.560]   We've had so many promising drugs.
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:41.880]   And at the end of the day, when you try to muck
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:46.480]   with human metabolism using a single processed molecule,
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:51.000]   man-made, I can't think of even one example
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:56.000]   where it's been great for large numbers of people.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:02.040]   I mean, certainly manufacturing insulin is life-saving
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:04.200]   for people with type 1 diabetes,
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:06.520]   so that would be an example.
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:09.000]   But giving massive doses of insulin to people
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:12.400]   with type 2 diabetes actually is a downward spiral.
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:16.040]   I would much rather see people with type 2 diabetes
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:19.080]   control their diabetes through diet and lifestyle,
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:21.840]   and that might be a ketogenic diet, or a low-carb diet,
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:25.800]   or exercise, or good sleep, or all of the other things,
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:27.500]   all of it.
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:29.760]   I'd much rather see that, because when people try
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:32.120]   to control their type 2 diabetes with a molecule,
[02:58:32.120 --> 02:58:34.920]   even though it's a natural molecule, insulin,
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:39.560]   we know that that results in really poor health consequences,
[02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:42.160]   results in higher rates of cardiovascular disease,
[02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:44.000]   higher rates of mental disorders,
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.720]   higher rates of premature mortality.
[02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:51.520]   Do I think GLP-1 molecules are gonna be different?
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:54.440]   No, I don't have any reason to think they are going to be.
[02:58:55.440 --> 02:59:00.440]   So that would be buying two cents, but we'll see, time will tell.
[02:59:00.440 --> 02:59:01.680]   - Time will tell.
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:06.200]   Meanwhile, I want to thank you for doing what is,
[02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:08.920]   without question, pioneering work.
[02:59:08.920 --> 02:59:12.200]   I mean, again, I'm not a clinician,
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:15.760]   but I've been around this space long enough
[02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:19.480]   to know that, indeed, there are no wonder drugs, right?
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:22.120]   There are drugs that certainly can help alleviate symptoms
[02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:27.120]   in some individuals, but that lifestyle,
[02:59:27.120 --> 02:59:29.320]   and in case of your work, in particular,
[02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:32.600]   in the discussion today, diet, and the ketogenic diet,
[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:37.600]   in particular, it's clear, can have incredible effects,
[02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:40.200]   miraculous effects in some individuals,
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:43.240]   and positive effects in others that might not be
[02:59:43.240 --> 02:59:44.800]   of the same magnitude, but nonetheless,
[02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:46.800]   are extremely important.
[02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:50.080]   So I, on behalf of myself and the listeners,
[02:59:50.080 --> 02:59:53.240]   and certainly just on behalf of everybody out there,
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:56.080]   because everyone does need to be concerned
[02:59:56.080 --> 02:59:58.800]   about mental health issues, whether or not they have them
[02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:00.960]   in their family, themselves, or otherwise,
[03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:02.640]   because they impact everybody,
[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:04.080]   just really want to thank you for doing the work
[03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:07.360]   that you're doing, because it really is pioneering,
[03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:11.000]   and it's brave, and I can see now,
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:15.520]   based on our discussion, why it would work.
[03:00:15.520 --> 03:00:18.040]   You've given us a lot of hints
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:19.840]   into the underlying mechanisms that suggest,
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:23.320]   as to why it would work, and you've given us examples
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:26.880]   as to how it has worked in patients that you've worked with,
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:29.120]   and this field is expanding fast.
[03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:31.840]   I think this is an area of psychiatry and medicine
[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.400]   in general, meaning behavioral nutritional interventions
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:36.280]   that is expanding very fast.
[03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:40.280]   So thank you for being brave, and for taking this on,
[03:00:40.280 --> 03:00:42.120]   and doing it in such a structured way,
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:44.040]   and for communicating it here today,
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:45.760]   and with the general public through your book,
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:47.000]   and your online presence.
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:48.720]   We will certainly point people in the direction
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:51.080]   of those valuable resources.
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:53.080]   Thanks so much, I really appreciate it.
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:54.840]   - Thank you, Andrew, for being brave,
[03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:57.400]   and having me on here, so, and-
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:00:58.240]   - It's been a pleasure.
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:01.100]   - And for a great conversation.
[03:01:01.100 --> 03:01:02.560]   - Thank you for joining me for my discussion
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:03.980]   with Dr. Chris Palmer.
[03:01:03.980 --> 03:01:06.920]   I hope you found it to be as informative, actionable,
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:09.680]   and exciting in terms of the various treatments
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:12.960]   that we can now think about when considering treatments
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:14.400]   for psychiatric disorders.
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:16.240]   Once again, if you're interested in his work,
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:18.400]   or his new book, "Brain Energy,"
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:19.980]   I encourage you to go to his website,
[03:01:19.980 --> 03:01:21.880]   that's chrispalmermd.com.
[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:24.320]   You can also find the book "Brain Energy" by Chris Palmer
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:26.600]   on Amazon, and other sites where books are sold,
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:28.060]   and we provide links to the book,
[03:01:28.060 --> 03:01:31.200]   and to Dr. Palmer's website in the show note captions.
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.620]   If you're learning from, and/or enjoying this podcast,
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:35.320]   please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:37.840]   That's a terrific, zero-cost way to support us.
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:40.080]   In addition, please subscribe to the podcast
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:43.420]   on Spotify and on Apple, and on both Spotify and Apple,
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:45.600]   you can leave us up to a five-star review.
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:47.740]   If you have questions or suggestions about topics,
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:49.240]   and guests you'd like me to include
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:50.820]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:53.020]   please put those in the comments section on YouTube.
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:54.960]   I do read all the comments.
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:56.980]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[03:01:56.980 --> 03:01:58.680]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:01.020]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:03.520]   During today's episode, we did not discuss supplements,
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:06.440]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:08.120]   we do discuss supplements,
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:10.700]   because while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:12.760]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:14.840]   for things like enhancing sleep, and focus,
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:16.860]   and hormone augmentation, and so forth.
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:18.320]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:19.840]   with Momentous Supplements,
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:22.480]   because they are of the very highest quality,
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:23.920]   and they ship internationally.
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:27.000]   In addition to that, they have single ingredient formulations
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.540]   that allow you to devise the supplement regimen
[03:02:29.540 --> 03:02:32.420]   that's most effective and most cost-effective for you.
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:33.640]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:35.520]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:38.820]   please go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:41.200]   The Huberman Lab also has a zero-cost newsletter
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:42.320]   that you can access.
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:44.800]   It includes summaries of podcast episodes,
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:46.560]   as well as summaries of various protocols
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:49.080]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:50.260]   You can sign up for the newsletter
[03:02:50.260 --> 03:02:52.920]   by going to HubermanLab.com, going to the menu,
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:55.960]   and look for the Neural Network Newsletter signup.
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:02:57.140]   You just provide your email,
[03:02:57.140 --> 03:02:59.540]   and I assure you we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:02:59.540 --> 03:03:01.020]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:02.600]   Again, go to HubermanLab.com
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:04.840]   and sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter.
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:07.360]   And if you're not already following us on social media,
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:10.480]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Huberman Lab on Twitter,
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:12.100]   and Huberman Lab on Facebook.
[03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:13.740]   And at all of those sites,
[03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:16.060]   I provide science and science-related tools
[03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:18.040]   for mental health, physical health, and performance,
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:20.260]   some of which overlap with information covered
[03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:21.780]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:03:21.780 --> 03:03:24.380]   but often which is distinct from information covered
[03:03:24.380 --> 03:03:25.620]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:27.380]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[03:03:27.380 --> 03:03:28.940]   Twitter, and Facebook.
[03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:30.300]   Once again, thank you for joining me
[03:03:30.300 --> 03:03:33.020]   for today's discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer.
[03:03:33.020 --> 03:03:35.200]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:37.040]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:39.620]   [upbeat music]
[03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:41.680]   you
