[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   All right, let's do a call.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.600]   I think we have a call here, Jesse,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.440]   that it's going to set up an even bigger topic I want to discuss.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.960]   Okay, sounds good.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.240]   >> Hi, Kel. My name is Vito.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.520]   I'm an Engineering Manager at a tech company.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.840]   As an Engineering Manager, I have a lot of meetings,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.680]   and my calendar is always full.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.880]   I'm having a hard time controlling this spiraling calendar,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.680]   and I would like to ask you, what do you think I could do?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.600]   I will have a lot of meetings.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600]   It is a part of my job I cannot avoid.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   But right now, I'm having full days with back-to-back meetings,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.040]   and it is often the case that meetings will be scheduled right after one another.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.800]   I do have a good scenario here that I control a lot of these meetings,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860]   and when they happen, and I can reschedule them.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.620]   A lot of them, not all of them, of course,
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.040]   but a lot of them I can.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.320]   So I do have some control over the duration of these calls,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.480]   when do they happen,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.360]   if they meet up against each other or not.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.840]   So I would like to ask you,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.920]   what is your suggestion on controlling this calendar?
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.060]   Should I have a little bit of time between every meeting?
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.000]   Should I schedule a lot of them together so that I have
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.200]   bigger blocks on other parts of my day or maybe other parts of my week?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.100]   Then I have some days full and others not.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.320]   How would you handle a situation where your calendar is full,
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.220]   and you need to have a lot of meetings,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.400]   but you can move them around a little bit?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.960]   What's your take on this?
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.720]   >> Well, I mean, Victor, meeting overload is a perennial problem.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.320]   I think it's a problem that is worse these days than it's ever been before.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.840]   So it's a good excuse to talk about meetings.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.360]   Now, probably the best advice here is to be really weird in an unsettling way,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.480]   but not a way that directly is going to get you fired,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   then people just aren't going to want you in the meetings.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.140]   This is what I'm going to suggest,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.660]   and I think this is going to be the solution to your problem, Victor.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.600]   I want you to come into each of those meetings with a squid on your head.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960]   Don't really mention it.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.780]   Just you come in, you're in the meeting,
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.200]   maybe it smells a little bit weird,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.920]   and then just throughout the meeting,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100]   keep breaking in the volunteer to say,
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.760]   "Can I tell you what I really,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.520]   really hate? Squids."
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.240]   Just keep bringing that up and then someone else will be talking and then just say,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.120]   "Beady eyes, that devilish beak,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.240]   Satan spawn they are.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.680]   Yeah, squids, we could do without."
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.160]   I'm telling you, do this enough,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.080]   the squids on your head,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.040]   maybe sometimes you come in with a fishing rod,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.580]   but you don't talk about it.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.200]   Do this long enough and people will be like, "No, Victor, we're cool.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.520]   We'll email you the notes.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.800]   Don't worry about it.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's unsettling,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.560]   but it's not like an HR violation.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.200]   You're not coming in there and being like,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.040]   "Let me tell you what I hate about people with red hair, it's squids."
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.640]   This doesn't work if your boss is a squid.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.680]   Actually, let's be more serious here.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.640]   I want to use this as an excuse to go through
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.560]   my standard toolbox for taming meetings.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.720]   There's multiple different tools that can be deployed to tame meetings in exactly Victor's situation,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.920]   a situation where you can't just not go to meetings.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760]   Victor is really clear about this here.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.920]   I can't not do these,
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.800]   I can't not do these,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.960]   don't tell me to stop do these,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.840]   I can't not do these.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.960]   Great. A lot of people are in that situation,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.640]   be it in their office or over Zoom,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.880]   but it's lots of meetings.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.920]   I have a toolbox.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.760]   I'm going to give you this toolbox and you can pick and
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.680]   choose which of these things might work best.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.320]   These are all things I've written about before,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.800]   but I'm going to bring them all together.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.760]   I have four ideas to share.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.520]   Idea number 1, meeting buffer.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.280]   The meeting buffer method is all about working with your calendar in a slightly smarter way.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.040]   Here's how it works.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.120]   If you have to set up a meeting and you know how long that meeting is going to be.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.560]   Often meetings have hard stop,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.000]   it's one hour,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.480]   that's the hard stop.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.880]   Don't just block out that hour on your calendar,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.800]   add 15-20 minutes to that block.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.880]   It's not just if the meeting is supposed to be from 1-2,
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.680]   you have 1-2.15 or 1-2.20 actually blocked off on your calendar.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.760]   If your calendar is public,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.040]   everyone sees that as what's blocked off.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.880]   If it's not public, you just treat it like any other meeting.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.240]   I'm next available at 2.15,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.600]   I'm next available at 2.20.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.120]   What you then do with this 15-20 minute buffer period is that is where you process
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.880]   everything that came up in that meeting to get it out of your mind,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.200]   to take the small steps,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.240]   do the small tasks that could be done right away,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.520]   to capture in whatever systems you use,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.640]   the longer term tasks.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.720]   It is how you clear out the mental buffer before the next meeting.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.800]   This is important because its absence can create one of
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.840]   the real killer issues of a heavy meeting schedule,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600]   which is you get into a meeting,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.560]   it generates new obligations and plans and things that's all up there as open loops.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.080]   Then you go straight into the next meeting,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.960]   you haven't dealt with those open loops yet,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.480]   and now new ones are being generated.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.040]   It's very stressful.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.560]   Our minds hates it.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.240]   We want to shut the door on one thing before we move to the other.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   Meeting buffers is going to make you feel 50 percent less anxious about a meeting filled day.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.520]   Small hack goes a long way.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.800]   What I'm going to do here is I go through these tools.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.600]   Each one is going to get a little bit more aggressive,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.960]   a little bit more radical than the one that follows.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.480]   Meeting buffers is number 1.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.360]   Let's now ratchet up the stakes here with tool number 2,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.000]   which is the one for you,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.720]   one for me approach to meeting scheduling.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.960]   Here's how it works.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.120]   If I'm putting a meeting on my calendar,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.480]   I need to then within one week of that date,
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.400]   so let's say five workdays,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.280]   schedule an equal amount of time that is protected time for me to just work without distraction.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.000]   You want to put an hour-long meeting on my calendar for Monday,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.960]   I'm going to find some time on Tuesday where I'm going to break schedule an hour-long work block,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.200]   deep work block for me.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.120]   I don't want to say deep work block, it could be whatever.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.160]   It could be just get my act together,
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   go through my inbox,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.560]   just take a breather and try to organize everything that's going on.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.480]   I don't care what you do in it,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.720]   but it's a non-meeting block.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.000]   One-to-one ratio is the default application of this tool.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Two-hour meeting here,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.400]   I have to find two hours later in the week that I protect.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.520]   When it's on my calendar,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.400]   I treat it as a meeting with myself.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.040]   That time is no longer available for other people to come and take it.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.720]   Now, as other meetings fill into your calendar,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.240]   you might have to try to fit these in elsewhere.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.280]   But what you'll end up with is enforcing a predetermined ratio of meeting the non-meeting time.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.200]   I like the one-to-one ratio,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.400]   one-to-one every minute in a meeting gets a minute of protected time.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.120]   I like that ratio.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.280]   You might use different ratios depending on what you do for a living.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   If you're an executive that is almost always in meetings,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.360]   that's where most of your work happens.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.260]   Maybe it's a two-to-one ratio.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.260]   So for every meeting,
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.120]   you schedule half that length in undistracted time for yourself,
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.520]   somewhere else in your calendar.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   On the other hand,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.080]   maybe if you're in a more concentration forward position,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.560]   it's a one-to-two ratio.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.800]   For every hour of meeting here,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.000]   I'm going to find two hours somewhere else.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But anyways,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.280]   the key here is you're being intentional about what ratio you want your time to be collaborative
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.460]   versus individual concentration.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.760]   And you're taking advantage of the calendar and the social and professional convention
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   around this time is blocked.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.880]   So it's not available to actually enforce that ratio.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.960]   All right,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.360]   idea number three.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.040]   Again, let's ratchet up a little bit.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.520]   Wage war on "standing meetings."
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   Now in academia,
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   this is a killer.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.360]   I think this is a killer in a lot of other places as well.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   It is people who have been assigned,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.120]   okay, we're working on this obligation.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.840]   Here is a project that,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   you know,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.520]   me and Jesse and this other person have been assigned to work on.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.800]   This is an open obligation.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   I'm stressed.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.200]   Like, how am I going to make progress on this?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.600]   I don't listen to Cal Newport.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.400]   So I don't do multi-scale planning.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   What is the easiest thing you can do in that moment to assuage your anxiety about making
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   progress on a project?
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   You say,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   I know what we'll do.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   All right, Jesse.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   All right, other guy.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.120]   Standing meeting.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.040]   Let's just get a meeting on repeat.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.080]   So we know at the very least every week,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   Tuesday at 2.30,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.240]   that we get together on Zoom and we talk about this thing.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.760]   And now I can be like,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.920]   "Hoo, this will be, you know,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   not forgotten because I trust meetings on my calendar."
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.040]   This can completely take over your calendar with all of these different standing meetings,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.720]   one for everything you're working on,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.000]   where the actual amount of useful collaboration that happens is often very little.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.240]   Like, sometimes the meeting is a forcing function for you to do something,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.680]   but it clogs up your calendar.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.160]   It's a big source of calendar congestion.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.320]   So wage war on them.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.560]   Replace standing meetings with much more concrete processes for how you're going to make progress
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.400]   on this specific project.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   So you don't say,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   let's just meet Tuesdays at 2.30.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   You say, well, okay,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.040]   what is the next thing that needs to happen here?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.840]   We need a draft of this client report with some commentary.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   Great.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.000]   Jesse, you have the ball here.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.280]   Write that report.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.600]   You write that draft.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.960]   Once you have a good draft,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.240]   put it into this Google doc in this folder,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   like a shared doc where we can see it.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.120]   Send us a note to say it's ready.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.560]   That will start a 24 hour timer for us to look at it.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.560]   Get it done this week.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.520]   And look, I have a standing office hours on Fridays.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   That will be the time,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.160]   like if I have any big questions,
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.400]   or you have any big questions,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   come meet me there.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   I don't know.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   I'm thinking about this out loud,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.440]   but my point is it's specific and it's concrete.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.320]   What is the next thing that has to happen for this project?
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   Okay.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   Who's doing it?
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   How do they signal they're done?
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   What happens after they're done?
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   How do we get to the next step?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   So it's not just let's meet again next Tuesday.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.120]   It's let's do this specific work
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.520]   and here's how it's going to unfold.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.720]   So replacing standing meetings
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.600]   with concrete project specific processes
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.840]   for how you're going to get to the next step
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.000]   is way more effective than let's just get on Zoom every week
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.680]   and small talk for a while
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.160]   and then kind of make excuses
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.880]   for why we didn't get things done.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.200]   All right.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.480]   So the last thing I want to recommend
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.960]   for waging or tackling meetings,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.520]   ratcheting up again,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.600]   is office hours plus reverse meetings.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.440]   Office hours are great.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.240]   Regular times that you are available.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.360]   This time on these days, I'm always available.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.440]   You can come into my office.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.280]   My phone is on.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.440]   I have a Zoom window open
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.080]   if you're in a hybrid environment.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.440]   No appointment necessary.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.440]   Come grab me.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.720]   That is great on its own.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.880]   It allows, for example,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.800]   small issues to be taken care of
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.400]   without having to have asynchronous
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.640]   back and forth conversations
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.880]   or hold dedicated meetings.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.280]   Just stop by my office hours
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.800]   and we'll chat about it, right?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.640]   That's great.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.920]   But it can be used to implement
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.280]   this more aggressive notion
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.040]   that I call the reverse meetings concept.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.360]   Subscribers to my newsletter
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.840]   have heard me talk about this.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.280]   A little chance for a plug, by the way.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.600]   If you don't subscribe to my newsletter,
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.440]   you should.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.280]   calnewport.com.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.040]   I've been writing that since 2007,
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.440]   roughly one article per week
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   about all the types of stuff I talk about here.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.120]   Plug ended.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   So the reverse meeting concept
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.240]   leverages office hours in a way
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.360]   that I think is quite powerful.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.200]   Here's how it works.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.640]   The standard way meetings unfold is
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.080]   I need your help.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.520]   This three or four people's help
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.640]   on something I'm trying to work on.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.560]   I need some input.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.720]   I need to assign them some tasks.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.000]   The standard thing to do is
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.400]   I'm gonna organize an hour long meeting.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.920]   So now six of us have to give up
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.400]   an hour of our time
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.600]   to come to this meeting
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.320]   so that I can make progress on this thing
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.160]   that I'm trying to work on.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.120]   So that's six total man hours
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.480]   of time obligation generated by a meeting.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.000]   Reverse meetings leverages office hours
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.720]   to significantly reduce that footprint.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.360]   It says, okay, if I need help,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.080]   feedback or assignments from each of you,
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.360]   five or six people,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.080]   to make progress on this meeting,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.840]   I am going to go to each of your office hours one by one.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.960]   I will come to you.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.360]   I'm not gonna force you all to come to me
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.520]   and take this time out of your schedule.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.320]   I'll come to you
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.560]   in time you've already put aside
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.640]   for types of quick discussions.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.480]   And with each of you,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.920]   I'll, hey, what do you think about this?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.800]   Could you take this on?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.600]   Now let's say on average,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.080]   I talk to each of you for 10 minutes.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.360]   Now that's less convenient for me
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   because your office hours might be spread out.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.520]   So I have to take three days
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.280]   and remember to go to talk to each of you.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.360]   The onus is on me.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.520]   I have to do more work.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.040]   But let's look at the total man hour footprint
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.320]   of what just happened.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.480]   Before we had six people spending an hour,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.640]   six total hours of time being taken away
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.200]   from other types of pursuits.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.400]   In this setup, it is significantly less.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   There's me doing 10 minutes with five other people.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.600]   So if we wanna add that up,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.400]   we do 50 minutes times two
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.640]   because it's the time I'm spending,
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.680]   the time you're spending.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.440]   So now we're less than two hours.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.560]   We're closer to an hour and a half total footprint.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.040]   So we've reduced this footprint by a significant amount.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.680]   We have also made the life easier
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.140]   for these other five people.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.320]   Me coming to your office hours,
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.520]   we are already there taking calls
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.480]   and having people coming in
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.000]   and chatting with you for 10 minutes
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.600]   is a no op in terms of an impact on your schedule.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.000]   It was time you'd already set a time for that.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.880]   That's such a less of a injury to your schedule
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.280]   than you having to actually put aside a full hour
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.260]   that you've now lost outside of your office hours
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.380]   to doing this discussion.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.680]   The only person who maybe has to do slightly more work
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.240]   in this is me because I have to coordinate
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.080]   and go to each of you
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.040]   and spread out my meeting over multiple days.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.880]   But you know what?
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.700]   Good.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.960]   It should be harder to call a meeting than it is.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.280]   You know, the person generating the meeting
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.480]   should do more work than the people who have to attend.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.160]   So use office hours as the foundation
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.360]   for doing reverse meetings.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.860]   There's so much that can get organized
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.640]   without having to actually put aside
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.600]   extra bespoke periods of conversation
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.040]   for each individual project
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.420]   that some conversation requires.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.960]   So that's my toolkit.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.120]   Meeting buffers, one to one ratio,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.260]   one for you, one to me on your scheduling.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.280]   Replace standing meetings
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.720]   with concrete progress and process
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.140]   and use office hours to switch from standard meetings
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.800]   to reverse meetings.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.620]   All of those things will really help.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.880]   There you go.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.600]   The great thing about summer for professors, Jesse,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.720]   is meetings go away.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.800]   - No more meetings, baby.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.760]   - No more meetings.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.600]   - And no more meetings for you this fall either, right?
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.940]   - Well, no meetings, some of that's not teaching.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.520]   - Oh, you still have meetings.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.940]   - Yeah, so summertime, I'm off the clock.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.280]   - You still have to go to the meetings.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.080]   - Well, but in like summertime, I'm not a professor.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.920]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.600]   - Yeah, yeah, so like in summertime, I pay my own way.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.560]   I'm on a 10 month salary at Georgetown.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.640]   So I can do whatever.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.160]   This fall, I'm on teaching leave.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.120]   So I don't have to teach, which does save a lot of time,
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.120]   but it's not, it's also just normal academic life
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.760]   still happens, so meetings and this and that.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.000]   And I don't think they're gonna put up with it,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.320]   and rightly so.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.240]   I think we're probably past that period where it's like,
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.520]   I'm just gonna have to zoom into this faculty meeting
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.160]   because, you know, the virus or this or that.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.800]   I think we're probably past those point now.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.060]   Everyone's had COVID three times.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.800]   I think like we're probably gonna be back to
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.880]   you gotta come in.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.760]   You know, the Dean wants to meet with you.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.000]   You're coming to meet with the Dean.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.920]   We're having a faculty meeting.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.720]   You're coming in for the faculty meeting.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.920]   I mean, maybe not, I don't know.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.480]   Academia is slow about that stuff.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.880]   - I think a lot of the other professors
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.960]   were probably pushed back too.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.160]   So you wouldn't be alone.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.280]   - Yeah, well, if anyone asks,
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.500]   I'm incredibly worried about,
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.160]   here's the problem with,
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.680]   I can say I'm incredibly worried about picking up COVID
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.200]   so I can't come to the meetings,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.400]   but we've been teaching in full classrooms
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.240]   for a long time at this point.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.400]   So it's kind of hard to argue that like,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.640]   the thing I'm really worried about
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   is the 20 minutes that's me and you in an office,
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.420]   not the 50 kids that I'm lecturing to.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.840]   But it'll be good.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.680]   I've missed the campus is nice.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.500]   It'll be nice.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.560]   'Cause I build days around it.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.720]   - Yeah, you can get to the gym too.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.000]   - Yeah, I can get to the gym.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.200]   I can work in their libraries.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.080]   It's like a nice change of environment.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.480]   - I mean, it's a sweet campus.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.800]   - It really is nice, yeah.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.020]   (upbeat music)
