[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   *Music*
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Hi everyone. So I'm Beth Glenfield. I actually flew in from Ireland.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500]   So I will try and slow down my accent for everybody.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500]   I have heard that I do get a bit American sometimes.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000]   So yeah, it may not be the Irish accent you're expecting.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   So I'm going to talk to you today about how I believe AI is breaking how we hire technically.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   So I know everyone's very busy, but just a few questions to think about.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Is that okay?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Perfect.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Is, are you using AI today in your recruitment process, both as an interviewee and an interviewer?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.500]   Are you competing against Google or Meta employees, both for positions, but also for candidates?
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   And are you recognizing that lead code puzzles just aren't really up to scratch, like they
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.500]   used to be for knowing if people will build great AI products?
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.000]   So welcome to 2025, where the technical recruitment process is very broken.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And small companies are getting crushed in the talent war.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   So just to refresh our memories, let's look back at what happened over the last 18 months.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   So we had Cluey come to the table and they have raised a 5.3 million round and it is a AI cheating
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   service from a ex-Columbia student.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   And they're currently heading towards 1 million in ARR.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.000]   And we're also seeing 93% LeeCo Wizard success rates for Google and Meta interviews.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And we're seeing like one in three interviews now are having AI assistants.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So really, whenever you're interviewing candidates, you're just interviewing for who has the best
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   AI coding assistant.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.500]   So Sam Altman said this very plainly.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   The technical thing to do is to learn the best AI tools.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   We also saw that Marc Benioff announced that Salesforce will no longer be hiring software engineers
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   this year because, according to them, they have seen a 30% boost in their productivity
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   since they've replaced people with AI.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   I would like to see the data on that.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   But really, jobs have fundamentally changed.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.000]   And you're not just competing on compensation anymore.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.500]   You're competing on brand recognition, career prestige, and perceived stability.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.000]   There's a lot of people being laid off and people are looking for security.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So when a candidate has to choose between your Series A startup and Google's AI division,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   we kind of know what really happens there.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So the candidates you actually want for AI development, the creative problem solvers,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.500]   the collaborative leaders, and the ones who can work with AI instead of being replaced by AI,
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.000]   they are not being optimized for lead code performance.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.500]   Instead, they're building AI tools and using AI libraries.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   They're contributing to open source.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   They are understanding how the business impact will be impacted.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   And that is just not what lead code is indexing for.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:33.000]   So what if instead of asking candidates to solve puzzles that they will never actually use in a job,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   you could observe how they collaborate with AI teammates on actual business scenarios?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.500]   What if instead of measuring their ability to memorize algorithms, you can see how they delegate tasks,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   how they handle ambiguity, and how they deal whenever requirements change mid-sprint?
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.000]   So you're not competing on brand recognition.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You can demonstrate to a candidate at the beginning of a process
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   what your engineering culture is and see how they would perform in your environment.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.500]   So, at Dev Day, we are completely reimagining the technical hiring process in the AI era.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   Here are some examples of what we're seeing today, like I mentioned earlier.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.000]   And then we'll get into what we're considering is the new kind of process you should be looking for
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   in a hiring process.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   What we do instead of getting candidates to code interviews is we create real-life workplace
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   simulations.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Candidates work alongside AI agents with very different personalities.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.200]   You can have the perfectionist, the pragmatist, the security expert, and even the junior developer
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.700]   that needs extensive mentoring, so that now they have to make trade-offs on day-in, day-out situations.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   They're not solving contrived problems.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.700]   They are building features specifically for your business domain.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   So, instead of measuring how they can code, we're actually measuring them on skills that matter.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.700]   How do they collaborate with AI?
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.700]   How do they handle ambiguity?
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   How do they communicate these technical decisions in pull requests, in comments
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.200]   on tickets, and how do they mentor others and adapt when everything changes on a daily basis?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Now, if you do work at Google or Meta, you can just brute force your hiring process.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   You interview 100 candidates, you hire five, and you give them great paychecks.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   But for the majority of companies, we don't have the luxury.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.700]   You cannot afford to make one bad hire, and you can lose up to 20 to 60K in that bad hiring
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.700]   process.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.700]   And you definitely can't afford to hire someone who doesn't know how to ship AI products.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.200]   So, look, the future is coming for us whether we like it or not.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   Mark Zuckerberg says that AI will handle mid-level engineering work by later this year.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   TechCrunch is also reporting that we're wiping out entry-level engineering jobs.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.700]   That doesn't mean fewer engineering jobs.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   They're just very different engineering jobs.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   Jobs that require creativity, collaboration, and the ability to work according to business
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.700]   judgment, and not just code.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.700]   Jobs that require working with AI instead of being replaced by it.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.200]   So, we're currently working with select design partners.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.700]   If you're interested in thinking about this process or learning more or just want to chat
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.200]   about how you're thinking about hiring, let me know.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   My details are on the screen or just come find me at the event.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Thank you.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.700]   Thank you.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.700]   Thank you.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.880]   We'll see you next time.
