[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   Let's go through this.

[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   but at least I can read the Washington bankruptcy exemptions. So the first thing, the most important thing with a homestead. Real property or a mobile home up to $40,000 of equity is protected under Washington bankruptcy exemptions.

[00:30:43.400 --> 00:31:13.420]  ,
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:13.420]   and then we want to be cautious about all of a sudden having a student loan.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:13.420]   So if she has been previously living rent free and it doesn't have was assumed she doesn't have any money in a bank account or anything like that, then she would have to be protected under the law.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:13.420]   So if she has been previously living rent free and it doesn't have was assumed she doesn't have any money in a bank account or anything like that, then she would have to be protected under the law.
