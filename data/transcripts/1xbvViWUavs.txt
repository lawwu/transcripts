[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   When you look at how most people sit, walk, and do their "exercise," resistance training
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   and/or cardiovascular, hopefully, and cardiovascular training, what are some of the most common
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600]   problems that you see?
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.120]   Is it imbalance, like leaning to one side?
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.680]   Is it that their bodies are trained into asymmetry?
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.200]   Is there any way to kind of, you know, mass-diagnose everybody all at once in this first question?
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640]   Let me borrow a couple analogies from one of my favorite people, Katie Bowman.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.880]   And first thing is, she will point out, and it's not a perfect analogy, so bear with us,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.720]   is this notion of mechanotransduction, which means that at a cellular level, your tissues,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.960]   some of your tissues specifically, need mechanical input to express themselves.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.680]   You want a strong tendon?
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680]   How do you get a strong tendon?
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.160]   You have to load it, right?
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.880]   Does it do tendon things?
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.480]   Is it lengthening under load?
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000]   Does it express shortening under load?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.880]   Does it do isometric holds?
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.860]   So we can start at that level.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.040]   She points out that if you put a—and again, not a perfect analogy, but if you put an orca
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.880]   into captivity, over a while, that orca fin will start to fold over.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.320]   Folded fin syndrome, it's nicer than floppy fin syndrome.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.800]   That's hurtful.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.080]   And what you're doing is when you alter the environment that this amazing animal lives
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.280]   in, it's not swimming, it's not fighting, it's not hunting, you're not loading the base
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.360]   of that fin.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.200]   And so what happens is that collagen breaks down, and we start to see changes in that,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.760]   in that expression of that.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.520]   So what we can start to say is, again, not romanticizing the Pleistocene era when human
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:51.400]   beings were paleo, but what is it that we need in our daily dose lives to maintain the
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.120]   integrity of our tissue systems?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.280]   Exposure, so that our brain says, "This is safe," so that you actually have tendons and
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.840]   ligaments that can do what tendons and ligaments can do, and fascia that can be springy.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.440]   If—borrow another sort of Katie Bowman-ism—if we have a movement language, an actual language
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.760]   made up of words, how many words are you using today?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.880]   And most of us aren't using that many words, so very few words.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.980]   So I sit, I stand, I walk very slowly, I sit, I stand, I walk very slowly.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.960]   So everything is just in those few—and then I go exercise, using the same words, I'm on
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   the exercise bike, right, I'm on an elliptical, which doesn't actually ask me to have any
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   hip extension, and suddenly you can see that our movement language, which we're really
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.280]   codifying under intensity, load, right, we're becoming very competent in these adaptation
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   positions.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   Sitting.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   What ends up happening?
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   Well, we start to see that our bodies are adaptation machines, and they just begin to
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   adapt.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.800]   And so suddenly what we have is a human body that doesn't express normative range.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.720]   The brain may not think that that range is even safe and put there.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.940]   Then we start to sort of minimize the movement choices that the brain has, the movement options
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.320]   that the brain has.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.100]   So really the question is, you know, at low loads—let's establish things.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.080]   At low loads and low speeds, you can get away with everything.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   Why?
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   Because this body is rad.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.660]   And it's designed—it's durable, it's not fragile, it's designed to be ridden hard and
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.240]   put away wet for a long time.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.560]   Remember when you were 17, would cut off your hand, it would grow back the next day, right?
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   You would.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.880]   Think about the falls you took skating.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.120]   And you'd be like, "Oh, that sucked," and the next day you put your shoulder back in,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.040]   you just kind of respawn.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.760]   So what is it that we need to put into our movement diet?
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.240]   And then we can start to separate out, should that be exercise or should that be movement?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   And now the real filter that we should be beginning these real and earnest conversations
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   about is, what is it in the environment, given that I'm a busy working person, and maybe
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.840]   I have some agency in the morning, and maybe I have some agency in the afternoon, but let's
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.680]   take exercise out of it.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.640]   The one-hour discreet, working on zone two cardio, working on my evidence-based practice,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.440]   what should I be doing the rest of the time?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.240]   So for example, one of the things that we're huge fans of in the evening is sitting on
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   the ground for 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.240]   In what?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   Cross-legged?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   Yes.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   Squatting?
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   Yes.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   Long sit.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   Side saddle.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   90-90.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   Any time you need to fidget, fidget.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.200]   And what you'll see is you start to accumulate exposure, which I think in my worldview is
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.720]   the first order of magnitude in problem-solving is how do we have the human be exposed to
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.160]   the thing we're trying to change or improve or restore normative ranges.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.480]   So that would be in the evening, just getting down on the floor?
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.260]   Yeah, that behavior alone cultures that toilet on the ground, sleep on the ground.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.760]   We start to see fall risk in our elderly populations attenuate to zero, approximate zero.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.980]   Lower hip OA, lower low back OA, and it may just be that we're using and touching some
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.100]   shapes and our bodies are saying, "Hey, let's just keep that around.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.960]   Let's normalize what the hip should be able to do."
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.880]   In terms of your connective tissue, think about the idea here is that we're loading
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.600]   you passively, actively, whatever, that you're saying to your brain, this is a quote from
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.080]   one of my PT instructors.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   And this is really important.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.000]   If people take this away, they should listen to this.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.280]   Muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.800]   At no age, do you stop adapting?
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.400]   At no age, do you stop healing?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   Those things slow down.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.920]   It's a little bit harder to have the same adaptation we did.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   We weren't in full-fledged puberty, but you can always adapt.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.360]   In the first order of business, if you spend 20 or 30 minutes sitting on the ground, you're
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.760]   going to start to see that hamstrings start to feel better.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   My hips start to feel a little better because I'm just spending time in these ranges and
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.680]   my body's going to start to adapt as I increase my movement language.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.560]   Would you extend what you just said to, like if somebody has a hardwood floor and maybe
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   a little low-pile rug or something like that, and they're going to watch a podcast or a
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.520]   movie or a show in the evening, they stretch out on their belly, like sort of up dog or
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.600]   cobra or whatever it's called.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.640]   So basically any kind of movement where you're on the ground, any kind of squatting, and
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   maybe they start to stretch a bit here and there.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.720]   Oh, so now we're into the real magic, the behavior.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.200]   Where are we going to stack these behaviors?
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.120]   So if you have to get up and down off the ground, plus one, right?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.840]   I got to get up and down off the ground every day.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.080]   So if you're an older person who may hasn't gotten off the ground, I'm older, I'm just
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.900]   talking about over 50, you may not have gotten up and down off the ground for 100 years.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.720]   You just don't do it anymore, right?
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.960]   We want to hear why I think MMA is so amazing.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.440]   You have to get up and down off the ground a lot, right, if you go to Jits, right?
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.480]   How about yoga?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   How about Pilates?
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.440]   You're like, wow, there's a lot of time organizing on the ground.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.560]   So a lot of people, Ida Rolf really said, hey, how do we help the person organizing
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.640]   gravity first and foremost, right?
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.540]   Then we have someone like Phillip Beach, who is this incredible, he wrote this book on
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.080]   functional embryology, which I highly recommend, called Muscles and Meridians, I think, Muscles
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.320]   and Meridians.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.580]   But his hypothesis is that one of the ways that the body tunes itself is by being on
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.580]   the ground.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.640]   Again, restoring native ranges, re-approximating joints, right, kneeling, walking, and if you
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.600]   just took a step back and said, what's it look like for the last 10,000 years, you know?
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.360]   When have we, 10,000 years ago, my understanding is that I'm a little fatter, your femur's
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.620]   a little longer, but we're pretty much the same people.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.180]   Maybe I don't digest milk yet, maybe that's the understanding.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.760]   But ultimately, what behaviors have changed, we're off the ground.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.800]   And so this is an easy, don't need any equipment, can drop this in, I can answer my emails,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.520]   watch TV.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.120]   That seems like how we're going to improve and be able to start to untangle this very
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.860]   complex score, not when people have a lot going on.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.780]   I love this.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.600]   And as you pointed out, sorry, the roller's already there.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.440]   So you're sitting there and the roller's there, another barrier to adherence knocked out.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.460]   So you're like, oh, I might as well just, what's stiff today?
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.460]   What hurts today?
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.880]   How could I have some self-soothing input?
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.440]   And when we're working at high levels of performance, like the highest levels, these range of motion,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.920]   like keeping you being able to access the full sort of arsenal of what you can do with
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   your body, this movement solutions, sort of like Ido Portal plus the Olympics, right?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.400]   You would see that this is an easy way for our elite athletes to work and integrate without
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.360]   having to do another thing.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   So what I'm getting here is that everybody, regardless of age, should get down on the
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.600]   ground once a day and get up off the ground at some point.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.520]   And you can use whatever you want to help you get up and down off the ground.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.920]   So for those who are listening, you're like, I can't do that.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.520]   You know, there's a test we write about in the book that if you just do crisscross applesauce
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.280]   standing, you should be able to lower yourself to the ground and stand back up without using
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   your hands.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.080]   Cross the feet just for those that are just listening, cross the feet and then just slowly
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080]   lower yourself.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   That's right.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   Don't collapse.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.520]   Just lower yourself to the ground.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.200]   And then without putting your hands down or knee down, can you stand back up?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.720]   And should one be able to do it with either foot over the other?
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.960]   Seems like I should use my left leg and right leg equally, right?
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.160]   I shouldn't have a good side and a bad side.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.400]   But what's interesting is the data I think is that, like, it's a nice predictor of all
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.200]   cause mortality, morbidity.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.320]   That's fine.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.640]   But what it really hints at is your changes in how your body interacts with the environment.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.480]   That because you've adapted, suddenly the skill that you've done 100,000 times, 200,000
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.200]   times as a kid in crisscross applesauce, you suddenly are confronted as an adult with a
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.680]   skill you can no longer perform.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.960]   And it doesn't require massive hip range of motion.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.640]   It doesn't require full range of motion in your ankles.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.080]   It's actually a really fair test.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.560]   But if you're missing some of these end ranges, you're going to struggle.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.880]   And it's nice now that I have this, like, what's the session cost?
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.600]   I've become a-- I love cycling.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   Mountain biking's my jam.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.880]   But if I ride my bike a ton, my hips get super tight.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.680]   But if I have some assessments, just like vital signs, blood pressure, 120 over 80,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   that's not good blood pressure.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   But it's a nice, decent reference.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.840]   Now I create some movement minimums that help me understand how my body's interacting with
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:30.560]   stress, environment, nutrition, exercise, et cetera.
