[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.760]   found in the book of the Prophet Isaiah in the first chapter and the fourth
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.280]   verse. The fourth verse in the first chapter of the book of the Prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:29.400]   Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.760]   that are corrupters. They have forsaken the Lord. They have provoked the Holy One
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:49.080]   of Israel to anger. They have gone away backward. Ah sinful nation, a people laden
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:59.280]   with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters. They have
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.800]   forsaken the Lord. They have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger. They have
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.280]   gone away backward. Now those who attend here regularly will know that we are
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.520]   studying at this present time this message of the book of the Prophet Isaiah
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.280]   and in particular his introduction of his theme and of his matter as he
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.360]   presents it to us here at the very beginning of this first chapter. I would
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.720]   remind you that he wrote to these people at all because they were in trouble and
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.680]   were in difficulties. None of the prophets would ever have appeared or
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.720]   ever have written if everything had been going well. It was because things were
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.200]   going badly and going wrong that the prophets ever were called upon by God to
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.680]   address the nation at all. So it is the message of God through the prophet to
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.140]   the nation of Israel in trouble and in difficulty and in perplexity. But it's
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.560]   important and vital that we should realize always that these particular and
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.800]   special messages to the nation of Israel are in a sense God's message to the
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.960]   whole world. God made the whole world, made man for himself. So as he addresses
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.440]   this particular message we have as it were the message that he addresses to
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.680]   the whole world of men, to the whole of humanity. The principles are the same.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.120]   There are particular applications but I'm not concerned about them at the
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.640]   moment. I'm concerned about the great principles which are enunciated in the
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.280]   message that was given by God to the prophet in this way and manner. And it's
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.000]   of course exactly the same message as was given to all the other prophets. What
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.360]   is it? Well it comes to this. The prophet has got two big things to say. The first
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.600]   is he tells the people the cause of their troubles. That's the starting point
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.920]   always. You can't treat a condition unless you know what it is. Now the world
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.680]   is always interested in cures but you can't get it that way. You've got to know
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.360]   what's wrong with you. So all the prophets start by a great message of exposure of
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.760]   the trouble, exposure of the ills. And it is only after they've done that that they
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.840]   come to the second aspect of their message which is their enunciation of
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.200]   the only, the one and only remedy, the one and only cure. Now that's exactly what
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.980]   Isaiah's got to say, what they've all got to say. That's what the New Testament
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.440]   preachers say. There are only two sides to the message of the Bible. It is
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.240]   primarily a call to repentance and then it is a call to faith. The Apostle Paul,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.080]   you remember in bidding farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus there on
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.840]   the seashore, reminded them how he had gone from house to house and in public
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.520]   and he preached what? The repentance that is toward God and the faith that is
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.720]   toward the Lord Jesus Christ. That's it. And that's what you've got here. It's
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:25.240]   everywhere. Now I am arguing therefore that this is precisely the message of
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.320]   God and his word this very night to this world in which we live. The world's in
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:40.080]   trouble. The whole world is in trouble and individuals are all in trouble. And
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.640]   the first thing we have to realize is what's the matter? What's the cause of
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.720]   the trouble? Now the Bible insists upon our facing this. We've got to follow its
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.440]   teaching therefore as it unfolds to us and unmasks before us our actual state
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.120]   and condition and the cause of it. And so you see Isaiah immediately proceeds to
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.480]   do that. First of all he gives us an account of what we may call the general
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.280]   characteristics of this thing that causes all our troubles which the Bible
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   calls sin. And sin he has told us in its essence in verse 2 is a wrong
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.680]   relationship to God. "I have nourished and brought up children and they have
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.760]   rebelled against me." That's the first cause of all our troubles. If man had
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.160]   never originally broken that relationship between himself and God
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.640]   there would never have been trouble in the world. That is sin, the essence of it.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.400]   Rebellion against God. But he doesn't leave it at that. So he goes on as we saw
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.800]   last Sunday night in the third verse to show us some further characteristics of
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.000]   this rebellion. Why does man ever rebel? Why does he do this? And there you
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.400]   remember he told us it's because of the blindness of men. Sin makes a man blind.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.100]   Can't think, can't reason, doesn't consider. Makes a fool of him also. Makes a
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.340]   pervert of him also. And prevents his knowing what is good for him. Now that's
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.540]   the point at which we've arrived. There as it were are the general
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.460]   characteristics of this condition called sin which is making the world what it is
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.240]   tonight. People have this curious notion that the gospel and its message are
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.120]   remote. They think that a preacher should be talking politics the whole time. What
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.700]   an utterly short-sighted view that is. What we are meant to do here is to show
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.040]   you the thing behind politics, behind all your social and economic troubles. That's
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.620]   the thing that matters. All these agencies are failing. Why? Well because
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.400]   they're all being handled by men who are sinners. Sin is the cause of the trouble.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.480]   You can't put this world right by politics or by any other arrangement you
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.080]   may think of. There's only one basic trouble. It is sin. And there are the
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.440]   general characteristics of sin. This is the explanation of why the world is
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.760]   divided into two great camps tonight. And why they're piling up armaments. And why
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.200]   we are faced with dread and unthinkable possibilities. That's the trouble with
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.600]   the world. It's only here you get a radical diagnosis. You don't get it in
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.920]   your newspapers. You don't get it anywhere else. Here and here alone is the
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.480]   radical explanation. Very well. But you see the Prophet doesn't stop at that. He
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.320]   goes on. And we've got to follow him. If you want to be healed my friend in a
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.400]   spiritual sense, in other words if you really want to get right. If you want to
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.000]   master life and want a victory in your own life. If you want to be able to look
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.600]   into the face of death without fear. Well then listen I say for your very life.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.880]   Follow this man. He's given us the general characteristics of sin. Let's
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.520]   follow him as he leads us on to see some of the things that this condition leads
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:20.360]   to now in action, in practice, in conduct, in behavior. That's what we've got in
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.200]   this fourth verse that we are looking at together this evening. Now again you
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.900]   notice that this element of the enormity of sin and its baseness comes out once
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:41.120]   more. And what he's going to tell us here tonight is a kind of inevitable
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   consequence of what we've already been looking at. Are you interested in logic?
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.400]   Well follow this logical process here. See how he traces it out. How one thing
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:59.360]   leads to another. This is what you may call if you like the anatomy of sin. It's
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.760]   a kind of system. It's a kind of body. So you start at the beginning and you work
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:11.280]   it out. That's exactly what the Prophet is doing. You can't be in this wrong
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.640]   relationship to God. You can't have this wrong feeling as it were without it
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.600]   showing itself in certain ways. That's what he's going to show us. Now it's
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.640]   interesting to notice the way that he introduces it to us. He puts it before us
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:39.240]   by means of the word "Ah sinful nation." What's that mean? Well he's expressing
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:45.840]   his sense of wonder, his sense of astonishment, his sense of anger, his
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:55.080]   sense of grief, his sense of shame. He looks on at his own nation, remembering
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.040]   who and what they were. Israel, the people of God, the people whom God had made for
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.120]   himself as God made men at the beginning. He made this nation for himself. He made
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.600]   man out of nothing. He made this nation as it were out of nothing. There was only
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.640]   one man, Abram. He turned him into a nation. God made this nation. It's his own
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:21.680]   as he made men for himself. But Isaiah looks on at the nation. And what can he
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:30.400]   do but shake his head and say, "Ah, what a tragedy. What a perversion. What an
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.040]   enormity. What a sight." We've seen already how he's called heaven and earth to
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.880]   witness to this. We have seen how he's even produced the ox and the ass to
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:47.720]   express their amazement. And now he expresses his own amazement. What he's
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   saying in effect is this, "Is it possible that the Israel of God should come to
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.240]   this?" And that I translate into our more general terms by putting it like this.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   What he's asking us to look at and to consider is this. Is it possible that men
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.160]   created in the image of God should be what we see in the world before us this
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:16.200]   evening? But such is the case. And if you begin to understand these things, if
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.860]   you've got any real conception of what man was when he came out of the hands of
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.520]   God and see what he is now in the depth of his evil and iniquity, there's only
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:34.360]   one thing to say and that's, "Ah, wonder and amazement, shame and grief and
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:42.840]   astonishment. What a terrible thing sin is." Now my dear friends, let's ask
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.720]   ourselves a question or two as we go along.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:58.180]   What's your reaction to the state of the world? Are you astonished at it? What's
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.100]   your reaction to what is going on before your eyes and is so popular and so
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.680]   acclaimed by men? How do you react to it? When a man has a real insight and
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.120]   understanding, says Isaiah, he's almost rendered speechless. What can you say? He
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:22.160]   can but hold up his hands in horror. Are we doing that? The whole business of the
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.200]   Bible, the whole business of preaching, is to bring us to see that. We've got to see
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.120]   things as they are. They need to be unmasked. Our eyes must be open to them
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.760]   and then we'll have the same astonishment as possessed the Prophet
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.240]   before us. Now then, what is he astonished at? Well, I say he's astonished at the
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.680]   terrible character of sin and he's astonished at what it does. Well, what
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.320]   does it do? Well, let me try and summarize the lesson of this fourth verse this
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.080]   evening by putting it under three headings, three principles. Sin, he says,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:06.560]   is that which makes a man forsake the Lord and go backwards. Sin is that which
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:16.440]   makes a man despise the Holy One of Israel. Now let's look at this. Here it is.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:26.640]   They have forsaken the Lord. They have provoked, despised, so as to provoke the
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:36.240]   Holy One of Israel. They have gone away backward. I wonder that we catch
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.480]   something of the significance of this extraordinary statement. What sin really
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.880]   does is to make a man despise the Almighty and everlasting and eternal God
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:56.640]   and all that belongs to him. Why is the world as it is? Well, the world is exactly
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.800]   like the prodigal son. Here was a young man, will you remember, according to our
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.640]   Lord's parable, who was one of two sons, brought up by his father, obviously a
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:13.080]   wonderful man, a kind and loving and considerate man, beautiful home,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.480]   everything that was necessary, nothing ever denied. But you see, this younger
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.320]   son, he begins to think to himself that this isn't so wonderful after all, neither
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.520]   is his father so wonderful. And he gets tired of that way of life. He says, "I'm
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.720]   getting out of this." He thinks there's something better in some far country.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.280]   He's been hearing stories about it. Somebody's come and told him and told
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.240]   others some wonderful stories. Only you get there. Oh, this is nothing. You still
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.800]   remain a baby here. You're under your father's thumb. That's the life. That's
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.680]   the life. And so, you see, he decided to leave and to go. He forsook his father. He
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.760]   left his home. Away he went. That's what Isaiah is telling us that children of
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.480]   Israel had done. That is what men did, you know, in paradise. God made him in his
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.400]   image and put him there in the garden. There he is in paradise. That's his home.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.940]   And God the Father comes down and visits them and talks to them. And everything is
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.400]   there. He had to pick the fruit. He didn't have to earn his bread by the sweat of
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.640]   his brow. He hadn't to contend with thorns and thistles and briars. There it
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:29.920]   was. That was the home. But what man has done, according to the Bible, and what men
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:38.840]   persist in doing, is to leave that. He forsakes his father and his home. And
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.600]   everything that is true of that father and everything that is true of that home,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:50.320]   he despises it. Now, this is the thing, of course, that mankind doesn't realize. But
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.160]   it's the thing that the Bible says from beginning to end. The carnal mind, says
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.840]   the Apostle in Romans 8, 7, is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:07.880]   God, neither indeed can be. What is this carnal mind then? Well, it's self-will. It
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.800]   is forsaking God as a person and God and his laws and everything that his kind of
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:22.160]   life stands for. Oh, how necessary it is that we should realize this. You see, we
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.560]   are much too much in a hurry always to get onto particular sins. But sin is much
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:34.760]   more important than sins. There'd be no trouble about sins were it not for sin.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:42.680]   The ultimate sin is a man's attitude towards God, a wrong attitude towards God.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:49.000]   Let me put it again. Man was made in the image of God and he was meant to glorify
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.280]   God and he was meant to enjoy God. That's what he was for, and to delight in God.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.600]   But what is mankind doing? Well, it's repeating what was done at the beginning.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:07.360]   It ceased to do so. Man was ready at the beginning to query and to question and
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.840]   to listen to the suggestion of the devil. Hath God said what right has God to say?
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:23.000]   So, you see, the wrong attitude to God comes in. Man no longer glorifies God. He
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.400]   no longer enjoys God. He's forsaken God. And of course, he's contradicting himself
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   because man, in sin and as the result of the fall, is always so anxious to get to
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.360]   the highest circles, to meet the top people, and to get to the very head and
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.720]   fountain. That's his great ambition. He's always climbing to get to know important
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:55.840]   people. And yet he's turned his back upon God. He's forsaken the Holy One of Israel.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:03.880]   He has despised the companionship of the Lord of Glory. He thinks he knows of
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.140]   someone better and something better. So, you see, he starts like that, with the
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.980]   person, with God himself. And then, of course, it proceeds to doing the same
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:24.600]   thing with God's laws and God's way of life and God's commandments. God who made
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.360]   us, God as our Father in that sense, obviously had planned a certain kind of
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.320]   life for us. And as I've reminded you, it was meant to be a very happy, a very joyous,
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:41.200]   a holy kind of life. Man was made upright. Man was made innocent. There was no
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.400]   sin in him. There was no darkness. There was no evil. There was no pain. There was
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.560]   no sorrow. There was nothing unworthy. Man was made perfect. And he had this
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.440]   original righteousness. The righteousness, as it were, that is a part of God's own
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.160]   being. It was in man, this original righteousness. And he was meant to live
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:07.800]   that kind of life, a pure life, a holy life. No trickery, no chicanery, no
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.240]   backbiting, no jealousy, no envy, nothing dark, nothing hidden, everything open,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.720]   everything plain, everything pure, everything true, everything noble,
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.840]   everything uplifting. Man was meant to live that sort of life. And God put him
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.080]   into a position to live it. There's the home into which man was born, as it were,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:34.640]   with the Father in the center. But man, first of all, despises his father and
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:44.120]   then he despises the home and everything that is true concerning it. Instead of
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:52.040]   living as God had planned him to live, he begins to despise these things. One of
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.240]   his commonest jokes is about the religious life. "Goodie, goodie," he calls it, "narrow."
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.360]   These are his terms and his epithets. The world tonight is sorry for people like
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.000]   you and myself in a place like this. Hot at times. Look at that, this fancy
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.200]   doing that. It despises it. It ridicules it, laughs at it. Everything that belongs to God.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:20.840]   You see, man begins to put his own ideas instead of God's ideas. There it is, the
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:26.200]   natural mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God. Neither
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.440]   indeed can be. God has given us the Ten Commandments. He says, "That's how to live.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.640]   Start by honoring me and having me alone as your God. Don't take my name in vain.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.280]   Don't take my day in vain. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.480]   commit adultery. Thou shalt not bear false witness. That's how I want you to
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:51.800]   live," says God. "That's how I mean you to live." And man in sin says, "What a life.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.480]   What pleasure is there in living a life like that, narrow? Not allowed to kill. Not
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.280]   perhaps actually physically, but not allowed to kill people with your mouth.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.320]   Not allowed to denounce people and to be indulged in backbiting. Not allowed to
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.160]   commit adultery. What a life, hardly worth living. This is life." You see, they
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.480]   despise God and his laws and all his ways, and everything that is
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.640]   characteristic of the home into which God put men at the
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.080]   beginning. Well, I say, instead of accepting God and his laws and his ways
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.560]   and his commandments, man puts forward his own ideas, his own thoughts, his own
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:38.280]   way of life, and then he proceeds to live it. Now, all I'm trying to show you, my
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.720]   dear friends, is that as men did that at the beginning and brought calamity upon
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.600]   the whole cosmos and has bequeathed that to his progeny, so it is the essence of
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.440]   the trouble in this world at this very moment. The world is as it is tonight
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:02.840]   because mankind is still forsaking God and everything that he stands for.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:11.400]   Forsaking his ways, doing it deliberately, turning from him, forsaking, refusing to
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:18.800]   listen, laughing at it, walking away from it, going as far as it can from it.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:26.920]   Isn't that the whole position we are confronted by this evening? Isn't the
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:33.000]   world glorying in its attitude towards God, its wrong attitude, its base attitude?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.880]   Doesn't the world think tonight that it's clever in ceasing to be religious?
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.760]   Doesn't every adolescent almost pass through that phase of thinking it's
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   wonderful not to believe in God, not to believe in his laws, and that you get
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.720]   freedom and emancipation by so doing? Isn't that instinct in all of us? That's
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:58.400]   the result of sin, you see. We always think we know better. There's always some
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.880]   wonderful country far away, a far country, that's the place to get to. Not this
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.240]   chapel business, not this religion, not this Christianity, not this God, all that
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.800]   belongs to the past. There's the life, let's get to it. So they forsake God and
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.120]   his holy way and his life and everything that characterizes what he has prepared,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:25.160]   and off they go. Yes, but we are reminded here that it is always a going backwards.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:35.680]   They have gone away backward. That's the biblical answer to evolution. The world
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.200]   thinks it's going forward. The world thinks it's going upwards. Never. The
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.760]   world as it goes from God goes backwards. This is of necessity too, isn't it? People
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.720]   talk about going up to London. Doesn't matter where you live, you go up to
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.760]   London. You don't go down to London, you go up to London. Why? Capital City. There's
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.100]   nothing above, there's nothing higher. You go up to London, and my dear friend, you
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.240]   go up to God, and if you turn your back on him, you're going down, you're going
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:16.120]   backward. You go, I say, from the Supreme Being, the Creator of the ends of the
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:25.800]   earth, the Holy One of Israel. You turn your back upon him, and you leave his
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.000]   home, you leave the place into which he's put you, you leave his holy laws, you
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   leave his way of life, and you assert what? Yourself, your opinion, and the
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.880]   opinion of the clever fellows who write to the newspapers and appear on the
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.480]   television screen, the clever men. You put them before God. That's what you've
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:59.320]   done, says Isaiah. Is it surprising? He says, ah, sinful nation, madmen, fools.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:09.600]   Leaving God, leaving holiness, leaving heaven as it were, and following your own
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:17.160]   devices and ideas. Well, let's leave it at that. There's the first thing he tells us.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:24.200]   This terrible thing called sin makes men do that. But then look at it, it's shown
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.720]   in this second principle even still more clearly. Look at the type of life that it
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.480]   leads them to after they've forsaken that. You see, life's a journey, isn't it?
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:41.240]   This process of sin, it's a journey. You leave home first, well, then you go
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.640]   somewhere. Well, you go somewhere, as I say, because you think it's so much
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.960]   better, it's so much more wonderful, the prospects are so great there. Well, let's
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.160]   see where you arrive, let's see where they go. And here's the answer. Sinful
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.120]   nation, people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.200]   corrupters. They have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.560]   into anger, they have gone a way backwards. To what? Well, to that. That's
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:14.440]   where they go, that's what they become. Now you see what the Prophet is putting
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.600]   before us is this. He's doing everything he can to open the eyes of his
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.800]   contemporaries. There they are in trouble and it's going to be worse, but they
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.520]   can't see it. He preaches to them, others preach to them, they remonstrate with
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.620]   them, but still they won't listen. He says, "Look, what can I do to make you see
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.580]   what you're doing? Look here," he says, "here's the picture, that's what you've
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.760]   left. Where have you gone to? What's this thing you've got?" And here he paints it
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   before them. And he uses terms which make it quite plain and clear to us that they
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.240]   really enjoy this which they've taken up. You notice what he says, "There are
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.640]   sinful nations, there are people laden with iniquity." That means they have really
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.980]   gone into it thoroughly. They've gone into it thoroughly because they think
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.520]   it's very wonderful. They're absolutely laden, they haven't been playing with it,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.480]   they haven't just touched it, they're absolutely laden with iniquity. And all
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.720]   these other things that are so true of them. And if this doesn't make us see the
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:20.440]   enormity and the perversity of sin, well, what can do so? If only the world saw
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:27.400]   tonight what it's doing. If the world could only see what it's really gloating
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.240]   in, and enjoying, and bursting of, and then consider what it left for the sake
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.840]   of that, it would repent immediately. And that's what happens to every man who does
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.600]   repent. He comes to himself like the prodigal. He sees what a fool he is. He
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.920]   says, "What am I doing in this far country with the husks and the swine? I, who used
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.760]   to be there." That's exactly what happens when a man is convicted of sin and
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.440]   repents and becomes a Christian. But let's follow it in terms of the way in which
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.240]   Isaiah puts it. Now you see what I'm trying to say to you is this, that until
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.560]   a man sees himself as he is in that far country, he'll never come back, he'll
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.360]   never believe the message. So you've got to see it. Here's the first thing he
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.680]   tells us about this life which men take up after they've forsaken God. It's a life
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:20.040]   of sin, he says. What is sin? Well, sin is defined as transgression against divine
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:28.240]   law, or against principles of morality. And that's a very good definition of it.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   Sin is transgression against divine law. Sin is deliberately breaking God's law.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:46.080]   Sin is doing what God has told you not to do, and doing it quite deliberately. The
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.480]   commandment says, "Thou shalt not." Man says, "I will," and he does it. That's sin. The laws
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.240]   of God are perfectly plain, my dear friends. There's no need to argue about
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.520]   this. Is there anybody here tonight who really wants to defend killing and
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.280]   adultery and all these things? Of course there isn't. The morality even of
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.480]   primitive peoples condemn such things. But over and above it all is the law of
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:23.360]   God. Yet man deliberately transgresses it. Sin is the transgression of the law. It
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.960]   is man looking at the law. He says, "There's the law of God. Is it there are your ten
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   commandments? Right. I'll spit on them, and then I'll stamp on them." And he does it
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:43.280]   deliberately, and he gluts in it as he does it. Sinful nation. The next term he
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:49.240]   uses is the term iniquity, a people laden with iniquity. What's iniquity? Well,
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.440]   these terms, of course, are all related, and they're all very similar. Iniquity
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.480]   means unrighteousness. It means an absence of righteousness. It means that
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.760]   which you become when you've ceased to keep the law. While you keep the law,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.160]   you're righteous. If you break it, you become unrighteous. That's a part of
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:15.720]   iniquity. It means wickedness, if you like. It leads to gross injustice. And he says
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:24.080]   that they are literally laden with iniquity. Wicked. There is this terrible
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.040]   absence of righteousness. Indeed, it's the opposite of that. As the
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.120]   righteousness is good and upright, this is twisted and perverted and falls down
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.240]   and so on. Iniquity. Then we come to the word evil, which just means bad or
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:45.000]   wicked or mischievous. It's a terrible analysis, isn't it? Is this just a poet
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   with a lively imagination? No, this is an exact observer. This is a newspaper
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.680]   reporter. This is a man who's mixed with people and who knows life, who isn't
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   sitting in some kind of glass case and is ignorant. He says, "I know life. This is
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   what I've seen." He says, "This is what is true. I see it before my eyes.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.480]   These are the facts concerning it." He puts it right before them, and then he
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.120]   comes to his last term, which is in many ways the most terrible of all. Children
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:18.800]   that are corruptors. Now let's be clear about this. He says these men who are
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   sinful and iniquitous and evil are also corruptors. He means by that that they
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:33.720]   corrupt themselves and that they also corrupt others. Had you realized before
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:40.920]   how up-to-date the first chapter of the book of Isaiah is? I'm almost beginning
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.600]   to think that he was in London yesterday and read all the newspapers and watched
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:53.040]   some of the television programs. Corruptors. What's the meaning of the
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:32:00.120]   word corrupt? I needn't tell you. It means rotten. It means putrid. It means
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.120]   something that's decomposing. It means something that is depraved. It means
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:12.680]   something that is debased. It means something that is perverted. Corruption.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:19.720]   You've seen apples going rotten. They're corrupted. Corrupt apples. Anything that
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.960]   becomes polluted and that festers and that begins to disintegrate and the
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.000]   germs come in and the smell comes out and the whole thing is a putrid mess.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:42.120]   That's corruption. And he says that mankind that has deliberately turned its
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:49.000]   back upon God to make this wonderful life and world for itself has chosen
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.480]   that. That's what it's chosen. Corruption. You know there's a sense in which it's
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:02.120]   almost unnecessary for me to come and visit. The modern world is full of
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.200]   confidence and full of pride. Pride in its achievement. What a wonderful people
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.360]   we are. We mid-20th century people. How ignorant was every generation before us?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.000]   How ignorant were our rude forefathers? Hundred years ago, what did they know? Why,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.680]   what did they know even 50 years ago? What did they know before the war? They
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.180]   hadn't split the atom. Well, they were doing it but not in the way they're
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.300]   doing it now. And so on. Look at the advances. Look at our knowledge. The thing
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.960]   is tremendous. To ask us to believe in God and to believe in righteousness and
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.640]   the Ten Commandments, it's an absolute insult. We are no longer going to be
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.320]   bound by such childishness. Religion's alright in the infancy of the human race
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   but not when a man becomes adult. Not when he stands on his own feet. Not when
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.440]   he uses his mind and reason and understanding. Why, this is for primitives
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:56.960]   not for us. We know something better and we've entered into a promised land. And
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:07.260]   what is your promised land? Corruption. Look at it round and about you. Look at
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.640]   the corruption of life in almost every walk and department. My dear friends,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.840]   isn't it about time that we face the facts? This isn't a theoretical matter.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.400]   Religion is about life and living and about facts. This is the book that's
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.760]   meant to help us to live in this world. And it asks us to face the facts of life.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.280]   You've left God. You've left the Ten Commandments. Very well, you say, you
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.600]   don't need them. You can plan your own life. You can live in your own way. The
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.840]   world is saying that tonight. What's it doing? What's it leading to? What's it
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:42.080]   got to show? I say that it's got nothing to show but this. Sin, iniquity, evil,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:56.000]   corruption, the filth of the newspapers, the filth of the television screens, the
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:05.080]   horrible suggestions, the innuendo, the playing with sex, one of the gifts of God,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:13.000]   the twisting and the perverting of it all, the leering and the giggling and the
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:23.360]   laughter, corruption. Marriage? Laughter. What's marriage? What's a vow? Why should
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.320]   a man be bound by a vow? Why should a man be bound by a pledge? Why should a man be
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.920]   a man of his word? What's it matter? If he suddenly is attracted, why shouldn't he?
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:42.960]   And of course it's all so daring, so wonderful, the look, the glance, the
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   suggestion, the wink. But oh, the corruption and the foulness. Oh, the loss of
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.600]   everything that is clean and pure and chaste and wholesome and ennobling and
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:06.560]   uplifting. The men and women who laugh at you for reading your Bible or for being
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.960]   in a service like this, that's what they've got instead of it. That's what
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.880]   they think is wonderful. That's the thing of which they're bursting. That's the
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.280]   thing which they say a man should rarely go in for, to assert himself and to
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:28.800]   express himself. Corruption. Nothing sacred, nothing pure, nothing noble,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.840]   everything a joke, everything an object of ridicule, everything to be turned off
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:42.380]   and to be laughed at. No sanctities, no feeling, no true emotion any longer, but
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:54.440]   cynicism, suggestion, everything doubted. They are corruptors. But still worse, you
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.600]   see, is this, they not only corrupt themselves, but they corrupt others. And
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.320]   as they do it, they delight in it and burst of it. The Apostle Paul puts this
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.720]   in terrifying language. At the end of the first chapter of the epistle to the
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.600]   Romans, having given that awful account which he gives and which I'm tempted to
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.320]   read to you again, because if you think the Bible is out of date, you're making a
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:25.160]   mistake. The popular programs these days are the programs that are supposed to
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:33.360]   mirror life. That's modern art, isn't it? Modern art is meant to mirror life. We
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.880]   don't like artists any longer that paint beautiful portraits. Ah, we say that's
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.080]   photographic. We don't like that. We don't like plays that did that sort of
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.560]   thing. We want plays now that mirror life. And the programs that are most popular
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.840]   are those that mirror life, that let us see it in the raw as it is. Oh, what tyros
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:00.000]   these fellows are. What mere amateurs they are. What beginners they are. Do you
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.400]   want to know life as it is in London tonight and in this country and in all
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   the countries of the world? Well, I must read it to you. Because that when they
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.440]   knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.600]   their imaginations and their foolish art was darkened. Professing themselves to be
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:24.400]   wise, they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.840]   image made like to corruptible men and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:33.960]   creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.800]   lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves, who
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.720]   changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.960]   than the Creator who is blessed forever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:53.120]   unto vile affections. For even their women they changed the natural use unto
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.320]   that which is against nature. And likewise also the men, leaving the
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.280]   natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one to another. Men with men
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.600]   working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompense
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.400]   of their error which was meat. And even as they did not like to retain God in
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.880]   their knowledge, God gave them over unto a reprobate mind to do those things
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.400]   which are not convenient. And here's the description. Being filled with all
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:30.680]   unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:36.520]   murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.520]   despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:48.320]   without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable,
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.640]   unmerciful, who knowing that the judgment of God, that they which commit such
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:01.280]   things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:07.880]   do them. The cheering of the silly audience, the titter and the laughter.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.920]   They corrupt themselves, yes, but they're not content with it, they want to corrupt
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.360]   everybody else. And they're given the opportunity to do it. And they think it's
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.720]   clever, they think it's wonderful, they have pleasure, and they're applauded, it's
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:27.680]   marvelous, how brilliant, how clever. Oh, how corrupt, how vile, how foul, how
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.040]   unclean. But you see, the principle is the thing that matters, my dear friends, and
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:39.960]   the principle is this, that man, in living a life like that, thinks he's done
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.320]   something very wonderful. He has forsaken God, he has turned his back upon the
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.500]   Holy One of Israel. In order to have that, the son, the prodigal, in his father's
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:59.800]   home was dissatisfied, he left it. There he is, swine, husks, penniless, empty, hopeless.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:06.040]   Have you seen it, my friend? Do you still think it's clever not to believe in God?
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:10.640]   Do you still think it's clever to break the Ten Commandments? Do you still think
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.880]   it's clever to be as unlike Jesus Christ as you possibly can be? Do you think that
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:21.720]   the modern man is really a paragon? God, open your eyes before it's too late.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:29.960]   May the Spirit give you the wisdom to see yourself as you are, you fool, you
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:37.600]   corruptor. Awaken, I say, open your eyes and see where your cleverness has landed
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.240]   you, where your forsaking of God has brought you. But I must hurry to the last
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:48.840]   principle. This is what sin does to men. But you see, the last thing is this. It
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:54.120]   leaves him in utter ignorance of and disregard of the consequences to which
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:42:01.880]   all this inevitably leads. Our sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   seed of evil dwells, children that are corruptors. They have forsaken the Lord,
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:17.000]   they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger. I wouldn't be in this
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.200]   pulpit were it not for this. If I hadn't understood this, I might have been a
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.480]   doctor or a politician or something else, because I think it's the duty of every
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.800]   decent man to do something about the present state of morals in this country.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.960]   But you see, I'm in this pulpit not because I'm interested in morals only.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.240]   There's something still more terrible. Life's bad enough as it is, and as men
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.160]   has reduced it to. But the terrible thing is this. He doesn't know what it's all
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:58.800]   going to lead to. They have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger. Now then,
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.920]   my friends, this is the great message of this book from beginning to end. "And I
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:12.020]   must put it before you as solemnly and as simply and as briefly as I can." Listen
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:17.560]   to Paul putting it in Romans 2, 4, and 5. Here he is saying to men, "Do you despise
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:22.080]   the riches of God's goodness and forbearance and long-suffering, not
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.460]   knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:32.800]   hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:39.080]   wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." What does that mean? Well,
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:53.720]   let me tell you. The one whom man in his wisdom has forsaken is the Lord. He is the
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:44:04.840]   Holy One of Israel. He is our Maker. He is the Judge of the whole world. And he has
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:13.600]   told us from the very beginning that there is to be a day of judgment. He is the
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:20.340]   Holy One of Israel. He hates sin. His wrath is upon sin. God wouldn't be God if he
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:25.200]   didn't hate sin. If God didn't manifest his wrath against sin, he wouldn't be God.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.600]   His light and in him is no darkness at all. And he made man for himself. And he
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.200]   meant to enjoy him. And man has become what I've described to you. And God in
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:44.080]   heaven, he hates it. He abominates it. He's told us so. He's told us so in his
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.440]   messages to people like Moses. He's told it in his messages to the prophets. He's
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.180]   told it still more plainly in the message through his own beloved Son, our
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:00.080]   Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Don't listen to the foolish people who say, "I
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.960]   don't believe in the wrath of God. I believe in the God of Jesus." What I read
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:08.080]   to you out of Luke 17 at the beginning was the words of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:16.600]   And it is he who says, "As they were in the days of Noah, eating and drinking,
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:23.720]   marrying and giving in marriage." Of course. Typical Saturday night. "And as they were
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   in Sodom." Oh, what were they doing? Same thing. Eating, drinking, marrying, giving in
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.280]   marriage, planting, buying, selling. Having a wonderful time. Business was good.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.600]   Pleasure, plenty. Let's have more of it. The joys of Sodom and Gomorrah, the place
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.800]   that Lot chose. Abram was a fool, of course. He lived on top of the mountain.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.600]   Lot had an eye to business. He knew what was what. He wanted some pleasure. He
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.400]   wanted to do well. He chose the cities of the plain. Life of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:59.040]   Here's life. London at its best, with all the wonderful programs. "As they were in
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:08.120]   the days of Lot, as they were in the days of Noah, and knew not until the flood came
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:20.480]   and took them all away." That's our Lord speaking. "Even so shall it be in the day
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:26.720]   of the Son of Man, my friend, as certainly as you and I are in this chapel." And I say
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.920]   again, I wouldn't be in this pulpit if this were not true. Every one of us is
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   going to stand before God in the final judgment. And He has told us already that
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:45.320]   His wrath is upon sin. The day of wrath, it's called, when God will show what He
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.720]   thinks of this kind of thing and the punishment He's going to mete out upon it.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:59.560]   It will be the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God. God is
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:08.920]   still there. And God always will be there. The world can laugh. The world has often
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.200]   laughed at God. The people before the flood laughed at Him. The people of Sodom
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.160]   and Gomorrah laughed at Him. The people in the time of Christ laughed at the preaching
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.880]   of John the Baptist, ridiculed the preaching of the Lord Himself. The world
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.920]   has always done this, but you know the fact that the world has laughed hasn't
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:35.120]   made the slightest difference. What God has said, God has always done. And God is
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:42.280]   still there. And there's going to be an end to this world. And there is going to
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.840]   be a day of judgment, when the righteous judgment of God against sin is going to
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:54.680]   be revealed and made plain and clear. And every man will have to stand there. Now,
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:03.840]   you can say you don't agree very well. You prove that it isn't true. If you like
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.560]   to risk all that merely on your opinion, my friend, I can say no more to you. I'm
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.400]   simply here to tell you what God has told me to tell you, and here it is. You've
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.320]   got to stand there. And the clever men have got to stand there. Every eye shall
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:24.640]   see Him. Don't you forget that a thousand years are with the Lord as one day, and
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.760]   one day as a thousand years. God doesn't belong to time. You say, "If He's going to
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.440]   do it, why hasn't He done it long ago?" I don't know. All I'm telling you is He's
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.200]   going to do it. "Of that day and of that hour knoweth no man, not even the Son, but
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:52.080]   the Father only." And it's coming. And all I want to tell you is this, that if you
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:49:03.400]   have forsaken God and are living that sinful, iniquitous, evil, corrupt life, all I want
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:09.080]   to tell you is this, that what you're really doing is to treasure up unto yourself wrath
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:16.880]   against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God. What a terrible
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.760]   thing. You see, what it means is this. Look at the miser. There he is. He wants to
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:28.240]   treasure up money. He doesn't spend it. He keeps that penny. He keeps that sixpence.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.120]   He keeps that shilling. He's treasuring it up. He's gathering it. He wants a great
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.680]   pile. Do you know what you're doing by living that kind of godless life, that life
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.080]   that forsakes God and puts your own opinion and your own ideas and your own way of life?
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.600]   Do you know what you're doing? You are treasuring up unto yourself wrath against
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:56.560]   the day of wrath. Everything you do is being marked into your account. Everything. You're
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.840]   treasuring it up. Ha! You say, "I don't believe in God." All right, that's put
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:06.280]   down. "I can do this. Nobody will know." God knows it's down. You're treasuring
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.360]   it up. It's all being amassed. It's all being added to, and the leaves are turned,
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.040]   and there's no end to the book, and everything that you and I have ever done or thought or
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:20.160]   imagined, it's all there. All things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:28.320]   we have to do. Or, if you prefer it in another image that's used in the Scriptures, it's
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:38.120]   this. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth unto the flesh
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:46.360]   shall of the flesh reap corruption. He that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:52.440]   reap life everlasting." Now, this is an absolute law. It's the law of sowing and
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.960]   reaping. If you sow wheat, you'll grow wheat. If you sow oats, you'll grow oats. Sow potatoes,
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:06.440]   you'll grow potatoes. Sow to the flesh, and you'll reap corruption. You can't help
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:12.400]   it. You can't sin without paying for it. You'll pay for it partly in this world.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.040]   You'll pay for it much more in the next world. It's being treasured up. It's being
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.280]   accumulated. Your count is kept, and there you'll suddenly see it, and you'll be
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:30.960]   amazed at it. And what is the end of that? Well, God's righteous judgment will be revealed
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:42.000]   against that. And God's judgment of that is eternal punishment. What is this punishment?
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:48.560]   Well, it's what the Bible calls hell. It's a place of torment. It's a place of suffering.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.320]   It's a place of misery. It's a place of unhappiness. It's a place of evil. It's
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:58.600]   a place of spite and malignity. Do you know what it is? I believe it's some sort of
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:07.160]   eternal filthy program. When you've realized at last that the thing is the best, but you're
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.040]   having nothing else, you've got to live on that forever and ever. That foulness, that
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.560]   suggestion, that evil, that debase, desecration of everything that's righteous and like
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:26.160]   God, you'll just be festering in it to all eternity and shut out from the glory and the
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:37.280]   purity and the holiness of the life of God and His holy angels and His saints and people.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:42.240]   My dear friends, there have already been judgments in this world. I've reminded you of some
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.320]   of them. There was a judgment in the Garden of Eden. There was a judgment at the flood.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.200]   There was a judgment at Sodom and Gomorrah. There was a judgment when the children of
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:57.040]   Israel were carried into the captivity of Babylon. There was a judgment in A.D. 70 when
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:03.240]   the nation of Israel was ruined. The very city brought to the rubble, to the dust, and
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:14.720]   the nation cast out amongst the peoples. There have been judgments in this century. I believe
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.120]   the two world wars we've already had are nothing but the judgments of God upon the
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:26.200]   arrogance and the pride of men since the middle of the nineteenth century. We've already
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:34.480]   had judgments. And there's another terrible one threatening us in the form of bombs. But
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:46.120]   these are mere prophecies and adumbrations of the final judgment that is to come.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.760]   My dear friend, what I'm trying to tell you is this, that if you are living the kind
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.600]   of life I've been depicting, you are treasuring up unto yourself wrath against the day of
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.600]   wrath and the manifestation of the righteous judgment of God. You are provoking the Holy
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:10.760]   One of Israel to anger. You are putting God against you. And that is the terrible and
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:20.920]   the horrible thing about sin. You're making an enemy of God, the One who made you, the
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.320]   One who made you for Himself and who wanted to be your Father and who wanted to shower
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.840]   His blessings upon you, as I was telling you last Sunday night. You've turned Him into
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:35.680]   an enemy. You make Him angry with you. And you'll make Him punish you. And His wrath
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:48.400]   will come upon you. Can't you see it? Can't you see it? Look at what you've left. Look
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:53.320]   at what you've got. Look where you are. What is this life of yours? What's in it?
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:55:02.720]   What's it leading to? What's it giving you? What's it going to end in?
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:09.520]   The amazing thing to me is that God still speaks to us, but He does. Though the nation
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:16.040]   of Israel was like that, God sent His prophet Isaiah to speak to them. Why? Well, to deliver
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:22.920]   them out of it. And what's the message? Here it is, I told you at the beginning. Repent.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:28.960]   Recognize what you're doing. See the utter folly of it all, the arrogance, the enormity
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:37.400]   of it all. Repent all. Hasten to God and acknowledge it and confess it. Fall at His feet. Ask Him,
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.760]   "Is it still possible that you can pardon me? Is it still possible that you can receive
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:52.440]   me?" And He'll say to you, "Yes. I loved you even when you didn't know it. I loved
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:59.520]   you even when you were walking away from me. I loved you even when you spurned me and ridiculed
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:06.360]   me and despised me and my name and my laws and my home and all I meant for you. I have
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:13.000]   loved you with an everlasting love. In spite of it all, I sent my Son to die for you, to
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:22.760]   bear your punishment. Believe in Him and I'll receive you back. And I'll take off your filthy
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:29.600]   rags of you and I'll wash you. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:38.300]   as snow. I've got a new robe for you. I'm going to give you the robe of my known Son.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:43.320]   It's a spotless robe of righteousness. I'm going to give you a prominent position in
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:48.080]   the family. We'll have a great feast and the angels of heaven are tuning their harps. They're
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   ready to sing at the return of one such as yourself. Thank God that though we all have
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:06.920]   sunk so low as the result of men's original sin and our own personal sin, that we are
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:16.080]   a sinful nation, that we are laden with iniquity, that we are a seed of evildoers and corruptors
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:27.480]   and corrupt and vile and foul. If we acknowledge it and repent and believe, on the name of
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:37.000]   the only begotten Son of God, crucified for us, body broken, blood shed, the past shall
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:48.600]   be forgotten, a present joy be given, a future grace be promised, a glorious crown. In heaven,
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:54.560]   have you seen it? Well, tell him. Amen.
