[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which we have already read from the Gospel according to St. Luke in chapter 12.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   The message really is to be found in the first 12 verses. Let me just remind you again of the beginning.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   In the meantime, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trod one upon another,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   he began to say to his disciples first of all, "Beware ye of the living of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy;
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not be known.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And I say unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do;
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear. Fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yea, I say unto you, fear him."
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Now, our Lord at this point, as you see, was sending out his disciples to preach and to teach and to cast out devils.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But before he sends them away, he addresses them in these words and in the words that follow.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And obviously he did that because he felt that it was necessary that he should do so.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He was aware of certain dangerous tendencies and possibilities in these men.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So, in order to safeguard them and to protect them and to forewarn them, he addresses them in this way.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He knows that without this help which he is giving them, they will undoubtedly become discouraged.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Indeed, there were even worse and more dangerous possibilities confronting them than that.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He knows that unless they have a clear understanding of the life into which he has called them and the life into which he is now sending them,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   that they may very well become guilty of almost denying him and the terrible consequences that follow that.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So, he gives them this instruction, he gives them this warning, in order that he might prepare them for the future
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and the Christian life which they were now going to live in actual practice in again saying, "End a sinful world."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   In other words, our Lord here gives a kind of prescription to these people.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Here he gives them an outline of the way in which they are to live, what they have to avoid and what they have to remember.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So that we can regard this paragraph, these first twelve verses in this twelfth chapter of Luke's Gospel,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   as a kind of outline given by our Lord himself of the way in which as Christian people we are to live.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Now, what he said to these disciples is as applicable today as it was then.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And it seems to me that we can do nothing better as we start a new year together and as we face the future,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   than to look into this instruction which is here given so plainly and so clearly by our blessed Lord himself.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The Christian life is meant to be a life of happiness, it's meant to be a life of confidence, it is meant to be a life of success.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That is what our Lord is really saying to these men.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   But there are things which are always threatening them.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   There are forces which are always tending to make us unhappy, to shake our confidence, with the result that our life becomes a failure.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And it is in order therefore that we may consider together these dangerous tendencies and see how to avoid them and to evade them and overcome them,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   that I am directing your attention to this.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I wonder how we feel and how we find ourselves as we examine ourselves at this particular moment.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   What has happened to us in the past in our Christian life and living?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   How do we feel at the moment? Are we full of confidence? Have we got assurance?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Or are we troubled? Are we unhappy?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   If we look back, what do we see? Do we see failure or do we see success?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Are we quite happy about ourselves and our witness and our Christian living?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Those are the questions which inevitably must arise in our minds as we consider our Lord's teaching at this particular point.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You see, he is telling these men, "Unless you are very careful, unless you listen to what I am saying to you,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   you will find yourselves perhaps almost denying me and denying the very gospel that you claim to believe.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And that will make you terribly miserable. It will make you unhappy.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It will spoil your influence, spoil your witness, quite apart from the eternal consequences.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You will be unhappy and you will be fearful."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Now that is the atmosphere which he is depicting here. And his concern is, of course, to deliver them from that.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We should not be living a life of fear as Christians, always full of foreboding,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   always wondering what is going to happen to us, and allowing the world in which we live
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   to determine our type and our kind of life and the state of our soul and spirit.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   We are meant, as the Apostle Paul puts it, to be more than conquerors.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We are meant to be men and women who show this element of triumph and of victory and of rejoicing and of assurance.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Well, now then, let us consider what our Lord has got to say about all that.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   This is the way in which we face the future.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   The matter, as I see it, divides itself into two main sections.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   First of all, there are certain hindrances to the Christian life.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   There are two main hindrances, two things which, according to our Lord, above everything else,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   we have got to be very careful about as Christian people.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Now, the two things go together. Obviously, that is why he puts them together.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   They are different, and yet they are related, and the one tends to lead to the other.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But our Lord gives them a separate and a particular treatment, and we must do exactly the same.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   What is the first danger which we always must avoid?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Or, putting it in another way, what is the chiefest enemy to a Christian life of confidence, assurance, happiness, and success?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Well, according to our Lord, it is hypocrisy.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Here he is, you see, sending these men out.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Who would have imagined that he would have said a thing like this to them?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Here they are being sent out upon their great mission, preaching, teaching, casting out devils.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Here he is, he began to say unto his disciples, first of all,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   "Beware of the living of the Pharisees," which is hypocrisy.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   No doubt our Lord had this very much in his mind, because, as we are told in the previous chapter,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   he had a kind of altercation with the Pharisees.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And there they displayed exactly this central weakness, and there he unmasked it and exposed it to them and denounced it.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So now he turns to his followers and he says, "Now, if you really want to be successful in this mission into which I am sending you,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   if you really want to enjoy the life into which I have brought you, at all costs,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   beware of the living of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Now, what is this? What is hypocrisy?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   We all tend to think that we know exactly what hypocrisy is, and yet surely that is half the trouble.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That is why most people who spend a great deal of their time in denouncing hypocrites are themselves the chiefest of hypocrites.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   That's a part of the very condition.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It isn't quite as simple as it appears to be.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   The normal definition given of a hypocrite is a man who is pretending to be something that he is not.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Of course, that comes into it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But that isn't the whole of hypocrisy by any means, and in many ways it is the least part of hypocrisy.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Well, what is hypocrisy? Well, ultimately, hypocrisy is this.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It is a desire to have the best of both worlds.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Now, we have got, of course, the picture of the hypocrite, haven't we?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   A sort of Uriah Heep, a man who is putting on an act, a deliberate conscious act, an imposter, a deceiver.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   But that is not hypocrisy.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   There are very few people who are guilty of that.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   But there are large numbers of hypocrites.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And as our Lord says, it is the most subtle temptation of all,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   the thing against which, therefore, he warns these disciples of his in a very special manner.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   It is, I say, in many ways, just that.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   It is this attitude towards religion, towards Christianity, which desires to have the best of both worlds,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   this world and the next.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It is, as it were, the desire to be Christian and non-Christian at the same time,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   to have a foot in both camps.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Or, if you like, we can define it like this.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It is the attitude and the point of view towards Christianity,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   which believes in doing the minimum that is consistent with safety.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   That is hypocrisy.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So, let's get rid of this notion of this deliberate conscious act.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   No, no, that isn't it at all. This is it.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It is the man who has decided, well, of course, I don't want to go to hell, I want to go to heaven.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But now then, I am just going to do the minimum that is absolutely necessary,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   the minimum that is consistent with safety.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   There it is in its essence, but let's analyze it.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Let's analyze its causes particularly.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And as we analyze its causes, we shall be incidentally taking a closer view of the thing itself.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Fundamentally, of course, hypocrisy is a state of self-deception.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The hypocrite is a man who not only deceives others,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   still more tragic is the fact that he deceives himself.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Our Lord is putting it in terms of the Pharisees,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   and the most outstanding thing about the Pharisee was this,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   not so much that he pretended to be what he wasn't, but that he was very pleased with himself.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Our Lord has put it in the well-known parable in the 18th chapter of this Gospel according to Zintlouk.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   The Pharisee in the temple went right forward and said,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, especially like this publican.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I fast twice in the week. I give a tenth of my goods to the poor."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Now, that's the essence of hypocrisy.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   That's the thing that made the Pharisee the Pharisee.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Self-satisfaction, feeling that everything was all right, he was doing all that was necessary.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Well, really there was nothing to be troubled about.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   He makes no confession of sin. He doesn't ask for forgiveness. Why?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Well, it isn't necessary. It isn't needed.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Look what he's doing. Look what he is.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That's hypocrisy. That's the Pharisee.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And you see, the very essence of this is, of course, self-satisfaction.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Perfectly content with what he is and what he is doing,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   not aware for a moment that there's anything wrong in his position.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And yet, of course, our Lord says that this is a terrible state,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   and so terrible that he has nothing to do with regard to it except to pronounce woes upon it.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Woe unto you, lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And in the 23rd chapter of Matthew's Gospel, you'll find him piling woe upon woe
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   upon the heads of these poor Pharisees.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   So he turns to his followers and he says, "Look here, whatever else you do or may not do,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Don't deceive yourselves. Don't fool yourselves.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Don't imagine that all is well when all is wrong."
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Well, now, what produces this?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   How does it become possible that we can deceive ourselves in this way,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   about ourselves and about our old condition?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Well, it seems to me there are certain elements. Here is the first.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   It is primarily due, of course, to a lack of honesty.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   There's no question about that.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   A man who deceives others or who deceives himself is a man who is lacking in honesty.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He's not honest with himself apart from being honest with other people.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   The seat of the trouble, of course, is in the heart.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The heart, says Jeremiah, is desperately wicked and deceitful.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Who can know it?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In other words, what our Lord was doing in a sense here to these men was to say this,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   "Look after your heart. Take care of your heart.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Be watchful always about that deceitful heart that is in you."
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And the saints of the centuries have re-echoed our Lord's teaching.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   A saint cries out and says, "I dare not trust my sweetest frame,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   his sweetest frame, my deceitful heart."
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Now, the trouble, I say, with the man who is a hypocrite is that there is this essential dishonesty in his heart
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   at the very center of his life.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And that is what leads to the self-deception.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Well, how does it work? Well, I think it works like this.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The hypocrite is a man who does not expose the whole of himself to the truth.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   He doesn't open his heart to the truth.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   He's always shielding or hiding something.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   He comes to a point when he puts on the shutters, covers over,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   instead of allowing the truth to search him, to try him, and to examine him.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Now, the very opposite of hypocrisy, of course, is that cry that comes out of the heart of the psalmist
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   who says, "Try me, search my reins."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   What he means is this. He says, "I can't do it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I know that I can't do it. I think I can sometimes,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   but then I later discover that I haven't been doing it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I've been shielding something. I've been guarding something. I've been fumbling something.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I've said, 'Yes, that's all open,' but then there's something that I particularly like.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I never allow the truth to come onto that. I always brush it aside. I always talk it away."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   That's the trouble with hypocrisy.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   There's a fundamental lack of openness and of honesty in the heart.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It's a state in which a man protects himself against the word and indeed against his own better self.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   He's protecting himself against the truth.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   He says, "I'm interested in truth."
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And then when he comes to the truth, when the truth begins to touch that most sensitive point,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   that thing that he's most fond of, he doesn't allow it to do so.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And from that moment onward, he's a hypocrite.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   He's being deceitful.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   He says, "I'm a believer in the truth. This is how my life is lived, in the light of the truth."
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   But he hasn't allowed the truth to shine into that part of his life.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   There is the deception.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   "And that is the thing against which our Lord therefore warns us above everything else."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   David understood it.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   "Thou," he says, "desirest truth in the inward parts."
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Everything is to be open. Nothing must be kept back.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   "If I," says the psalmist again, "if I conceal iniquity in my heart, or if I hide iniquity in my heart,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   the Lord will not hear me."
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   This is the first step.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   A fundamental lack of honesty in the heart.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Or then we can put it like this, because that in turn leads to this, you see.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Hypocrisy is due to a lack of clear thinking.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   The hypocrite is a man who uses phrases.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   But he doesn't think about the phrases which he's using.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   He can be very glib. He knows all the phrases.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   He's got it from beginning to end. And he uses them. He talks about them.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But you can almost tell by the very way in which he uses the phrases that he's never really thought them out.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   He's never thought them through.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He hasn't really stopped to consider what they mean.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   What do we mean when we say that we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   What's the content of that?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Well, you see, the moment you really analyze that, you find it involves the whole of Christian doctrine and the whole of your life.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   But people say, "Oh, I believe in the Lord. I always believed in God."
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   But what is it, what you mean by believing in God and believing in Christ?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Now, the hypocrite is a man who doesn't think them out.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   He doesn't use the phrases. And he feels that as long as he uses the phrases that all is well.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Wasn't that the whole trouble with the Pharisees?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   They never worked things out.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   They never drew conclusions from their own statements.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   They never saw the implications of what they professed to believe.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And so our Lord instructed them.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   That's what he does in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew's Gospel, chapter 5.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   "You have heard that it has been said by them of old time."
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And of course you believe that.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "Thou shalt not commit murder."
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   But wait a minute, he says, what does that really mean?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Does murder mean only that you literally kill a man in a physical sense?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   He says, "No, that's only one aspect of it.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   There are other things, calling your brother a fool, saying 'racker,' and so on."
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And so he takes up every one of them.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   But you see, the hypocrite never does that.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   The hypocrite says, "I've never committed murder. I'm all right."
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   "I've never committed the act of adultery. I'm all right."
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   "No, you're not," says Christ. "Think, men. Get at the spirit of the thing. Work it out.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   What is the intention of God's commandment?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Think. Draw the conclusions. Work out the implications."
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   The hypocrite never does that.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   He's kept all the commandments.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Nothing wrong with him. He's unlike this publican.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   He knows what the phrase is. He knows how to talk.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   He knows all about it, as it were.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   But the man, I say, is guilty of a fundamental lack of clear thinking.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   He is a man who has never drawn the conclusions of his own profession.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   "Beware of the living of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy," says Christ.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   "There is nothing more dangerous to the soul."
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And then the last point I would make about it is this.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   It's, in a sense, another way of saying what I've just been saying.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It's a lack of thinking, I say. All right, let's put it like this.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   It's a lack of application.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It is a failure to apply the truth to the whole of one's life.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Now, look at it like this.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   There are three main types of hypocrite.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   There is the intellectual hypocrite.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   There is the emotional hypocrite.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And there is the practical hypocrite.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And each one is as much of a hypocrite as the other.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   They never recognize that, of course.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Each one of them denounces the others.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And they never see that in doing that they are betraying their own hypocrisy.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   "What do you mean?" says someone. "Well, I mean this. Here is the intellectual hypocrite."
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   He is the man who is quite content as long as he has an intellectual knowledge and awareness and apprehension of the truth.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   He reads his Bible, reads books on the Bible, studies theology perhaps, well-versed in the doctrines.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   He's got it all. He's got the system. It's complete in his mind.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And he stops at that.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   He's not concerned about his heart at all. He never thinks of that.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   He believes in this almighty God.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   He never takes the trouble to ask himself, "Do I know what it is to be humbled and prostrated in the presence of that God?"
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   He says, "I believe in Christ. Of course I believe that Christ has died for my sins. I believe that."
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Then he never stops and asks himself, "Well, then do I love him?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Do I say love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all, and must have it?"
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Never stops to do that.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Doesn't worry about his behavior, practice. No, no.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   To be Christian means to understand the truth, to have the doctrine in your head, to be all clear about this.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And he stops at that.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   That's to be an intellectual hypocrite.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Then there is this emotional hypocrite.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   And here's this kind of person.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   This person says, "Of course I don't know anything about doctrine."
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And he says it in such a way that you know that he's sneering at people who do know something about doctrine.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   He doesn't want to know about doctrine. "No, no, no, I'm not that sort of man."
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   "Well, what is this man's position?" "Oh, well, this man has had an experience.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   He's had a vision or something.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Or he's had some strange feeling like electricity going through his body.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Or he finds himself weeping at certain times in singing certain hymns or something like that.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Or when he hears an affecting story. As long as he can still cry, well, he feels he's all right, he's still a Christian."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   "But you know, I'm not everything perhaps a man ought to be.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I wouldn't like to say that I read my Bible as I ought.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And I wouldn't like to say that I'm doing all that I should be.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   But you know, I'm still sensitive to the truth."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And he feels that that puts him right.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   He's only interested in his feelings.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   His mind and understanding don't come in.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Practical application in daily living doesn't come in at all.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   He's persuading himself that he's all right with God and that he's a true Christian because of certain emotional reactions.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   That's the emotional hypocrite.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And then there is this third type.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   The man who's a hypocrite in the realm of the will, what I've called the practical hypocrite.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Here is the modern man, you see.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Oh, not interested in theology, doctrine, nonsense.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And these emotionless, these people with their some stuff.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Christianity, what is it?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Well, keeping your word, honoring your bond, being a straight and an upright fellow.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Moral and good and reliable, that's all.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And of course he denounces these people who take part in prayer meetings.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And these people who are always talking about their knowledge.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And these people who seem to be so emotional.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Hypocrites, he says, look at them.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I never make a profession like that, he says.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   But you hear it in the undertone, don't you?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   I never make a great profession, I never claim to be very much.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   But he's saying to me in time, but of course I'm a wonderful man in action and in practice.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Look at the life I'm living.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   He's the typical Pharisee, you see.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I fast twice in the week, I give a tenth of my goods.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Look at the wonderful man I am.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I don't need any forgiveness, I'm so upright.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Now he never imagines that he's a hypocrite.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   But he's very unhappy about these other people who make professions, as he says.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And who stand forward and who do this and that.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   No, no, he's not a hypocrite.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   But every one of them is a hypocrite.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You see, the essence of hypocrisy is just this.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   That we confine the Christian truth and our relationship to God and the Lord Jesus Christ to just one part of our life.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   That is the whole trouble with the Pharisee.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   That is the essence of hypocrisy.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   They were putting limits, they were stopping it at given points.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   As long as it did what they thought it should do, all was well.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   They wouldn't allow it to search them.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   They wouldn't allow it like a mighty searchlight to examine the depths and vitals of their minds and hearts.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And the fundamentals of their being.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   No, no, they protected themselves.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   They put a case around themselves.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   They satisfied themselves and themselves alone.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Isn't that the very thing the Apostle Paul later says about the Pharisees especially?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And indeed the whole nation of the Jews.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   They going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   My dear friends, our Lord warns us above everything else to beware of this.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   What a terrible subtle danger it is.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I make no apology therefore for asking a few plain questions this first Sunday morning of a new year.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   You say you've got the doctrine.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   All right, I believe you.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   You can have it.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   But what about your heart?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Do you really love God?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   With all your heart and mind and soul and strength, do you love the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   You say you believe this and that.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I ask you, the thing you've got to answer is this.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Is your heart moved?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Is your heart warmed?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Does your heart go out to Him?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Are you constrained by His love?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   If you really believe, you must.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Peter puts it like this.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Whom having not seen, you love.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   In whom, though now you see Him not yet believing, you rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Do you?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And what of your daily life?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Is it governed by God and by the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Is it being worked out in practice?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   What's the value of a sterile knowledge if it doesn't affect the heart and the will?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And so the questions come to others, you who claim to have had experiences.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Do you love the truth?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Are you studying it?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Are you trying to get to know it more and more?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Or are you content to be a babe?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Are you exactly the same now as you were twenty or fifty years ago in knowledge and in understanding?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   "Oh, in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord," says the Bible.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   In understanding, be men.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   You have no right to shut out the intellect and the will and say it's only a matter of the heart.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And likewise, you practical men and women, what do you know of this truth?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Is your knowledge increasing?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Is your heart being more and more melted and broken and moved and filled by the love of God?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   The hypocrite is a person who keeps God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the blessed truth
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   mediated by the Holy Spirit in a compartment or a section of his life and shuts them out to the rest.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   That's the essence of hypocrisy.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   That is the first and the chiefest thing against which our Lord warns us.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   The second thing, of course, comes out of it and it is the fear of men.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   "I say unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Yea, I say unto you, fear him."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   What a potent cause of failure is this fear, fear of men, fear of men.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Look here, says our Lord to these people, don't go out in the fear of men.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   If you do, you're doomed, you're done for.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Your witness is paralyzed before you've started, you're crippled before you've begun.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Don't fear men.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   I know there's a danger, there's a tendency.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   How do we fear them?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Well, we tend to fear their opinions, don't we?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   This sophisticated age in which we live, with all the instruction and the clever talk and the books
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   and the brains and the understanding and the wisdom, what they say?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Do you still believe that book called the Bible?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Do you still say that's the Word of God?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Do you still say that's divinely inspired, my dear?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   They say, "You're a hundred years after the time, at least you're in anachronism."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Or, "This is intellectually demoralizing."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   They say, "No man of knowledge, learning, science, any lot."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And we don't like that.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   We are made to feel that we are fools, that we are ignoramuses, that we don't know, we don't understand.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   We don't like this censoriousness of men.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   We don't like this way in which they seem to pity us and to despise us in an intellectual sense.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Afraid of people's opinions, in certain circles.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Afraid, perhaps, that they may discover that you're a Christian, that you're a member of a church
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   and that you take these things rather seriously.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   You try to hide it, you try to be one of them and put on an ap—that's hypocrisy, of course.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And it's hypocrisy that is produced by the fear of men.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   You're pretending to be one of them and you don't belong to them.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   That is as much hypocrisy as the man who pretends to be so much better than he is in a prayer meeting or in a church.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It's hypocrisy in both cases.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Our Lord deals with both here.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Not only are we afraid of their opinions, we are afraid of their actions.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   We are afraid that they may harm us.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Harm our career, harm us in our profession, harm us financially, harm us in a material sense.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Afraid, perhaps, that they may even conspire against us and that eventually we may even be put to death.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   What if these other powers are going to come into this land?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   What if communism comes? Hadn't I better be careful now?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I hear that they keep a record of people's names and the more outspoken a man is, the more likely he is to suffer when they come.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   This is not imagination. These things have been happening, you know, in this present century.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   They happened in Germany, they're happening in Russia, China and in many another country today.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And in a sense it's happening in this country.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Are we governed by these things?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   The fear of men, the fear of what men may do to us in any sense, what he may think.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   His laughter, his derision, his sarcasm.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   The good opinion of other people in the office, in the room, in the profession, in the shop, in the works, the society in which we turn.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   These are the things, says our Lord, which you have to be wary of because all that leads to a tendency to compromise.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   It leads to a tendency to be ashamed of the gospel.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   To be ashamed of Christ and your relationship to him.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It means that you're putting the opinion of these people before the opinion of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You're saving yourself, you're saving your own skin at the expense of the greatest and the most glorious thing in the world.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Well, now, those are the things against which our Lord warned these disciples as he sent them out.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Because, you see, a man who's in that position is a man who's living a life of fear.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   It's a life of uncertainty and it's an absolute failure.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   He's fooling himself. He thinks that he's somehow or another impressing others, but he isn't.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Nobody respects the hypocrite and the hypocrite is always eventually found out.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Nobody likes a man who's trying to be two things at the same time. He's a man to be despised.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   The world doesn't like a man like that, neither does the church.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   He's a failure. He's miserable. He's unhappy.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Because he lacks this fundamental honesty and integrity.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Because he's not true in the center of his life, in his heart.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   He's not upright. He's not straight.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   But there is something that's even worse about him. He's a fool.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And that brings me to the second matter, and I merely give you my headings this morning.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   How are we to overcome these dangerous tendencies?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And our Lord gives the full answer in this one paragraph alone.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   The first thing, of course, is the need of utter, absolute honesty,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and sincerity and truth with ourselves, with the truth, with God and with the Lord Jesus Christ, and with men.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   There is no hope in the Christian life apart from honesty.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   You read the life of any saint that's ever trod this earth,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and you'll find that his greatest characteristic has been his honesty and his integrity.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And then people come and say, "Why can't I get this experience? Why doesn't this happen to me?" and so on.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And the answer is, of course, that you're dishonest.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   We can't have God's blessings on our own terms.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   You can't strike a bargain with God. There is no compromise in the spiritual realm.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Well, what have we got to do? Well, here is our Lord's way of putting it.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   First, realize the truth about men.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "Here you are," he says, "quaking in the fear of men. But wait a moment. Think.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Who are these men? What is the value of their opinions?"
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   "Cease from men whose breath is in his nostrils."
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Read again that 51st chapter of Isaiah, a portion of which we read at the beginning.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   You see, the warning had to be given in those days, even as our Lord had to give it,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   and even as we have to give it now.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Look at the men who you're afraid of, these people whose opinions that you so admire,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and you're afraid that they're going to criticize you.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   These people that make you compromise your loyalty to the truth.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   But look at them. Who are they?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Why should we pay the slightest attention to their opinion?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Look at their ignorance. What do they know?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   These learned people of the brains, trust and others, what do they know about life?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   What do they know about death? What do they know about eternity?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   What do they know about God? Yet let me ask a more practical question.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   What do they know about living? What do they know about morality?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   You see, that is the question. They're ignorant, they're arrogant.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And don't be frightened by their opinions, my dear friend.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You'll find that they change like the weathercock.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   There were many Christians a hundred years ago who began to quake
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   because of Charles Darwin's "Origin of Species."
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   "Ah, this is science. We must be careful. We must modify our Bible.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   We must modify what we say."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   But you know there are large numbers of scientists today
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   who don't believe at all what Charles Darwin taught.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   They say that his theory of natural selection is utterly discredited.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Buy a copy of Dent's latest edition of "The Origin of Species"
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and read the introduction by Professor Thompson,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and you'll find it is a denunciation of Darwin's theory.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Why do you pay such attention to these people?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   They say this today, they'll be saying something else tomorrow.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Truth, they say, is always moving.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Well, why pay any attention to what they say?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   It is ignorant, it is arrogant, it is changeable, and above all, it is sinful.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   But not only that, why don't you realize that finally they have no power to harm you?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   All that they can do is temporary.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   They can perhaps kill the body, but after that they have nothing that they can do.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   They are capable of making us unhappy temporally.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   They are capable, finally, perhaps even of killing the body,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   but thank God they can do no more.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   They can't touch the soul.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   They can't touch the spirit.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   They can't touch that which is vital.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   These people at whom you tremble, my dear friend, they'll be dead quite soon.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   They'll be rotting in a grave.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Why do you pay such attention to them?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Why pay such attention to men whose breath is in his nostrils?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Don't fear men, says our Lord.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Don't let your soul's eternal destiny be influenced by these people.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Who are they? What are they?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   These people that you're so afraid of, and who make you dissimulate,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and hide what you really are.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   What have they got after all?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Examine their knowledge, their minds, their understanding.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Examine their lives, their morality, their home life, their married life.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Who are they?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Pay no longer any attention to them, says Christ.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Learn the truth about men, and then add to that the truth about God.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Yea, I say unto you, fear him.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   What a fool the hypocrite is.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   He congratulates himself that he's shielding that darling sin against the truth of God.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Men alive, God sees that.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   All things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   You are they, said Christ to the Pharisees, that justify yourselves before men,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   but God seeth the heart.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   And that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   What a fool a man is, what fools we all are.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   We think we are clever, but God sees it all, he records it all,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   and we'll all stand before him, and he is the judge eternal.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And he has power not only to kill, but to cast into hell.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Men at the very best can only kill your body, you know,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   and that's an action in time alone, it doesn't touch your eternal destiny.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   But our eternal destiny is in the hands of God.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   He knows all, he sees all, he remembers all, he will judge all,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and it is an eternal judgment.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   What a fool the hypocrite is.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Realize the truth about God and that you're in his hands.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   But don't stop at that, realize the wonderful nature of the Christian life.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Listen to this.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   What are you afraid of?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and not one of them is forgotten before God?
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   What's it matter what men may think of you, or what men may do to you,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   or what the world may do to you,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   while you're in the hands of such a God?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   He's numbered the very hairs of your head.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   My dear friend, we none of us know what is going to happen to us in 1960.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Does it matter?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Does it matter at all?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   The only thing that matters is this, that I am in the hands of God,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and that he has numbered the very hairs of my head,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   that nothing can happen to me apart from God,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   that all things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   I don't want to see the future, I don't want to know it.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   All I want to know is this, that I'm there in God's hands, come what may.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   That's enough. I don't want anything else.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Let men think what they like, let them do what they like.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   This is the thing that matters. This is eternal.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Then think of the intercession of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God."
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   What a wonderful thing, that Christ shall tell them about me.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   What's it matter what men say, while angels are applauding and are interested in me?
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   But you say life may put you in very difficult and trying places.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   It's all right.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   When they bring you unto the synagogues and unto the magistrates and powers,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   take no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   That's it.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Don't be a fool.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Don't be a hypocrite, because you can't fool God.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You can fool yourself, you can fool men, but never God.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   And Christ says, "If you deny me, I'll deny you."
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   But why even have a desire to do so?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Why be influenced at all by men and women who are round and about us,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   whose breath is in their nostrils and who are so limited and passing?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   While God is my Father and loves me, and has numbered the very hairs of my head,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   and Christ is my great High Priest and Intercessor, my Advocate with God,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and while the Holy Spirit is in me, teaching me, enlightening me,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   giving me words to speak and instruction, and leading me ever onwards,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   sanctifying me, because he is preparing me for the great day which is coming,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   when Christ shall come and receive me unto himself,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   and we shall enter into the joy of the Lord,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   into the many mansions which he has been building and preparing for us,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and we shall spend our eternity in the presence of the glory of God.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Open your heart to the truth.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Be honest with God and with yourself,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   and you will have nothing else to fear, nothing at all.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Amen.
