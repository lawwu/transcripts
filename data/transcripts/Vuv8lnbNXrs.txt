[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540]   Pastor John, I know you're headed to the airport and for Dallas for a short trip to meet with
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.500]   some of our partners in Texas.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.660]   But before you head off, we have a question for you on Romans 9.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.540]   In fact, we have 150 emails now about Romans chapter 9, by far the most asked about chapter
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.580]   in the Bible in our inbox.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.380]   Here's one of them, a recent email from a listener named Aaron.
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.900]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.480]   I was reading Romans 9 today and came across what is known to be a very hard to swallow
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.100]   passage and doctrine.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.260]   While I believe God is sovereign, I can't help but take into account Paul's 'what if'
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.460]   statement at the beginning of verse 22.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.680]   Is the language here being used as we would use it today, almost implying that God can't,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.660]   but doesn't necessarily mean He does it?
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.920]   Is that a feasible interpretation?
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.880]   How do you explain this conjunction and its implications on our interpretations of Romans
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   9.22?"
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.260]   Well, perhaps just to encourage those who struggle with the message of Romans 9, let
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.140]   me give a little biography, autobiography, I mean.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.220]   When I was teaching Bible and Greek at Bethel College, 1974 to 1980, virtually every class
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.940]   brought up the problems of the sovereignty of God vis-a-vis the will of man.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:34.300]   If God is as sovereign piper as you say, how can man be accountable for his sin?
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.340]   And eventually in these discussions, I would go to Romans 9 as part of my answer.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.020]   And there would be great disputes over how to handle Romans 9, especially 1 to 23.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.580]   So in spring of 1979, I asked for a sabbatical.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.140]   I had been there about six years, it was time.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:08.340]   And from May of '79 through January of '80, as I studied, all I did was think and pray
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.340]   over Romans 9, day and night, every day.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.200]   And I had to settle for myself.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.580]   This is the point of what I'm saying.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.500]   This was a great struggle for me.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.940]   I feel like Romans 9 is a watershed of how you view God.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.580]   I had to settle for myself whether this chapter meant what it seemed to mean, what I was saying
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.140]   it meant, or did it have some other explanation.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.060]   And out of that nine months or so came the book, The Justification of God, an exegetical
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.300]   and theological study of Romans 9, 1 to 23.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.860]   So I have shared the struggle with those who read this chapter and scratch their heads
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.260]   and try to reorient their minds.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.460]   I have shared that.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.140]   I don't think Romans 9 is up for grabs, though.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.100]   I think Romans 9 really addresses the eternal destinies of people, not just historical roles.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.680]   And it does deal with individuals, not just corporate peoples.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.460]   Those are usually the two reasons people give for saying, "No, you shouldn't use Romans
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.620]   9 to talk about individual election or predestination."
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.940]   This is not hard to see.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.820]   Let me show our listeners from Romans 9, 2, and 3 how I approach the chapter, and I think
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.820]   they'll see it.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:42.300]   It says, Paul says, "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.380]   For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.500]   brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh."
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.660]   So what's he saying?
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:05.660]   He's saying that individual Jews, kinsmen of Paul, are lost and perishing.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:14.060]   And this creates for Paul not only a heart-wrenching personal agony, which he describes, but a
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.660]   massive theological problem.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.780]   Have the promises of God failed Israel?
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.540]   I mean, if Jews—and he's not talking one or two, he's talking most of them—have
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.380]   a veil over their face, and they're not seeing Jesus as their Messiah.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.740]   So the question addressed in this chapter is, has God's promise to Israel fallen?
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.340]   And the presenting issue is precisely that some Jews—not the people as a whole—some
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.780]   Jews have fallen.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.380]   They're perishing.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.820]   And Paul's answer in verse 6 is, "It is not as though the word of God has failed."
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.060]   And then he gives his basic answer.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060]   Why?
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.700]   Because not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.620]   That's his basic answer.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:20.580]   In other words, Paul answers the problem precisely by pointing out that individual lost Israelites
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.420]   are not really part of the Israel who inherit the promises.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.100]   It's the lostness of individuals that creates the problem.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.840]   It's not imposed on this chapter.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.780]   It's the problem.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.240]   Within Israel, there are Israelites who are perishing, and Paul solves the problem theologically
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.380]   by saying God's word to Israel has not fallen because not all Israel is Israel.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.340]   And the rest of Romans 9, 1 to 23 is Paul's demonstration, vindication of the justice
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:01.300]   of God in the exercise of his sovereignty in having mercy on whom he will.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.460]   So verse 14, what should we say?
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.220]   Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.060]   That's where I started in my writing my book.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.660]   Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.420]   And his answer is, "By no means."
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:23.540]   And the rest of it, verses 15 to 23, is a support for why there's no injustice on God's
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.540]   part.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.500]   He gives his argument for—verse 15—he says to Moses, "I'll have mercy on whom
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.340]   I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.260]   So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who has mercy.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:47.100]   So God is free—free—mercy on whom he'll have mercy, free to show mercy and grace to
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.140]   whomever he wills.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.540]   Nobody deserves it, and God is not unjust to give it freely to whomever he will and
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.900]   not to another.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.860]   Now why does God exercise his freedom in choosing one and not another?
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:10.900]   And that brings us to the question that Aaron in this—the question you asked me—posed
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:19.260]   in verses 22 and 23, because this is Paul's most ultimate answer in the Bible, I think.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.860]   Everybody should put their ears up when I say that.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.180]   Whoa, that's a big claim.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.180]   Check that out, Piper.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.500]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:36.380]   Verses 22 and 23 are Paul's most—I would say the Bible's most—ultimate answer for
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.860]   why God does what he does in choosing one and not another.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.460]   And here's what it says, and this is the very sentence that Aaron asked about.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:53.820]   What if—now in the Greek it's just "if," but "what if" is okay because it should
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:00.020]   be answered, "What if," namely, well, no legitimate objection can be raised.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.420]   I'll come back to that.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:08.820]   What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.420]   much patience the vessels prepared for destruction?
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:19.980]   In order that, he might make known to the vessels of mercy the riches of his glory,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.660]   the vessels which he prepared beforehand for glory.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.820]   And Aaron is asking, do the words "what if" at the beginning of verse 22 suggest
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.260]   that God could act this way but doesn't act this way?
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.460]   That's what he's asking.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.860]   Does "what if" mean, oh, yeah, he could act that way, and that would fit with Piper's
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.180]   Reformed understanding of this text, but he doesn't really act that way.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.540]   Is that a feasible interpretation?
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.260]   And the answer is no, that's not a feasible interpretation.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.300]   It's not feasible to take the words that way.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.420]   And there's several reasons, but let me just zero in on one.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:04.180]   The reason is that this "if" that introduces verse 22 and 23 has really already happened
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.180]   in Romans 9.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.460]   It's not a question of whether it's going to happen.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:15.060]   It did happen, and Paul is restating what he has already said, drawing out the implication,
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.420]   namely with regard to Pharaoh.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.380]   And Paul says, what if God, desiring to show his wrath and make known his power, desiring
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.980]   that, that's what he desired, has endured with much patience, vessels of wrath prepared
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   for destruction?
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:37.780]   Well, he's restating the very thing that he just said he did in regard to Pharaoh in verses
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.780]   17 and 18.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.440]   Here's what that says.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.500]   For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:56.060]   might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.940]   So then he has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens whom he wills."
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:09.660]   So when Paul refers four verses later in verse 22 to God's "desiring to show his wrath
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:15.460]   and make known his power, has endured with much patience, vessels of wrath prepared for
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.060]   destruction," that's exactly what he has just done with Pharaoh in verse 17.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.140]   This "what if" is not hypothetical.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.140]   It's actual.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.380]   He did it.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.560]   And the "what if" is, what if he did it?
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.580]   Can any legitimate objection be raised?
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.900]   And his answer is no.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.940]   So Paul's overall point in this section is this.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.640]   God is just in having mercy on whom he will, verse 14.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:53.060]   He does no one, no human being, ever, anywhere, he does no one any wrong.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.460]   And he always upholds the infinite value of what is infinitely valuable.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.260]   That's his righteousness.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.820]   Namely, he upholds his glory.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:11.140]   And in his absolute glorious freedom, "I'll have mercy on whom I have mercy.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.420]   I'll be gracious to whom I'll be gracious."
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.680]   His absolute glorious freedom, he makes known the riches of his glory for the vessels of
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.480]   mercy, that's verse 23.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.700]   That's the ultimate goal of the universe.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:32.440]   And those vessels of mercy are prepared beforehand by God for glory.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.900]   But in this moment, in this very moment, the vessels of mercy—I'm talking now to our
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:50.020]   listeners—in this very moment, the vessels of mercy are everyone and anyone who calls
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.460]   on the name of the Lord.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.460]   Amen.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.460]   That's really good.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.900]   The watershed chapter for how we understand God and his works.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.580]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.620]   Serious students of the New Testament who want to go deep into Romans 9 and who can
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.460]   navigate a little Greek and Hebrew along the way should check out that book, The Justification
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.280]   of God, an Exegetical and Theological Study of Romans 9, 1-23.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.340]   It was published by Baker Academic in 1993, and you can also find it in the 13-volume
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.700]   Collected Works of John Piper.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.540]   See volume 1, pages 285-531.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.100]   Pastor John is off to Dallas for a brief trip, and then we return on Monday.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.860]   I'll ask John Piper, "Why did God alienate disabled persons in the Old Testament?
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.940]   It seems harsh."
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   That's a great question.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.940]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.820]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.320]   [END]
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   1. What is the definition of a disabled person? A disabled person is a person who is disabled.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.380]   you
