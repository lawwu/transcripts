[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   How mad is Sax going to get when he sees my button situation today?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.400]   I'm going to join you.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.160]   Chamath, how are you doing?
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.360]   Oh my God.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.500]   Look at the collar situation.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.780]   Look at the button situation.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.920]   Look at that.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.600]   Oh, this is fantastic.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.420]   Oh, hey, besties.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.700]   Just got off the lake.
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.160]   Where?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.700]   The lake?
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.880]   I just got off the lake, yeah.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.320]   I was just on the lake with the boat.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.960]   Lake Cuomo?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.920]   Where were you?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.660]   I was doing a little wakeboarding in Tahoe.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.520]   Yeah, I was still wakeboarding.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.140]   Me and Sax.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.940]   Me and Nat took all five kids and we navigated the entire island of Sardinia.
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.900]   For eight days.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.600]   Amazing.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.280]   And by when you say we navigated, you mean the crew navigated and you ate seafood.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.480]   Yeah, it took a village.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:56.700]   All right, everybody.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.380]   Welcome to episode 91.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.920]   Episode 91 of the All-Star.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.440]   in podcasts. Yeah, we're still here. Uh lots of news to discuss this week with me of course
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.060]   to chop it up from his deposition room, uh the war room, the Rain Man himself, David
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.780]   Sacks. How are you doing brother? Good. Big week for you. They're all big weeks. They're
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.240]   all big weeks. Yeah, you look tired. Well we're recording pretty early today. It's a
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.940]   little exhausting. You actually look really tired. What are you talking about? I just
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.640]   got off the lake. I feel fresh. I was just wakeboarding this morning. I'm like Tahoe.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.600]   Oh, okay. Refreshed. I'm refreshed. Uh and of course in front of his uh nine dollar clip
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.520]   art uh that he blew up on easyprince.org, the Sultan of Science himself, David Friedberg.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.760]   How are you sir? Always great to be with you J Cal. Are you working? It boosts my self-esteem
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.320]   and my morale to be with you every morning that we get to connect over Zoom. Well I'm
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.240]   glad that your performance has been stratospheric the last three weeks. You're going on a hot
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.540]   streak. Let's see if you can continue it on episode ninety-one and missing many buttons
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.540]   this week. Uh.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.540]   Uh.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.700]   We've got at least a three or four button August going. How are you doing uh dictator
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.520]   uh from your island, the remote island? Did you uh you you invaded an island? Markets
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   go up another five percent and one more button comes undone. Oh I love it. So this is twenty
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.500]   percent up and we could go to twenty-five. That's a bull shirt. Daddy's back. The more
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.040]   bullish he gets on the market, the more he unbuttons. Daddy's back. So the buttons. Are
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.300]   the low rise jeans on right now or are you wearing shorts? What are you wearing? Show
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.440]   us those stick legs. I'm wearing these beautiful linen
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.560]   shorts. Can you stand up and show us? Yeah, come on. Give us a three sixty. Come on. Let's
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.660]   see. Let's go down. But these are the most beautiful. Oh inner thigh. That's a little
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.880]   too much thigh. Yeah. That's like a chicken wing. You guys like this? It looks tight too.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.620]   Very tight. Are you? Yeah, those are definitely yours. Are you wearing like a children's size
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.340]   or something? Is that a junior size? I like, you know, I like the tighter sizes. You do?
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.620]   I do like the tighter sizes. I think they uh they they fit my body tight. Accentuate all
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.340]   the little bumps. Yeah. I like the tighter sizes. I think they uh they they fit my body
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.940]   tight. Accentuate all the little bumps and nodules. Too much information. Alright, let's
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.660]   start with um there's a lot to talk about this week. I think one of the most interesting
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.000]   things last week we're talking about it in the group chat uh that doesn't exist. Uh Vision
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.340]   Fund's $21 billion investment loss for the quarter. Masayoshi-san did a really great
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.100]   uh YouTube video. I sent it around. Did he get any of you guys watch the video? Yes.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.980]   No. Oh okay. It's it's really interesting to watch. We'll put it in the show notes.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.240]   It's like a six minute interview he put on his
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.920]   earnings page, right? Like right when they put out quarterly earnings, he's like, here's
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.360]   my interview. Yeah, they he you know, he comes to a podium and basically talks about uh the
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.220]   Vision Fund. Obviously, if people don't know, the Vision Fund one was $100 billion, largest
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.940]   venture fund ever raised um and SoftBank's current market cap is 66 billion. Here's the
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.920]   quote from the FT article sunset on Monday that SoftBank would now subject itself to
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.860]   dramatic cost cutting exercise uh after a $59 billion investment gain at the two Vision
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.700]   Funds almost completely reversed over the past six months. They were up almost $60 billion
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.780]   at the peak and it came crashing down. Masa kicked off the presentation showing portraits
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.820]   of Tokugawa Tokugawa Gawa uh Yasu. This is the uh founding shogun of Japan's uh Tokugawa
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.940]   Shogunate and uh he ruled Japan for six. I mean, I'm killing this. It's such a long intro.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.620]   God, it's so hard. Yeah, I mean, but it was just so great. Let me just play a clip for
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.340]   you. Here. Here's a 68 second clip and we'll we'll talk about it right after and then we'll
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.940]   get into what all this means. This is um portrait of Tokugawa Yasu. He actually made a big loss
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.680]   against Takeda Shingen and came back in the background of that Tokugawa Yasu had to face
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.860]   Takeda Shingen which is much much larger army than theirs and uh most of the allies actually
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.620]   said uh this is gonna be the losing battle so that they should not go for it but that's
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.940]   actually better to stay at the castle however Tokugawa Yasu didn't want to lose his face
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.520]   so that he get out from the castle had a battle made a complete loss and suffer and came back
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.140]   and that actually learn lesson he tried to remember and remind his own learnings and
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.800]   put it into this drawing so since the foundation of SoftBank Group I made a two consecutive
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.620]   quarters loss so previous quarter and this time quarter. I made a two consecutive quarters
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.620]   loss so previous quarter and this time quarter. I made a two consecutive quarters loss so
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.620]   previous quarter and this time quarter. I made a two consecutive quarters loss so previous
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620]   quarter and this time quarter. I made a two consecutive quarters loss so previous quarter
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.380]   quarter consecutively, we made 3 trillion yen lever of the loss. So in total, 6 trillion yen loss
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.820]   was made in the past six months. So I believe I need to remind that myself.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.820]   Pretty spectacular loss. And then he goes on to take some Q&A. And this is the, I guess,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.540]   the killer quote. When we were turning out big profits, I became somewhat delirious. And looking
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.560]   back at myself, I am quite embarrassed and remorseful. You remember, of course, and he
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.840]   complained a little bit in this whole thing about how there was a giant bubble without ever
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.580]   recognizing that he kind of created the bubble with a $4 billion check to WeWork at a $47 billion
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.140]   valuation after a 20 minute meeting with Adam Newman. This chart is pretty incredible. This is
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.600]   the net income quarterly. Essentially, you can think of SoftBank as like a holding company of
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.460]   a bunch of different assets, including Alibaba, previously Uber.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.460]   And all of this Vision Fund stuff, 97% decrease in terms of deployment of capital. So if you look at
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.540]   capital deployment as well, nobody ever put this much money to work, especially in privates.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:37.660]   The second chart, if you look in Q1 of 2021, they put 20 billion into work. And then Q1 this year,
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.820]   they're putting 600 million to work. Just quick reflections on this, what we saw here with
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.380]   Masayoshi is on deploying $100 billion at the top of the market into and
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.500]   maybe basically creating the market top. Chamath, are there lessons here or takeaways for you?
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.180]   I mean, I think that people don't seem to understand that
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.260]   if you're going to attempt to be great, there are going to be moments where
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.620]   you look the exact opposite of great. You know, the guy that takes the final shot is the same
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:17.100]   guy that can miss the final shot. And here is a guy over his, you know, 50 year career has had
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.300]   some huge ups and downs. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.460]   great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.540]   going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.980]   This is also the same guy that found a way to rip in 25 or $30 million and made 125 billion off of
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.060]   Alibaba. That's the same kind of person who has that kind of risk tolerance. He was for seven
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.780]   minutes or something, the richest person in the world, and then lost 99% of his wealth in the
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.140]   dotcom bubble. I have enormous respect for a person like this, because I feel like it takes
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.660]   enormous amounts of courage. I've said this before, most people jibber jabber about investing
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.220]   and all of this stuff. But I think that's the same kind of person who has that kind of risk tolerance.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.380]   And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.460]   to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And he's going to be great. And
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.580]   when push comes to shove, they crumble like little bitches and run into mommy's coattails.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:59.740]   It's hard to put lots of money to work. And this is a guy that's done it. So the same person that
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:07.420]   can make 125 billion turns out is the same person that can lose 30 billion. And so one thing is,
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.820]   I would just keep in mind that this is a resilient guy who seems to land on his feet.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.500]   And the second thing that nobody talks about is how smart Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi were
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.580]   in how they structured the investment into the vision fund because half more than half
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.820]   their investment is in preferred equity, which is effectively debt that pays a coupon.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.300]   And you see it now where SoftBank, by the way, who has been pretty smart in how they've managed
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.860]   their Alibaba position, have been using these derivatives and forward swaps to be able to
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.740]   sell and manage their liquidity. So it turns out that, you know, even if the vision fund
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:48.060]   breaks even Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi will have made money, because I think they can't pay to
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:54.860]   6% coupon on, you know, $50 billion is a lot of money over six, seven, eight, nine years. It's a
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:02.060]   lot. SoftBank has found a way to sell down 25% of Alibaba, which is no trivial feat for half a
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:08.220]   trillion dollar company. And this guy gets to keep swinging. And if he you know, hits it one more
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.620]   time, he'll end up with half a trillion. This chart is pretty great. Sax, if you look at this,
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.940]   this is the gain and loss on investments at the vision fund. You can see the first vision fund
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.980]   racing up. Sax, you're the first one to do that. You're the first one to do that. You're the first
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.020]   one to do that. You're the first one to do that. You're the first one to do that. Then coming down,
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:27.100]   I think after that summer of IPOs that we had in the Airbnb, Uber days, and then a huge peak run
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.020]   up in 2021. And then come in crashing down. Apparently he wasn't selling any portion of this
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.500]   that to me was a big lesson of like, maybe pairing some of these winners if it sold 10 or 20% on the
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.460]   way up. This could look like a completely different outcome. But I agree with each
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.900]   month he swung for the fences and there was downside protection built in for the LPS into
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.060]   some of these sacks. What are your thoughts? Any lessons here in terms of the impact on our overall
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.260]   ecosystem or that you can take as a capital allocator yourself?
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.900]   Well, Jason, I think Masa did something you could never do, which is admit a mistake.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.420]   Oh, here we go. Wow. Personal quick.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   Well, when I have my first mistake, I'm certainly willing to admit it. I'm waiting.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.060]   Imagine that you ran 100 billion for sovereigns instead of 100,000 for doctors and dentists.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.020]   You can kind of put yourself in Masa's position.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.900]   Oh, I love sacks in the morning. Sacks in the morning is like a hot cup of coffee.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.980]   Don't wake sacks up early, man. That's a big lesson here. You make sacks go to a 9:00 AM,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.940]   he's coming in early. It's like a bear has been hibernating and you poke him.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.540]   Wow.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.300]   You know, look, I think that SoftBank obviously made some decisions that were,
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.580]   you know, they were sort of peak decisions. They were a little bit bubbly. They didn't take
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.740]   chips off the table when they probably should have. It's easy to fall into these bubbles because,
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.460]   you know, the psychology of it is so powerful. And as, you know, Bill Gurley's pointed out,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:58.780]   these bull markets are more like a sawtooth, which is they gradually go up for 9, 10, 11, 12 years.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.780]   And then when they end, they just, you know, it's like an elevator going down. So,
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.620]   you know, if the market had continued for another couple of years, Masa probably would
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.500]   have made a lot of money. But in any event, look, he took responsibility for the losses.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.660]   This was a very, you know, sort of culturally Japanese speech. I mean,
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.660]   he didn't commit seppuku at the end, but it was kind of the-
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.540]   He was heading that direction. They might have had to move the camera off.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.100]   Oh my God, what is he doing with that sword?
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.060]   It was the verbal equivalent, basically. And look, he took responsibility. What else can you do?
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:38.780]   Now, one thing I would quibble about is the idea that SoftBank caused this bubble. You know,
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.180]   it wasn't just SoftBank. We had tons of new money.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.620]   Tiger comes to mind. Yeah.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.580]   Tiger had huge funds. They were deploying very quickly, but there was a lot of so-called tours
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.540]   money, basically money from crossover funds. Investors who are not primarily VCs came into
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:58.140]   the ecosystem over the last few years, and a lot of that was driven by sovereigns and by liquidity.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:04.300]   So, you know, you can't forget that we had $10 trillion of liquidity pumped into the system over
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.180]   the last couple of years, and many billions of that found its way into the tech ecosystem.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.820]   And fundamentally, you know, VC is not that scalable. There was an attempt
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.500]   to make it scalable. There was an attempt to push more money
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.220]   into VC based on- Why isn't it scalable?
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.500]   Why isn't it scalable? Because people have tried, right? This is not the first time.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.300]   It's a craft business. I mean, that's why we- What does it mean?
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.620]   It is scalable. It's just that if you try to scale it, your returns will go to zero.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.140]   Explain what that means. Yeah.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.660]   Well, it's kind of the same thing, right? Like, I want to just critique the strategy
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.220]   for a second because, you know, we're talking about as if market conditions caused these
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:46.940]   massive write downs, and that is the only reason that these funds have suffered. But, you know, if
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.420]   you read-
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.860]   A lot of the stories of Masa's investments in a number of these companies, and the full list
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.860]   is available and how much he invested. There are many, many stories, and I've heard many of them
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.660]   personally from CEOs that have met with Masa and raised money from him. You go into Masa,
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.340]   you tell some- The bigger the story you tell, the more excited he gets, the more of the world you
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.980]   can capture. And you go in and you're raising $100 million, he's like, "I'll invest $400 million."
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:16.540]   You say you're raising $25 million, he's like, "I want to give you $150 million." And his motivation
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.340]   was always-
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.220]   "I want to give you more capital so you can go capture the market."
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:26.380]   And the problem in that model is that by giving you so much money, capital becomes your primary
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:32.140]   asset as a business. And capital needs to be the fuel that enables your assets as a business
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.180]   to accelerate. But as soon as capital itself becomes your primary asset, the business is
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:42.300]   doomed to fail. And that's a really key point. If you- Let's say- And let me be very specific
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.620]   about what I mean. Let's say you have a direct-to-consumer business that requires online
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.260]   marketing.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.460]   And your business grows well, you spend $100 to acquire a customer. Suddenly someone says,
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.140]   "Here's a billion dollars to spend on acquiring customers." As soon as you have to start deploying
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.620]   a billion dollars, your cost of acquisition goes up, the number of customers per dollar spent goes
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.940]   down, and the business itself starts to look upside down and fail. And that's what happened
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.940]   with a number of these businesses that Masa put in, and he put oversized checks in.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.220]   WeWork is a really well-documented example in terms of what happened.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.540]   When they started to accelerate their growth beyond the natural course of the business because
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.180]   of the amount of capital.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   That they took, it really started to hurt the fundamental profitability and unit economics
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:28.140]   of the core assets of the business. And this strategy theoretically can work to a degree,
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.220]   but Masa took it to a level that had not been seen before. I think I highlighted for you guys,
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.900]   like back in 2011, I think when Andreessen Horowitz, they pitched me on this idea. I was
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.300]   trying to raise $25 million in my company. Mark was like, "We'll give you $40 million. You can
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.500]   accelerate your growth." And he's like, "We want you to go capture the market." And Peter Thiel
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.100]   always used these terms, "Go capture the market."
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.580]   And blitzscaling, Reid Hoffman.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.500]   And blitzscaling, yeah. Reid Hoffman with blitzscaling. And the motivation is,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.660]   "Look, we'll give you more money because the core asset of the business works,
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.260]   the core assets of the business work. So the money should be more fuel for the fire."
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.700]   The problem is if you overindulge, if you put too much money in and the asset cannot handle that
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.740]   much capital, the whole thing collapses. And there's so many documented examples of this in his
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.540]   portfolio. And I think that the strategy is worth highlighting that there are some issues with that
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.020]   strategy.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.660]   There's a lot of technology across all these business categories. It doesn't always work.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:19.900]   Right.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.300]   The core issue here, I think, is, and then I'll go to you, Saxon, then Jamath. The core issue here
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.820]   that you're describing is exactly correct. And it really is up to the founder to decide what they're
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.820]   going to do with that capital. The WeWork example is so instructive because they were buying
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:38.860]   undermarket buildings in the Tenderloin and then marking them up to Class A office space and getting
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:44.060]   those prices. Once they got the masa money, he started buying Class A and offering it at Class B
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.900]   prices and flipped the whole business upside down.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.140]   Right.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.940]   The rate at which you can deploy
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:52.060]   capital does not flex. Right. And so in all businesses, understanding the rate at which you
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:57.100]   can deploy capital to grow is critical to understand how much capital you can raise.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.420]   And then if you raise too much money and you flex beyond what the natural condition of the
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.980]   business is in terms of capital deployment, the economics fall apart and the business itself looks
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.220]   terrible. And eventually you will have a write down.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.820]   And the distraction on the founder is the key. I mean, look at what Adam Neumann,
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.060]   he was easily distracted. He started buying surf machines and companies and starting kindergarten.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.860]   Because you can now.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.660]   Naturally deploy that much capital. So you find unnatural ways to deploy.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.100]   Let me build on that point. I think there was a belief on the part of SoftBank that they did
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.900]   publicly espouse, which is that they could be the kingmaker.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.700]   Totally.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.100]   And in fact, you know, we had some startups that were in competitive markets and SoftBank would
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.380]   basically announce that we're going to be anointing, we're going to be picking a winner,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.780]   anointing a winner and writing them a huge check. And everyone kind of had to play along because if
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.100]   your competitor got that $100 or $500 million check, then you would be presumably way behind.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.780]   So there was this belief that they were going to be anointed. So there was this belief that they
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.340]   could be a kingmaker and make the difference. And I think that what we saw is that for whatever
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.660]   reason, partly because of the dynamics that Freiburg's talking about, that that strategy
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:01.340]   just didn't really work that well. And what it really goes down to is that VCs can be helpful,
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.860]   but they don't ultimately cause the winning companies to be the winner.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.100]   So this idea that you could be a kingmaker, I think was a little bit flawed.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.700]   And I think one way that Tiger actually improved on this model was that they never tried to
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.860]   be a kingmaker. They actually went the other direction, which is, we're going to own less
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:26.300]   of your company. They tried to be passive, non-dilutive capital. And they would do high
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:32.300]   price rounds with reasonably sized checks. But they didn't try to go for 25%, 30% ownership
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.660]   at a late stage. And founders did like that model better. Now, as it turned out, they both had the
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:45.820]   market timing wrong. But I think this kingmaker aspect was a problem. One other aspect of that is
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.460]   that they were not really a kingmaker. And I don't want to beat up on SoftBank too much. I'll
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.940]   say something nice about them in a second. But I think one of the mistakes they made is you'd
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.900]   see them writing multi hundred million dollar checks into companies that were at a very,
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.100]   very early stage.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.380]   Pre-product market fit.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.820]   Pre-product market. Companies, frankly, that we thought were like seed investments.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.940]   Brandless was the perfect example. It was a company that made soaps and dishwashers and cereal,
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.180]   but they had no brand on it. It was like Uniqlo of this. And they gave them, I think,
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.820]   $200 million. And I was like, this is a seed stage company. It makes no sense.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.540]   Right. Right.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:21.340]   Right. I mean, look, they wrote like $500 million seed checks into robotics companies effectively.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:28.140]   And it's because the SoftBank had a thesis. And I think sometimes, again, this goes back to
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.900]   kingmaker, if you're a VC and you think you're the one with the thesis and you're the one who's going
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.340]   to make the difference, it's actually a seductive fallacy to fall into. It's the founder who has the
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:45.100]   thesis. And you can only do so much to help and you can't really force it. And so I think they
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.460]   ended up making some kind of a big mistake.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.220]   And they ended up cutting some really big checks into some companies that were really risky.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:57.420]   And the way that we do growth investing is that it's milestone-based. The size of the
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.420]   check is proportional to the amount of proof that the company has.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.980]   Right.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.580]   And look, the nice thing I'll say about SoftBank is recently, we've actually done some SaaS deals
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.820]   with them that I think are some really good deals. And they've written checks that I think are
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.980]   appropriate to the size of the company and the amount of proof they have. And they've been really
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.380]   easy to work with. And I look forward to doing more deals with them.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.180]   But I think it would behoove them to do more deals like that, where again,
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.620]   check size is related to proof.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:29.260]   I think that SoftBank, in hindsight, made one critical, critical error and only one.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.460]   And everything else was sort of a fait accompli with that one error,
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.700]   which is that in their fund documents, they made this a 10-year fund.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:46.300]   Now, let me explain why is that an error. That is the status quo for all these funds. And
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.940]   the more nuanced part of that decision to make it a 10-year fund is that your investment period
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.340]   is only five years. So you're only allowed to put the money in for the first five.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.140]   And then you have to basically manage the portfolio because there's an expectation that you
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.980]   raise a new fund. So if all of a sudden you have $100 billion in a five-year investing life, the
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:11.420]   math says, "Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, I need to put 20 billion out per year." And then you try to look
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.220]   for, I don't know, let's say 50 companies a year, while the mean check size now, all of a sudden,
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:24.780]   it balloons to 400 million. That was the error. You see afterwards, the very, very smart private
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:32.380]   equity folks who saw that that was the error fixed it. So Blackstone, Silver Lake, when they came on
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:38.460]   the heels of SoftBank, what they did was they raised funds with a 15 and 20-year life. And what
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.660]   that allows them to do and what it would have allowed Masa to do in this situation was just
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.140]   slow it way, way down. Robert Leonard
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.700]   Pace yourself.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.460]   Adam Draper And do fewer deals with much more capital,
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.340]   and then be patient and say, "I'm going to have a 10-year investing life."
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:58.060]   And I think that that would have saved them. And they would have looked incredible right now
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.300]   because they would be the kingmaker in a moment where there is no money flowing into venture
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.500]   and early-stage tech. So in my opinion, I think it was just that it was such an ambitious feat
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.660]   that when it came time to execute, whoever was really in charge of those details
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.060]   kind of fucked it up. And they should have realized the math didn't work
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.900]   for a five-year fund life. And they should have made it a 10-year investment life,
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.700]   which would have put a 20-year fund life on the thing. And I think they would have been fun.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.700]   Robert Leonard Yeah. I mean, if you look at it as 60 months,
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.260]   maybe you take out August and the holidays, you got basically 50 months to deploy 100 billion.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.460]   It's 2 billion a month. 500 billion a week. I mean, how do you even process that many deals?
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.100]   It's impossible.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.540]   Adam Draper The quality of the diligence
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.100]   by necessity has to go to zero.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.900]   Robert Leonard Yeah. It was a crazy strategy.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.820]   Adam Draper If you can breathe, you get money.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:45.980]   Robert Leonard Yeah. If you can breathe, you get money.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.980]   Adam Draper If you can get a meeting, you get the money.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.420]   Robert Leonard Basically, I mean,
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.940]   and if they had just, I'll say there was one-
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.060]   Adam Draper Sorry, Jason, one last thing.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.460]   Robert Leonard You go ahead.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.620]   Jason Wong No. And it forces you to have a team that is so
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.860]   broad and large and diffuse. That is not this game. This is another thing I would love for us to talk
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.020]   about.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.900]   Adam Draper Correct. Correct.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.340]   Robert Leonard Investing has never, will never,
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.300]   and is not ever a team sport. Okay?
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.020]   Jason Wong Explain.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.900]   Robert Leonard It is like basketball.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.500]   Adam Draper You can be on a team, but you are Steph Curry,
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.540]   or you are not Steph Curry. You are Draymond Green, or you're not Draymond Green. You are LeBron James,
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.940]   or you're not. There are J.R. Smiths on a team. There are Tristan Thompsons on a team.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.580]   Jason Wong E.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.380]   And you come together, and the team can win a championship,
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.300]   but there are these exceptional individuals.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:36.940]   Adam Draper Yes.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.820]   Robert Leonard And the firms that have really done well
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:45.820]   consistently over decades embrace that philosophy. Benchmark, Sequoia, you know,
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.300]   these guys don't try to create this team-oriented, glad-handing approach,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.300]   but they also don't allow the teams to get so diffused that there are 500 people running
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.780]   around ripping money in because you basically then return the beta of the market. And if the
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.340]   market doesn't look good in that vintage, then all of your returns look pretty crappy.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.100]   Jason Wong The lesson for me in all of this is,
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.340]   I think, we talk about riding your winners on the show. That came from, just so people understand,
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.300]   when we said ride your winners, and it's famously in the opening song here, what we were talking
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.740]   about was like, don't sell your winners. Don't sell your winners. Don't sell your winners. Don't sell
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.380]   your entire position, like when Sequoia sold their entire Apple position or other people have done.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.900]   But pairing your position would have changed this whole story. If he had paired 10%,
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.820]   20% of some of these names that were breaking out along the way.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.940]   Ben Chklovski I disagree with that, too.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.500]   Jason Wong I think that's insane.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.860]   Ben Chklovski Oh, why? Go ahead.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.460]   Jason Wong That's the dumbest idea in the world.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.620]   Ben Chklovski I think the opposite. He would have had it up.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.580]   Jason Wong A year ago, Sequoia just put out an entire
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:41.580]   document and a roadmap for becoming an evergreen fund. And I read that document.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.660]   And what I thought to myself is, all of this looks incredible unless the market goes down.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.020]   Jason Wong And then the market went down.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.940]   Ben Chklovski And then the market went way,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.020]   way down. Why? Because their whole thesis is we're going to park and hold money. Well, okay.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.420]   But they also allowed a revolving liquidity mechanism for their LPs.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.140]   Jason Wong Every year.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.820]   Ben Chklovski You're a cancer foundation,
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.580]   and you want to fund cancer research, and you expect Sequoia to give you back money.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:09.180]   You fill out a form, and Sequoia basically fronts you the money. Well, excuse me,
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.540]   but you can see how all of a sudden this can very quickly get out of control,
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.020]   because then where does Sequoia get that money? They'll have to borrow it.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.580]   Jason Wong Or a liquid
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:15.820]   aid. Ben Chklovski
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.300]   Some positions.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.420]   Jason Wong But the whole point is to not liquidate positions. This is what they said.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:19.820]   Ben Chklovski Yeah.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.500]   Jason Wong So my point is, I really think,
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.700]   and David said this before, I think a VC's job is to be a VC. It's hard enough to do that job well.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.220]   And if you think that you're going to cascade across all asset classes and do better than the
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:39.180]   market, it's an extremely high bar that creates tremendous pressure and forces you to bring things
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:45.340]   on like debt and all of these leverage lines, which when markets go up will work in your favor,
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:45.500]   but
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.180]   can very quickly turn against you.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.540]   Ben Chklovski I disagree completely,
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.140]   because when if you look at when you're in a private company, and you're you own some private
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.580]   shares, you know, the revenue, you know, the velocity, you know, the management team, you have
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.700]   more insights than everybody, you got a massive information edge, because it's all based on
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:04.540]   insider information before it's public. And pairing your positions in privates can be amazing,
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.860]   because you have some overvalued company because someone like Masa or Tiger comes along and over
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:14.140]   values it. So for venture funds, I think when you start hitting these 50 100x pairing 10% pairing 20
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.420]   percent along the way, you're going to be able to get a lot of value out of it. And then you're going
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.300]   to be able to get a lot of value out of it. And then you're going to be able to get a lot of value
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.540]   out of it. And then you're going to be able to get a lot of value out of it. And then you're going to
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:16.700]   get a lot of value out of it. And then you're going to get a lot of value out of it. And then you're
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:16.860]   going to get a lot of value out of it. And then you're going to get a lot of value out of it. And
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.780]   these private names, especially, would have been brilliant, you're saying don't distribute and
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.820]   just hold on and use data and give people give your LPS of all liquidity. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:31.980]   I'm saying if you have the opportunity to sell in secondary, you should pair your position in your
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.740]   winners. Two or three times. I'm not saying that this would be a different position.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.460]   No, but like you're using soft, you're using Apple and Sequoia as an example,
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.100]   you do remember the trajectory of Apple basically went to a $4 billion market cap
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.900]   for years languishing. I mean, the idea that Sequoia would have held those shares because
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.260]   they had some proprietary views ludicrous. Why is it ludicrous? What if they just had a philosophy?
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.380]   That company was on death's doorstep. You can see the YouTube videos when Steve Jobs came back,
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.500]   he said, we may not make it. Yes, but Chamath that in that that is part of the
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.260]   opportunity. But putting that aside, that's exactly what Sequoia is doing is they're saying
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.420]   we want to hold the legendary companies, the legendary brands with the great founders.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.020]   That's all easy in hindsight. How do you do it today?
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:25.500]   Well, is Unity a legendary company? Or should you have distributed at $165 a share?
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.620]   Well, I'm saying
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.900]   That's an extremely hard question.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.620]   And I'm saying you can mitigate that question by pairing your position 10 20%.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.540]   So you have the best of both worlds. So Axe, what do you think?
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.580]   Well, I think it's it's hard to pare down a position while the
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:43.580]   company is still private because the companies don't don't want you to buy and large. But
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:48.700]   but once they do become public, then the question is when you distribute and we talked about this,
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.860]   I think it sounds like SoftBank was sitting on quite a few large public positions
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.860]   and could have distributed I'm not fully familiar with their structure. But given
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:02.460]   that they had all this debt, seems like you'd want to pay off all the debt as soon as you could.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.980]   And missing the chance to do that.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.500]   They had a preferred coupon that
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.620]   they had to pay PIF and an idea every year, I think it's like three or $4 billion. It's well,
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:17.100]   it's documented, but that's the 6% that they that they were owed on their $50 billion.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.580]   But did they pay it off?
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.540]   The
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.060]   way they have to pay it every year.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.660]   Yeah, they did it. I mean, look, I would just say these bubble it's easy,
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:31.180]   you know, hindsight is 2020. It's really easy to point out these mistakes after the markets cratered.
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:37.420]   You know, my experience with these bubbles, whether you go back to 1999, or 2021, is when you're in
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.580]   them, they're very powerful psychologically, you know, everyone's talking about how everything's
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.540]   going up. And we I think actually had some really good commentary on the show about back in November
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:52.300]   about how it could be the peak, how it could be all liquidity fueled. We didn't know for sure. But
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.180]   there were some pretty good predictions on this pod. But by and large, it's it's pretty hard to
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:02.140]   know whether you're you know, whether there are grounding metric that you use,
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.380]   I'll open up to freeberg and then everybody else went to know that the market is
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.500]   overheated. Freeberg is or something you look at and go, okay, we've disconnected from reality,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:18.460]   price to earnings price to sales. Some valuation metrics are the things you look for. So you know
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.020]   that this is overheated, and maybe it is time to pair positions. What would have you learned over
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:30.860]   now, our third collective down market valuation trophy hunting, I would say is a pretty good
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.780]   indicator of things being things being explain what that is in a heated market.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.740]   Like if the
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:47.500]   the businesses, the CEO, the founder, the venture firms, everyone is all about how
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:53.020]   much you can mark up your investment, as opposed to talking about the quality of the business and
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.620]   the quality of the earnings. And then you revert back, as we just recently did to now people
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:04.060]   talking about, okay, how strong are the gross margins of this business? How effectively can
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.460]   they deploy capital? What's the return on invested capital?
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.340]   And then you revert back, as we just recently did to now people talking about how effectively can they deploy capital?
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:13.500]   key metrics around the fundamentals of the business versus the value that the market is willing to pay
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.260]   for the business. And the more heated the market gets, the more everyone focuses on terms like
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   unicorn, deca corn, you know, and that becomes the key metric as opposed to saying this business is
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:32.380]   so good. For every dollar they spend, they make $3 in gross profit in 12 months. That's what
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.140]   fundamentally says that's a high quality growth, you know,
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.660]   you know, valuable business over time, as opposed to here's what the market is telling me it's worth
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.260]   today. And if the market is telling you it's worth that much today, and you're and that's what you
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:53.020]   focus on, you inevitably end up in these kind of bubbly moments where you miss out on focusing on
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.100]   core value creation, which will actually pay off much, much more over time.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.900]   Jim, if you pointed out another signal,
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.820]   hey, when smart people who have the largest amount of capital in the markets are clearing positions,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:11.580]   maybe that's a signal of a top. And then I think is a really good insight by freebird when the
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.300]   conversation the narrative is about the valuation and the status and vanity metrics as opposed to
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.340]   the quality of the earnings. Hey, that's a really good indicator we're in a bubble, maybe you should
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.140]   start clearing positions. What are indications for you that we're either in a bubble or the market is
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.780]   undervalued? Because we're really talking about this timing, right? Timing is very important.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:35.500]   It's not possible. This is why I think that you have to define what game you want to play before
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.580]   you start playing the game. Okay.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:49.820]   This is why I think it's kind of nonsensical. For example, I believe that at best, I am an equity
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:56.940]   investor in technology companies or things that have a technology bias because I can generally
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:04.140]   understand them maybe a few seconds faster than everybody else, which allows me to make a decision
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.180]   a little bit quicker. Okay.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.540]   But if all of a sudden I started investing in debt, you should expect that I'll lose my money
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.580]   because I don't know what I'm doing. And that's not the game where I have any advantage.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.660]   So I think the most important thing to do is to not try to do all of this crazy stuff because this
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:27.740]   is what happens in moments where either things are very, very good or things are very, very bad.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:34.860]   People try to create all these stupid rules. And the rule, the only rule is there are no rules. So I
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.780]   don't know. I just think it's like stick to your knitting. If you're a product builder, build
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:44.860]   products. If you're an early stage investor, just do that. It's hard enough to do any one of those
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:50.860]   things really, really, really well. But this idea that you're going to come up with some mosaic in a
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:56.300]   system, I think it's just highly suspect. And I think the market returns have showed that everybody
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.500]   that tries has failed except for maybe one or two. It's just not going to work. What's the point?
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.540]   So I don't know. If you're an early stage investor, make good deals and then give
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.220]   the shares and book the win. That's what I do. Yeah, that's my philosophy.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.580]   Sax, what are your thoughts? There's a couple of metrics that I'll
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.380]   be looking at from now on that I wasn't paying a huge amount of attention to before.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.820]   One is the price to ARR of the median public SaaS company.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:29.900]   And so like Brad Gerstner has these great charts where you saw that historically that number was
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.220]   around six. The median SaaS company was trading at about six times their next 12 months revenue.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:41.100]   And it went all the way to 15 during this sort of COVID bubble in 2021. And for the high-growth
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:47.340]   SaaS companies, which are the ones growing 40% instead of 20%, it went from like eight to 35.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:53.660]   So I'll definitely be looking at that. And what you're looking for is just how off the historical
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:59.420]   mean are we, positively or negatively, because these public valuations are the exit comps for
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.900]   the private markets. And those valuations do eventually trickle down. And so,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.140]   if there is a bubble in the public markets, it will trickle down to the private markets. So
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.380]   that would be one metric. I mean, again, it's not something that affects me daily,
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.340]   but it's something I'd want to periodically keep tabs on.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:20.380]   The other is just interest rate policy. I mean, I've never spent so much time in my entire career
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:26.540]   looking at inflation and interest rates that I have this year because who knew how much this
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:32.620]   stuff was affecting us? I thought I was a micro investor. I thought I was just picking companies
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.580]   on a micro level. Right.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:40.940]   It turns out we were all massively impacted by macroeconomic policy. And it got so we didn't
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.740]   even notice it. The zero interest rate policy, the ZERP, along with the quantitative easing,
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:51.100]   these were supposed to be exceptional measures that started back in 2008, but we stopped
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:56.940]   noticing them. They continued for years and years and years. They continued until last year. And,
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.180]   again, we just stopped noticing because we got used to it. We kind of got hooked on drugs.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.700]   So the market did.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.260]   Jay Haynes:
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.980]   So I'm just going to have to pay a little bit more attention to what the Fed is doing now.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.020]   And if you go all the way back to the dot-com bubble, what's interesting is that the Fed
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:20.940]   fund rate back in 1999 wasn't low. It was like 4%. It wasn't like it was even today.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.340]   And we still had a bubble. But what popped the bubble was that interest rates went from 4% to 6%
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:32.940]   from 1999 to 2000. That's what popped the bubble. So I don't know if,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.780]   we'll ever have a situation again like we had over the last few years with the ZERP.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:42.460]   But, I mean, probably looking for that next time is fighting the last battle instead of the next
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:47.820]   one. But you do probably have to be a little bit more aware of monetary policy and what the Fed is
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.060]   doing.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.860]   Adam Chapnick:
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:54.300]   Yeah, this chart, Exhibit 6 from the Vision Fund benchmarking against peer funds that Shamath just
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:01.980]   put into the group chat is absolutely spectacular. It puts Sequoia Insight and SoftBank, large funds,
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.460]   Jay Haynes: Yeah.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   Adam Chapnick: against each other. Fund size, $100 billion for SoftBank, $8 billion for Sequoia,
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:14.300]   $6.3 billion for Insight. And to Shamath's point earlier, the pace is really crazy. 130 deals.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:19.100]   Jay Haynes: Three and a half deals per month, but then the average check size is $620 million.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:27.340]   Adam Chapnick: Versus $130 and $70. And the deals per month, $3.5 versus $0.6 versus $4.2. So Insight
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.860]   going pretty fast with small checks. SoftBank going very fast with-
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.140]   Jay Haynes: I think the Sequoia data here-
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:32.700]   Adam Chapnick: Huge checks.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.100]   Jay Haynes: ... is really, Sequoia has the benefit of being able to backtest
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   against 40 years of returns. And so if essentially what they're saying is there's really no more than
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.260]   five or six companies a year that are worth investing in, that's a really big signal that's
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:53.900]   worth thinking about. And so five or six companies, maybe they can absorb even $600 million
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:59.740]   each, it still puts you at three and a half, $4 billion. Doesn't put you at 20, which is what you
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.820]   need to put a hundred into the ground and- Adam Chapnick:
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.380]   $2 billion a month. I mean, my Lord, it's like Brewster's millions or something. It's like some
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.740]   crazy premise. Jay Haynes:
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:14.780]   I think in fairness to SoftBank, again, these are the same guys that invested in Yahoo. They invested
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.980]   in all of these dot-com companies and brought them into Japan, including great businesses like Cisco.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:27.100]   These guys have been big time serial winners. I think the tactical mistake was not having a
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.700]   10-year investment life. Adam Chapnick:
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.660]   And we could be sitting here next year, Alibaba could double in value.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:35.020]   Jay Haynes: A couple of their other positions could recover 50%.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.980]   Adam Chapnick: Probably not.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.420]   Jay Haynes: Okay. But we could be sitting there and they could have closed the gap
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.380]   massively. Anything's possible. I think actually a good jump off point here,
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:51.420]   great discussion, gentlemen. Do we want to talk about the markets? We got the inflation print,
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   Sachs. I guess, depending on what political party you're in, it's either 8.5% or zero,
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.340]   0% month over month. If you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican, it's 8.5%.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.300]   Jay Haynes: 8.5% in our polarized times.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:11.500]   But what does this tell us, Sachs, just at least about maybe inflation is tipped over and we're
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.860]   going to be flat for a little bit. That obviously caused the market to rip a little bit. And we had
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:24.300]   this incredible jobs report. We're now at 3.5% unemployment and twice as many jobs as we
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.100]   predicted. It's pretty extraordinary what happened in the last 30 days to these prints.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.580]   Sachs:
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.180]   Yeah. Look, I think that, over the last 30 days, we've had a lot of jobs that have been
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.260]   cut off. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:37.100]   Overall, the economic data is mixed, but we got a couple of good data points in the last month.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:46.300]   So inflation did decrease from 9.1% to 8.5%. Inflation was, until now, measured on a year
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:51.260]   over year basis, not a month over month basis. But since we got the first good month over month
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.580]   reading, all of a sudden now, it's been redefined to be on a month over month basis. Just this is
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:01.020]   the same thing that happened with the definition of recession, where recession used to mean two
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:07.100]   quarters of negative GDP growth. Of course, that happened. And so all of a sudden, the definition
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.540]   became unknowable. We have to defer to this economic board that won't render a decision
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.340]   until next year. By the way, if that were true, how could we ever contemporaneously talk about
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:22.700]   a recession? If you had to wait until this economics board declares recession a year from
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.700]   now, the press could never have ever reported on a recession.
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.100]   I, for one, am shocked. Yeah, I'm shocked. Politicians are spinning.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.860]   So look, the politics of this are obvious, which is they keep redefining terms,
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.700]   rather than admit that there's any bad data at all.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.780]   That's mixed. Now, look, I don't think the data is
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:43.180]   catastrophic. I don't think it's in anyone's interest to catastrophize the data. But there's
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.380]   a lot of negative data out here. I mean, look, inflation is still very high, 8.5%. If you had
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:54.060]   told any of us that in August, that inflation would still be 8.5% at the beginning of this year,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.100]   we would have said that is horrible. Because remember, the investment banks
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.700]   were all saying it's going to come down to 3% by the end of the year.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:06.620]   So inflation is still high. The jobs picture is good. We're technically in a recession.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.780]   If I were to predict, I think what's going to happen now, I think, you know, look for a double
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:17.180]   dip. I wouldn't be surprised at all if in Q3 or Q4, we're back to positive GDP growth. But I don't
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:22.700]   think we're necessarily out of the woods because I think there's a pretty good chance that next year,
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:28.220]   these rate hikes really kick in. It takes six to nine months for them to ripple through the
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.540]   economy. So if you look at the construction industry,
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.020]   the construction industry has just been devastated. New housing starts, you talk to the
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.820]   builders, they tell you that the construction industry has just been clobbered by these rate
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:45.100]   hikes. The inventories are piling up. And the affordability of there's a chart today about
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:51.420]   the affordability of home prices at a 40 year low. And so the construction industry, it's really the
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.540]   bellwether when a recession starts, they're the ones who are first impacted. But it's probably
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.820]   going to take six to nine months. Because the loans are so expensive.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.420]   And cost of capital is expensive. Right? projects.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.100]   Yeah. So look, I if I take, I think we're in a shallow technical recession right now,
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.060]   I bet that we probably bounce out of it in Q3 or Q4. But I think there's a significant risk that
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.420]   we're back in. We're back in it next year. Just my guess.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.540]   Freiburg, we've been talking about consumer credit a whole bunch,
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.140]   buy now pay later. Household debt now totals more than 16 trillion credit card balances,
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.220]   make up 890 billion of that obviously, student loans, mortgages, other things
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:37.820]   are in there. And the number of credit cards is now at a massive high 550 million of them issued
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:44.380]   here in the United States. We added a massive amount of debt, it's still lower, the credit
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.460]   card debt, just to be clear, is still lower than the pre pandemic level of 930 billion.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.420]   But consumers seem to be taking out credit, I guess to deal with inflation or to enjoy
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.060]   their lives, because they're not stopping their spending. And we see that in some of the
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.660]   stocks and the earnings reports that are coming out as well. So what's your what's your take on
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.620]   this, you know, conflicting data we have? Or is or have you made some sense of it? And what is your
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.180]   prediction of q4? Sorry, are you asking what my take is on the consumer credit?
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.220]   Well, basically, the overall macro situation here, we've got consumer credit,
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.540]   you know, people taking on a lot of debt, while jobs look great,
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.820]   while inflation is still high. What does that look like? You know, as we go into q4,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.900]   and next year, what is this telling you? Is there some signaling you can take from this?
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:35.820]   I mean, Sachs said shallow recession thinks we might double dip, I'm kind of getting to your
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.740]   prediction of q4. I mean, this is a little repetitive. I mean, I've said this, I first
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.940]   said it in May at the all in summit, and I said it again on the show twice. Great, which is I think
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   that the definition of a recession of negative GDP growth when you're coming off of inflated GDP is,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:59.740]   you know, it's not a binary catch all term. I mean, the fact is, we had inflated assets and
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.500]   as a result of inflated assets, we had inflated earnings, and we had inflated valuation,
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:09.020]   we inflated income. And, you know, now, the capital is coming out and things are going to go
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:14.380]   down inevitably. But I don't think that this should be deemed that there's something fundamentally
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:20.380]   negative about the US economy. The biggest risk I still see is this rising consumer credit balance,
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.460]   particularly in a rising rate environment. People are taking on more debt. If you look at the New
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:29.580]   York Fed here, I'll just give you the latest. This is the health and safety of the United
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.740]   States. This is the household debt and credit report they put out household debt rises to
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.860]   $16 trillion in the growth in housing and non housing balances. And so there are variable
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:45.500]   rate loans in there in the auto, home and credit card markets. Those variable rates mean that as
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.140]   interest rates climb, the amount to service existing debt will go up each month.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.860]   And the amount of debt that's being taken on is also going up each month.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.420]   And so the key economic question is does the income gain that's
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:06.460]   being experienced or the asset value gain that's being experienced outpace the increase in monthly
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.220]   debt service needed for a large number of consumers? Student loans are also in here,
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.180]   by the way. And so when you put that all together, it's a very technical question,
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.740]   which is technically where do you start to see defaults rise? And when you have defaults rise,
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.260]   then the money that's owed and the services that are the service payments that are owed
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   on that debt, trickles through the economy because bonds start to default, equity start
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:35.820]   to decline and so on. So this is why I can speak at a high level from a macro point of view,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:41.100]   that the rate at which debt is going up and consumer credit is going up and the rate at
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:47.980]   which rates are climbing that affect the revolving and variable rate debt that consumers hold
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:53.100]   could outpace the income and the asset value gain, particularly when equities are down,
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:58.380]   401ks are down, housing prices are down. And so there's a tipping point. And
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:04.460]   when that starts to happen, then you start to really hit an economic crunch. And I've mentioned
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.460]   this multiple times now that it's the thing, you know, I would kind of watch most closely,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.940]   while there are core elements of the current economy that looks strong,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:18.780]   there are real concerns around whether consumers can keep up with their debt payments
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.260]   in the months and quarters ahead. Yeah. Chamath, are you following this consumer
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:28.380]   credit surge? And do you think that this could be a black swan type event? This could be, you know,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.820]   a major headline? Well, it's no black swan because it's right here in front of us. So,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:36.700]   you know, okay. Yeah, yeah. I would say like a massive contagion where there's massive number
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.580]   of defaults creating a black swan contagion like event. But yes, so it's, it's not it's maybe hidden
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.060]   in plain sight. What do you think Chamath? Is this important data or impacting your view on things?
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:52.780]   Yeah, I think it's important. It's part of a mosaic. And I don't I don't really know. Look,
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:58.300]   what are we trying to get from this discussion? I don't understand like, like, are we trying to
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:58.780]   predict what's going to happen? Are we trying to predict what's going to happen? Are we trying to
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:05.420]   predict what's going to happen? I mean, I think David basically said it best, like, if you actually
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:11.820]   just take a step back and stop overlaying what we want to happen, look, the reality is all four of
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:17.260]   us want things to go up. And we like it when there's money in the system and everything's flush.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:23.100]   But if we had said last year that we would open an envelope, and you know, we would show these
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.300]   inflation prints, we would be shocked and we would have been scared. And quite honestly, you know, in
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:28.620]   the process, we would have been scared. And quite honestly, you know, in the process,
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:35.500]   in November, when I started selling, I would have sold even more violently than I sold. And
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:40.380]   all I can say is I saved my ass in November of last year, looking at what's happened in the last
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:46.620]   six, eight months. So I don't know, I just think that if you look at the CPI print,
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:53.980]   and you look at the components, we were saved, because energy basically fell off a cliff.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:58.460]   And for whatever reason, a bunch of people decided not to travel.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.340]   And, you know, we didn't import as much oil, and we were able to keep costs contained.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.060]   And that kept CPI from being really out of control.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:12.700]   But again, we're in the summer where we don't have the pressure on energy that we're going to have in
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:18.620]   October, November this year. So I really don't know. I mean, I just think that there is like,
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:23.100]   Freeberg has his pet issue, I have my pet issue, Sachs has his pet issue,
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:28.300]   you ask 100 economists, they'll have their own pet issue, housing, affordability, whatever it is, the
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:36.140]   point is, we have 100 whack-a-mole problems. And the question is, which mousetrap sets off the rest
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:44.380]   of the mousetraps? I have no idea. And so, you know, I just think that right now things are a
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.780]   little bit too calm. And that makes me feel very unsettled.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.540]   Another shoe might drop. I mean, the point of the conversation is to try to understand and make
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:57.340]   better decisions in capital allocation, company formation, and placing bets in the next year. So
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.100]   that's the point of the discussion.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:07.180]   We now have the spectacle of the president saying he's going to pass an inflation reduction act
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:13.980]   to solve a 0% inflation problem to get us out of a recession that he says doesn't exist.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.460]   You guys know this, but the politics and the political commentary on this are absurd.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:24.220]   I think what we're describing here is simply more honest, which is to say that the data is mixed,
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.740]   and we don't exactly know what's going to happen.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.700]   The thing that I think is encouraging is when you look at this jobs data,
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:37.740]   and you look at the debt that consumers are putting on, my theory is, and I could be wrong,
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.980]   that people want to keep spending. They want to keep living their lives. They're taking on a
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.260]   little bit of debt to deal with inflation and to keep spending, but they're also going back
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.020]   to work. And I'm seeing that anecdotally, a lot more people going back to work, and the numbers
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:53.420]   show that. That feels to me, and I said this on previous episodes, that that feels like a possible,
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.820]   you know, very helpful path out here. And I think you brought it up, Sax, as well, which is, hey, if we
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:02.860]   have increased participation, that's great, increases monetary velocity, increases participation
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.820]   in the economy. That's a possible path out. Do you feel like that's still holding strong?
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:14.380]   Even in secular decline on that trend for 25 years. So maybe on the margins, a few folks
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:21.100]   run out of stimulus and decide to go and get a job. But I don't think, again, it's kind of like,
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:27.660]   you know, when you're at the blackjack table in Vegas, and somebody's clapping.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.500]   Clapping is not a strategy. I feel like all the, like, what we're talking about right now is
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:36.140]   clapping as a strategy. Maybe this can happen. Maybe that can happen. You know what? Maybe it'll
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.380]   start raining gold fucking coins that we can use and just not have to worry about.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:45.420]   Yeah, I mean, J. Cal, I feel like the last 15 minutes have been, like, not a good conversation.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.220]   I think it's totally repetitive.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.340]   Well, I think it's a great conversation.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.260]   No, listen, I think it's totally repetitive. It's totally repetitive, J. Cal, because,
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.780]   look, the structure of the problem, I think, is very well defined, which is we have an inflation
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:03.180]   problem. Great. It went down from 9.1 to 8.5%. It's still really high. 2% to 3% would be normal.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:08.540]   Okay. So that's half the problem is how fast is inflation going to go back down to normal
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.580]   based on interest rate cuts? The other side of the problem is-
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.060]   Increases.
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.820]   Is, sorry, interest rate increases, not cuts. The other side of the problem is
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:21.900]   how much will the economy be hurt by these rising rates? And those are the two variables. And we see
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.620]   that there is a slowdown. There's still a lot of jobs being filled, which is good. But there is, on
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:32.060]   a question, an economic slowdown. And those are the two sides of this equation. And we just need
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.940]   to see some economic data. It's going to play out over the next several months.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.300]   You've been asking the same question for three fucking weeks.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.140]   If you guys don't want to talk about the new data, that's fine.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.660]   Hey, who cares? It's like we just-
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.820]   None of us care. None of us care.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.900]   None of us, we don't have an opinion other than we don't know. How many ways can we say we don't know,
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.300]   J. Cal?
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.660]   I don't want to talk about inflation or recession or jobs or any of that shit anymore,
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.740]   unless there's something really for us all to say, like something news come out, like some fucking
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.460]   economic report. Well, I mean, the job load-
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.900]   That report was really important. I mean, that was a massive print, but okay.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:00.380]   It's not. It's not that-
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.660]   Oh yeah, twice as many jobs-
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:02.780]   It is. Twice as many jobs.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.740]   But it's on the track of what we've already said.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.900]   It's one data point. It's one data point.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:06.620]   It's on the track.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.820]   And you know what? There were some bad jobs reports before that print.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.900]   I think we should stop doing the recession inflation chat every week. It honestly is
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.220]   repetitive.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.660]   You have a better job moderating. Can you not dial it in?
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.780]   You guys, no, you guys asked to talk about it. You guys put some of these things on the docket.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.940]   No, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I think we should cut that shit.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.180]   Let's move on. What do you want to move on to next?
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.220]   I think SoftBank was a great chat. I think, you know, that was a good talk. We should do
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.260]   that kind of shit. We should talk about-
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.020]   I want to know what you guys think about the Sequoia Evergreen Fund. Tell me what you guys
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.620]   think about that. Come on, geniuses.
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.820]   The Sequoia, like when they restructured? Are you joking?
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.260]   I love when these two go silent.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.220]   No, no. I always didn't want to interrupt anybody.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.180]   I don't understand what you're saying.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:50.540]   I don't understand why you guys are trying so hard to avoid the obvious news of this week.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.140]   Was there something else in the news this week?
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.940]   Sacks, if Trump actually
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:03.500]   had some material in Mar-a-Lago that was related to the nuclear program, and, you know, there was
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:09.420]   an attempt to try and recover those documents through normal means, and they were not recoverable,
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:13.260]   what would your course have been if you were the director of the FBI or the president of the US
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.380]   in that condition? Because I think that seems to be the party line of what's going on here.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.380]   Well, you know-
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.300]   The Democratic kind of spin on what's going on here. But like, you know,
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.700]   honestly, in that circumstance, what do you think would have been a pretty good thing?
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.500]   I think it would have been appropriate. So there's some sort of confidential material related to our
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:33.020]   nuclear program, or nuclear weapons, something there in those materials that were attempted to
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.740]   be recovered, or were taken without approval, and then they try to recover it. For, you know,
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.820]   assume there's no nefarious intent, what would be the right kind of course here?
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:50.300]   Well, so I don't know exactly what's going on. I just think that you can't necessarily give the F,
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.460]   sadly, I don't think you can necessarily give the FBI the benefit of the doubt here in light of their history.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.700]   But let's back up. I mean, first, you had this raid on Mar-a-Lago where you got
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.340]   30 FBI agents. They're not wearing suits with holstered sidearms. They're carrying
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:08.540]   AR-15s, you know, weapons of war, fingers just outside the trigger guard. They're wearing body
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:13.180]   armor. It looks like a paramilitary raid on Mar-a-Lago. It's utterly unprecedented.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:19.500]   And you look at tweets by Andrew Cuomo, for example, or Andrew Yang. I mean,
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.220]   these guys actually turn out to be pretty, I think, intellectually honest Democrats on this point.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.380]   Saying this is unprecedented and it's really going to, here, I want to read this by Andrew Yang.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.420]   Why don't you answer Freeberg's question?
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:36.140]   I'm getting there. I know you're going to cut me off, so I'd like to just read these tweets.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.140]   So maybe you, because, you know, maybe you'll give more credence to Andrew Yang. He said,
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.380]   "I'm no Trump fan. I want him as far away from the White House as possible. But a fundamental part of
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:48.940]   his appeal has been that it's him against a corrupt government establishment. This raid strengthens
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.980]   that case for millions of Americans who will see this as unjust persecution." You have Andrew Cuomo
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.740]   saying, "DOJ must immediately explain the reason for its raid. It must be more than a search for
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:02.220]   inconsequential archives or be viewed as a political tactic and undermine any future credible
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.900]   investigation and legitimacy of January 6th investigations." And let me read one other tweet
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:13.740]   by Elon that's not directly about this, but he tweeted this on July 11th, so a month ago. And
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:18.540]   he said, "I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail at the sunset."
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:23.740]   That was the part that was widely reported. But he also said, "Dem should also call off the attack.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:28.300]   Don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the presidency." I think there was
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:34.380]   a lot of wisdom in that. And you know, I'm old enough to remember when the case for Biden getting
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:42.540]   elected is we have to move past this partisan warfare, this extreme rancor and derangement.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:48.060]   And we were told that the media, you know, all these people who had TDS, that their psychosis
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:53.500]   was due to Trump. And if we could just move past Trump, this, all this sort of partisan warfare,
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:59.500]   would end. And now, and I was certainly hoping that would be true. And now, sadly, it seems like
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:06.140]   we're right back in this thing, where we're right back with the media being obsessed with TDS,
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:10.700]   portraying this narrative that somehow he's a traitor. And what does this whole thing hang on?
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:16.380]   Just these two words, nuclear documents. Well, listen, until they actually produce those documents,
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:23.260]   I'm going to suspend judgment. Because the FBI, the last time they did this, remember, they manufactured a falsified
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:31.020]   warrant to the FISA court for this type of investigation. They have that history. So I'm
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:36.380]   just going to suspend judgment on what's going on here until they actually produce the documents
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:41.980]   they're talking about. Can I ask, right now this stinks. Do you honestly question the integrity of
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:48.620]   leadership and agents of the FBI? Are you serious? Like you don't think? Yeah. All right. Let me read
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:52.380]   you this tweet from Michael Burry. I don't want to hear the tweet. I want to hear your point. Well,
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.940]   I agree with what Michael Burry is saying. So I think sometimes there's a lot of thoughtful
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:02.060]   commentary about this. And what Burry says is J. Edgar Hoover led the FBI for five decades,
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:06.940]   denied the mafia existed, fought the civil rights movement, shielded the KKK. Multiple
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:11.660]   presidents acknowledged fear of him. So what he's saying is that the FBI, since its inception,
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:18.460]   has political origins and basically meddled politically in the affairs of the country.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.780]   Then he says the FBI lied to the FISA court. This is back in 2016. Totally
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:28.140]   true. Altered emails, leaked lies to the press to get Trump. Nothing shocking. So,
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:32.460]   Freeberg, listen, I don't know whether the FBI is telling the truth, but are you honestly going to
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:37.740]   say that the FBI's leadership has never been political, that has never harbored or pursued
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.540]   their own agenda, and that it's never had a desire to go after Trump? I'm not making an opinion.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:48.780]   Hold on a second. We saw the text messages from Comey, Strzok, Page, McCabe.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.540]   I mean, these guys basically took it upon themselves when Trump was elected,
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.100]   to be the quote unquote insurance policy. Yeah.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:56:03.500]   And an FBI lawyer pled guilty to falsifying documents to seek a warrant from the FISA court.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:09.180]   So I just think anything's possible here. And now I'm not saying the FBI is lying about this.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.100]   I don't know. But the idea that the FBI is automatically entitled
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:17.260]   to the benefit of the doubt in light of their proven history of basically
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:22.300]   pursuing Trump like Ahab pursued the white whale. I mean, these guys have
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.900]   have been after him. I'm just going to zoom out for a second. The reason I'm interrogating
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:31.740]   Sachs on this is like, it's just so telling to me that a guy like like you, Sachs, in your position
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:39.660]   are actually questioning the integrity of like the highest justice authority and institution in the
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:47.580]   United States really says a lot about kind of the state of the US citizenry, the state of our
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:52.060]   society today. I think it speaks a lot to... It's at least a third of Americans. I know. It's incredible.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:56.860]   It's incredible. And what Ray Dalio said in his book about how during these periods when the
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.900]   empires begin their decline, and you know, when you're challenged with kind of the economic
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:06.300]   conditions that the US is challenged by printing lots of money, lots of debt, very hard to service
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:10.380]   all that debt. And we have a ton of obligations over the next decade or two that are going to be
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:15.980]   very hard to meet given our economic growth and inflation conditions right now, that you start
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:21.820]   to see these sorts of behaviors historically. It's happened six times in the last 500 years where large
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.860]   empires like the United States or large, you know, economic powerhouses like the United States start
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:33.660]   to decline, that the civil war begins, that the institutions get challenged by a minority and then
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:39.820]   a majority of the citizenry. And it really starts to crumble and challenge the integrity of the
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:44.060]   institution and its ability to hold itself together. I'm not... Hold on a second. I'm not
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:47.820]   challenging... Hold on a second. I'm not... Well, you're questioning the integrity. You're questioning
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.580]   the integrity of the Department of Justice, right? Listen, I... By the way, I'm not arguing. I'm just pointing out
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:57.420]   like it's an incredible condition for us to find ourselves in. Yeah, but I... But my questioning did
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:04.460]   not create that condition. This lack of trust is earned. It's earned by the FBI in light of behaviors
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:10.860]   they took just a few years ago. Now, listen, I'm not defending Trump per se. I don't know what he did
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:21.340]   or didn't do, okay? But I think that you can't just accept at face value without further proof these
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:27.820]   leaked... What are basically leaked comments by the FBI. Yeah. I mean, look, I'm not... Listen, I'm not a naive
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:34.300]   child. I mean, the fact of the matter is that power can be corrupt and power corrupts, okay? And we have
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:40.540]   seen that the FBI from its earliest days did engage in corruption and more recently against Trump
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:45.820]   himself had a vendetta against Trump. So, I'm simply... So, hold on. So, all I'm doing is
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:51.100]   I'm not going to automatically accept at face value what they're saying until
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.940]   I see some proof. Now, I'm not saying that they're wrong or they're lying about this.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:59:00.380]   I'm simply saying I'm not going to accept it at face value. Yeah, and remember, Trump was elected
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:06.380]   on the platform that there is this deep state, that there is institutional corruption,
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:11.500]   that there is malaise and lethargy in these institutions of the government that are funded
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.300]   on the order of trillions of dollars a year, and that that's what he was intended to, you know,
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:20.860]   to go and blow up and repair. And there's a very strong and potentially
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:26.140]   close to majority percentage of voting Americans that feel that there is this core deep state
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:31.820]   corruption, institutional lethargy that is challenging our ability to give everyone the
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.260]   freedom and liberties that they deserve. Freebird, these agencies are supposed to
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:39.660]   be nonpartisan. They're not supposed to have a horse in the race. And what we saw is that when
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:46.140]   Trump was in office and these texts came out, clearly the top levels of the FBI, these top
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:50.620]   agents, I'm not talking about the rank and file, I'm not talking about the field agents, I understand
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:54.220]   that a lot of them are law and order types who vote Republican, I get it. But I'm talking about
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:58.060]   the leadership, the highly political leadership in Washington. And it was pretty clear that they
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:03.580]   had a horse in the race. They did not like Trump and they were out to get Trump. And, you know,
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:10.540]   again, Trump is not my preferred candidate for 2024. But what the FBI has done with this raid,
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.940]   quite frankly, I think has polarized the outcomes. They are basically going to send Trump to the big
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:20.380]   house or the White House. I mean, because now the Republicans have rallied around Trump. I think he
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:27.180]   is going to be very, very hard to beat for as the nominee in 2024, unless the FBI comes up with
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:31.020]   ironclad evidence to show that he did something significantly wrong.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.020]   I care less about who did what and what was done wrong. I care more about the fact that this
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:40.940]   conflict is escalating, and it's creating a real condition of continuing polarization. And it
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:45.820]   really is the conditioning that you know, Biden had some historians in the White House, there was
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:50.140]   a report on this last week. And these historians spoke about how the conditions in the United States
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:55.020]   are just as they were right before the Civil War. And, and that there's real concern.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:55.980]   I've heard how that?
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:02.060]   Yeah, well, I mean, you know, they can go read the anecdotal reporting that was done on this thing.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.700]   But that was the general theme of the conversation. And, you know, it really,
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:13.180]   it really kind of concerns me more that this level of discourse is escalating to a point of,
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:19.420]   you know, there's corruption, this person is a criminal, and that sort of discussion happens.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:27.340]   You know, in more dire circumstances, and more economic circumstances than has ever been seen,
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:31.500]   you know, the US is the largest economy in history. And we're now having these sorts of
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.020]   conversations that typically lead to some degree of conflict. And it's really concerning.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.260]   Well, I just think, listen, I think that Trump was out of office,
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.780]   we were told that this partisan rancor would stop once he was out.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   And it's, you know, they're pulling him back in. And all I can say is that when the I think we know
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.300]   that Trump is out of office, we're going to have to take a look at the next step. And I think that's
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.060]   going to be a very important step for the United States. And I think that's going to be a very,
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.340]   very important step for the United States. And I think that's what we need to do. And I think that's
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.100]   going to be a very important step for the United States. And I think that's going to be a very,
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.940]   very important step for the United States. And I think that's going to be a very, very important step.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:05.180]   And I'm suspending judgment, what I'm saying is though that when all the information comes out,
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.900]   there better be a very significant there there.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:12.140]   No, no, no, we've made that impossible, too, because he Trump came out and he basically said,
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:17.900]   Hey, listen, if you if these guys find something, it was planted. And now you're gonna have at least
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.380]   a, you know, 10 or 15% of the population that believes, okay, this was planted, it wasn't
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:28.380]   actually there. And, you know, so whatever the outcome is, will not be good, nobody will be
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:35.260]   satisfied. And both both of the extremes in the United States will be even more angry,
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.220]   they're inflamed. Yeah.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.300]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.660]   The inflammatory index has now has now skyrocketed. Yeah.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.900]   By the way, this is why I think at some level,
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.660]   maybe the lack of faith in these institutions is well deserved.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:54.220]   Because where is the, the, you know, the prudence of all of this, like, where is the
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:03:02.060]   circumspect, thoughtful, methodical thinking about all of the different outcomes that could be
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:09.340]   possible, so that you exhaust every option, and this is the only option left. And then even then,
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:16.140]   if Merrick Garland was open to basically saying unseal the warrant, why didn't you do it before
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.420]   and say, we're going to have to do this.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.380]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.340]   I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.260]   I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.340]   There's all kinds of things you could have done.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:27.500]   Oh, clearly, they did keep the hold on a second to keep the temperature of this thing
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.740]   way, way down. And that's what
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.940]   to your point, Shamath, they could have let Trump's lawyers watch them
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.900]   do the search so that nobody could claim anything about anything being planted.
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.340]   Yeah. So they didn't let that happen either.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:43.180]   Inflammatory index is spiking. I think that's my key takeaway on all of this.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:47.180]   I care less about what Trump did and what the DOJ did.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.700]   You're right. And you know, when you're more concerned about where this takes us,
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.700]   because the next step, regardless of where it takes us, you know where it takes us. When you're
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.580]   on tilt at the poker table, what do you do? You cannot think properly. That's right. And so when
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:04.540]   everyone's out right now, when people are so inflamed with emotion, they start to make very
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:09.740]   poor decisions. I don't know whether the DOJ and main justice made a poor decision or not.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.700]   I think this is where we have to hold our breath and hope they didn't.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.940]   I don't know whether the White House knew anything or not. But the
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:24.540]   whole point of all of this is that we pulled this guy right back in to the main stage.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.900]   Absolutely. I mean, like I said, you've polarized the outcomes.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.420]   You're either going to basically send this guy to jail or you're going to send him to the White
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:37.900]   House. No, I think there's very likely a middle path where nothing happens, but it will further
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:42.620]   erode what Freiburg says, which is it's just a little bit less trust in the DOJ.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.700]   Institutional integrity is eroding. And when institutional integrity erodes,
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:52.540]   the fabric of what keeps everything working starts to fall apart. And I'm not saying this
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.660]   is some cataclysmic civil war happening. Just to be clear, I'm not saying there's
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:01.180]   some cataclysmic civil war happening next year, but it's an unfortunate decline in everyone's
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:06.380]   faith and the stability of the institutions that we all rely on to support and service us,
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.820]   because the inflammatory index is going to go up and everyone's going to be criticizing everything.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:10.700]   And that's a nasty place to be.
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.820]   This is why I think we really have to ask, was this really necessary?
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.460]   I mean, why did the DOJ and the FBI think this was necessary?
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.020]   I think the judges were just sitting there.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:24.540]   I think that's a reasonable question. If these things were actually sitting in a box with a lock
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.780]   that they changed, there must have been something more that was so grievous
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.700]   where you had to do something like this. Now, by the way, David, I just want to…
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.700]   I read, so I don't know if it's true or not. I think maybe it was in Barry Weiss's
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.700]   sub-stack or Matt Taibbi's sub-stack. These folks weren't armed to the teeth. They came in
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:45.180]   jeans and shorts and t-shirts. In fact, main justice told them, do it as low as possible.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.220]   No, I've seen the photos.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:52.060]   No, no, you saw the photos outside. I'm saying the people inside were there for six or seven hours
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.580]   and only a few people knew about it.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.740]   They were there for nine hours. They basically told Trump's people they couldn't be there.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:02.540]   They had to leave. They told them to turn the cameras off. And they had like highly militarized
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:07.020]   guys. There were something like 40 people and something like 30 of them were heavily armed.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.380]   The optics were terrible.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.260]   If there was some confidential nuclear material
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.980]   in Mar-a-Lago and through normal means of communication, they had asked several times to
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.380]   have it returned and identified this for him. And he had refused, which I think is a very reasonable
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.820]   conditioning for what may have happened here. And then they said, okay, we got to go get it.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:30.140]   There's no choice. This is like super confidential nuclear material. We got to get this stuff.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.100]   The only way to get it is to serve a warrant and go in there and get it.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:39.100]   Under those circumstances, do you think that this would have been kind of inappropriate?
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:43.580]   Assume all other kind of communication means were exhausted. What would you have done if
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.220]   you were president?
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.740]   Listen, I think there is information.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.460]   I think there is information that could still come out to convince me that this
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:53.980]   raid was warranted. I just haven't seen that information yet. And I think the optics of it
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:58.300]   were terrible. I liked the point I was making. I don't know why it wouldn't have been good enough
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:05.500]   to send in the FBI agents with holstered sidearms, you know, not AR-15 weapons of war, you know,
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.580]   where the fingers were just outside the trigger guard. It looked like a paramilitary raid.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:12.860]   So whoever was thinking about the political ramifications of this clearly didn't do a
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.540]   very good job. I also don't know.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.500]   Even through the optics. Yeah.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:20.380]   Yeah. I also don't know why you wouldn't give the courtesy to a former president of the United
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:27.740]   States to give them either more of a heads up or to let his lawyers attend so that just for their
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:31.900]   own protection. So they can't be accused of planning anything that would have been smart.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.300]   And I don't know why they would have said to Trump's people that they couldn't record it.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.780]   And I don't know why there's been reports that the FBI went through Melania's closet. I mean,
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:45.260]   seriously, they're like going through Melania's clothes. It's just weird. It's weird. So there's
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:50.940]   a lot about this that we don't know. I'm not conclusively rendering judgment about it because
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:55.100]   there are things that absolutely could come out to convince me that it was warranted,
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.300]   but I haven't heard them yet.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.780]   Okay, everybody, we'll see you on the next episode of the All In podcast. Love you, besties.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.660]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.540]   Rain Man, David Sacks.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:13.260]   And instead, we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.140]   Love you, besties.
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.020]   I'm the queen of Kimmel.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.740]   I'm the queen of Kimmel.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.020]   I'm going all in.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.620]   What your winners ride.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.700]   What your winners ride.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.700]   What your winners ride.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   Besties are gone.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.700]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.700]   Wait, no, no.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.700]   Oh, man.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.700]   My ambitash will meet me at what it's called.
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.700]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.700]   It's like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.700]   Wet your feet.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.780]   Wet your feet.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:46.380]   Wet your feet.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.740]   We need to get merchies.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.900]   I'm going all in.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:59.340]   I'm going all in.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.400]   you
