[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.400]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.220]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.500]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.200]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.160]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.040]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.280]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.520]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.920]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.520]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520]   Well, listeners, I'm super excited about this week's podcast.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.160]   We're gonna be talking about morning time,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.880]   what in the world that is,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.320]   and how useful that is for our families
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.320]   as we all work to develop our family rhythms,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.920]   how we make it through the day,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.760]   how we travel along this homeschool journey,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.200]   and how we build closer relationships.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.160]   Learning together, I will tell you,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.200]   as I look in the rear view mirror now,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.520]   my girls are grown, and I have two sweet grandchildren
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.440]   that I'm looking forward to dabbling
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.520]   in their home educations.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   But as I look back, the biggest blessing of my life
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.440]   has been learning to know and love my children
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.400]   and introduce them to my Lord.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   And so I am excited about talking to you guys
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.200]   and my dear friend, Amy Jones, about morning time
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.040]   and how it helps us do all that stuff,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.440]   love one another better, love the Lord better,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.640]   love learning better.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.520]   So Amy, thank you for joining me today.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.360]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   This is always a delightful time to just reflect,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   like you just said, on those memories
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.080]   and try to encapsulate just what has been
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   sort of the heartbeat, right,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.600]   of what our time with our family,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   what I think I am usually now even more grateful
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.480]   for those, just those, even those boring days,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.200]   you know, I'm so thankful.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   I'm just, I can't imagine having not homeschooled my children
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.080]   and just have that much intimate time with them.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   So yes, I agree with you.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.920]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.840]   It's just a great time to reminisce a bit.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.680]   So thank you.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.600]   - It is.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   And the truth is sometimes there are days
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.080]   when you are in the middle of things that are not pretty
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.240]   or not restful or not fun.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.840]   And you just think there has got to be something better.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.240]   But I promise you moms and dads, as you look back,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.920]   there probably won't be anything better.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   The worst day that you ever have investing in your family
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.480]   is going to be a sweet memory when you look back on it.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.840]   Let's get started though.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.760]   Amy, you are a mom who homeschooled
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.960]   and you are a grandmom who loves joining in
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.480]   on your grandkids' homeschool journey.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.200]   So I know you've got lots of tips for our listeners.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.120]   I really want to plumb your brain.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.960]   I want to ask you this question.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.280]   If you were starting over now,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   given all that you know, what might you do differently?
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.400]   - Well, we have a limited time, don't we, Lisa?
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920]   - Yes, I know.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.880]   You have to pick and choose.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.120]   - I have to pick.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   I think I would be better at practicing a few habits
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   that would have helped me remember the goodness of God
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.960]   and remind me that my children are human beings.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.240]   They're real people.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.800]   They have real personalities and likes, dislikes.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.360]   Some of them are not mine.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.080]   They're not just little replicas of me or my husband.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   And I think I would have been more quicker to recognize
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.800]   just some of those delightful foibles, maybe.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   - Yes, yes.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.040]   - And not let it produce anxiety
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.160]   if they weren't getting something right away.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.960]   So I think I remember just going to the Lord and saying,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.040]   what am I supposed to do?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.480]   I don't know what to do because they're,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.960]   especially when your children are in multiple grades
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.720]   and they're all doing something different
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.040]   and you're trying to keep up and remember,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.880]   oh, I didn't do spelling last year.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.000]   Maybe I should be.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.680]   (both laughing)
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.800]   He brought me to that wonderful,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.000]   simple set of verses in First Thessalonians.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.480]   And I know you know it.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.560]   And it's in five and he goes,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.480]   "Well, what is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you?"
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.760]   And it's three things.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   It's rejoice always, pray without ceasing
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.880]   and give thanks in all circumstances.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.320]   And I think I would have started practicing those verses
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.760]   in real time earlier.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.400]   I would have recognized,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.440]   I think when we're giving thanks to the Lord,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   we begin to recognize and pick up
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.280]   on how he's actually working in our home, our life,
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.680]   our marriage, our children's lives.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.760]   We get to start recognizing,
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.040]   oh, thank you, Lord, for that.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.160]   Thank you for this.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   And I recognize that you are actively working in our lives
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.640]   and hearts and minds in ways that I cannot do.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   So I think giving thanks opens our hands to his ways.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.360]   And we can even be thankful for things
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.880]   that we're still on the fence about.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.760]   - Or things that we don't understand
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   or that we would not choose.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.200]   - I think it helps us just to be mindful of his presence
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.840]   that's constantly with us.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.360]   And then rejoicing,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.320]   there's so many pieces of scripture that says rejoice.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.000]   And it's just irregardless of circumstances,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.480]   what's going on in the world
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   or what's going on in our family,
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.160]   that he gives us the freedom.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.960]   I think he gives us the pleasure of just rejoicing.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.000]   And I think part of that is such a gift for us
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.960]   that it means we don't have to worry or stress
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.200]   about things that are out of our control,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.640]   that we can rest in God and rejoice in his goodness,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.880]   his kindness.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   And it helps us recognize parts of himself that I forget,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.080]   especially during the day.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.800]   Sometimes I forget his goodness, his kindness.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.240]   And then of course,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.760]   that just leads directly into pray without ceasing.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.600]   Because if you're thinking and rejoicing
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.320]   while you're in prayer,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   and I do think a lot of times,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.760]   I think I could have allayed a lot of my anxiety
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.320]   and put it into prayer.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.120]   Instead of the work of anxiety,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.640]   I could have moved that to the work of prayer.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.680]   And I think I would have,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.320]   I mean, over time, the Lord was gracious.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.640]   He taught me that over time.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.920]   I think I wish I could have pushed the reset button
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.280]   a few times and thought,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.040]   you know, this is really what God's word says.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.120]   It's the will for me.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.880]   This is the truth.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.720]   And I need to follow the truth
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   instead of the truth that's in my head,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.920]   which is don't rejoice unless something great's happening.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.840]   You know, don't pray unless something traumatic is going on
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.760]   and deserves prayer.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.880]   And for heaven's sake, you can't be thankful for this,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.120]   you know, and when you can't explain, you know.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.400]   So that is not, and that's not the mom
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.440]   I wanted my children to be around.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.320]   - Right, that is so true.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.160]   - Yep, yep.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.280]   So I think that would have been,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.720]   I would have hit those three points.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.800]   It's not a long list.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.680]   - Isn't that funny?
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.160]   It's not a long list,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.840]   but it is an all-encompassing list
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.160]   because it covers everything.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.720]   It covers our worry about little Johnny's not getting this
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.400]   or little Susie is way too much of this.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.840]   I have failed here.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.440]   I have left this out.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.200]   I am running ahead.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   I just love it.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.360]   I feel like what you're saying that you wish you had known
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.160]   if you could start over,
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.520]   you would tell yourself to calm down
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.440]   and realize that God is in control.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.920]   We need to rest in the Lord, not stress so much
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.480]   because our anxiety is what either drives us to worry
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.240]   and constant work,
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   or our anxiety can drive us to prayer.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.640]   And that is actually the better way.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.480]   I love that.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.760]   I know, Amy.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   So often I look back and think,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.400]   wow, I would be a much better homeschool mom now.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.240]   - Oh yeah.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.440]   - But homeschooling is, I have become convinced
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.200]   homeschooling is a refining, not for our children.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.920]   It is a refining of us as parent leaders
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   and what our children get along the way is a bonus.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.120]   It's a benefit.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.560]   I do like that.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.280]   I love the first Thessalonians five references.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.120]   So you guys remember,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.640]   if you don't remember anything else,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.680]   remember that Amy has shown us a better way
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.400]   to rejoice, to pray, and to give thanks.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.080]   I want you to look back, Amy.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.600]   When your kids were little,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.200]   how did you start your homeschool day?
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.400]   - We were pretty routine,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.640]   boringly routine in our homeschool day
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.840]   because I have four children
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.480]   and they're about two to three years apart.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.120]   So there was someone always little or up at night
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.360]   or pregnant, whatever it was going on.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.200]   So what I felt like was really helpful for me
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.880]   is that we had to have a particular start time of the day
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.000]   and a particular ending time of the day
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.080]   because we needed to know we were finished.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.680]   - Yes, right.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.840]   - It didn't bleed into the evening.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.560]   We weren't getting up at nine
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.600]   and I'm behind the eight ball the whole day.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.880]   - Yes, yes.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.960]   - I felt like it was really helpful
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.560]   that we got up at a pretty reasonable time in the morning
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.000]   and we had some routine things that we did.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.600]   We had breakfast, we had chores,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   and then at 8.30, we have a little place in our home,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.840]   this little living room area.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.200]   That's where we would meet
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.960]   for our morning devotions
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.000]   and just our morning gathering.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.640]   We did that every morning
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.880]   and it was a great way mentally for us to go,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.320]   "Okay, 8.30 is coming."
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.440]   And if you had not had your breakfast,
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.600]   I was really, really sorry about that,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.760]   but we're going to get up early.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.240]   - I guess tomorrow we'll get up earlier.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.120]   - Yes, yes.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.840]   And if you didn't finish your chores,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.280]   which were not, unless you ask my children,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.960]   which they felt at that point enslaved.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.560]   - Yes, you're just enslaved.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.000]   You're enslaving your children.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.360]   - Yes, but it was mainly 10 minutes
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   of putting your bed together and picking up.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.600]   It was very simple.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.160]   But if you didn't get your chores done,
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.560]   you would just have an extra chore to do later.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.800]   But really what was the best part
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.600]   was having a routine every morning.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.200]   We are sitting.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.520]   We're in our little sitting places in the living room
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.360]   and everyone has their Bibles are in there
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.920]   and we just, we're ready.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.720]   We're ready for the day.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   So I did have, and that happened every morning
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.080]   that I was, yeah, pretty much every morning.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.640]   And then in the evening, we usually had time
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.120]   when my husband was home and we prayed together
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.240]   and we read together.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.880]   And that was just, it was just a rhythm.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.320]   It was like a big parenthesis.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.600]   Here's the beginning of the day.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.720]   Here's the ending of the day.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.600]   And that was, it was very helpful for me mentally
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.560]   to know, okay, I've got to be there too.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.680]   And just kind of jumpstarted the day.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.120]   And if I didn't feel ready, we started.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.160]   We started, yes.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.760]   So we did that every day.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.560]   - Now, I really think that young children
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.440]   thrive on a routine.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.880]   I think that they like the familiarity
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.600]   and the predictability.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.040]   I have, I started life as a kindergarten teacher
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.440]   and as a children's librarian.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.520]   And even when I was in high school and college,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.600]   I worked with little kids in Bible school
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.040]   and in summer programs.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.000]   And it really, it was clear to me
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.760]   from working with them so intimately
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   that they feel safe when they know what to expect.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.480]   And transitions, which are traditionally really difficult
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.920]   for small children, are easier to manage
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.480]   when they know what to expect.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.200]   And people act better when they're not surprised by things.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   And so I like, we liked routine of that nature too.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.160]   And the routine for little children,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.920]   it gets them to accept responsibility
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.320]   for their actions earlier.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.560]   You know, if everybody, if you can look around
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.560]   as a four-year-old and see
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   that your older siblings are doing their chores,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.720]   then you know what your chore is.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.000]   And so you begin to take responsibility for that
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.200]   and for finding your little Bible
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.960]   and for getting your lovey to sit with you
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.200]   on the couch for morning time.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   And you begin to understand how to take charge
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.760]   of the small pieces of your life that you can manage.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.080]   And I liked that.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   - So what about when your children,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.640]   or when some of your children got older,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.840]   did you still start the day together?
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.480]   - Oh yeah, we actually went through their high school years.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   Yeah, it was, we were always,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.720]   except for like CC day,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.960]   when we had to get out the door at 7.30.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.080]   We always started the morning at morning time.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   We didn't call it morning time.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.640]   We just said divination rules.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.120]   - Right, us too.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.920]   - So we would just gather and, you know,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.040]   15 minutes or 20 minutes.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.080]   And it was, I felt like, honestly,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.680]   the older years were more important in some ways
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.080]   because we were so scattered.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.520]   You know, people were doing their soccer team practice.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.080]   They had, some of my children had work.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.280]   Some of my children had, you know,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.800]   other activities that they kind of, you know,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.960]   or they needed the car or they needed this.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.600]   And so our morning time became really important
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.480]   because we would just gather around the word of God.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.280]   We'd read a passage.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.600]   And about that point,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600]   they were able to completely talk about things.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.360]   You know, they weren't like, you know,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.240]   hitting each other, blowing on each other.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   - Yes, yes.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.560]   Ways to encourage one another in teenage ways.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.040]   I mean, sometimes they, you know,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.440]   flumped in and they were tired and grumpy
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.160]   and, or didn't really want to be there.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.720]   Or maybe they had something on their mind
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.920]   that weren't really eager to share, which is fine.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.440]   But sometimes just being together and just praying
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.320]   and just having, I think sometimes as moms,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.400]   that we pray over our children blessings and thanksgiving.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.320]   I think it was really important for them to hear.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.080]   I was thankful for them.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.800]   You know, how much I love them, how much God loves them.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.040]   I think just repeating back some just truths
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.640]   about who God is and who they were.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.520]   And then just having a time,
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.240]   but sometimes we'd sing a hymn
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.080]   and then prayer and read scripture.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.200]   And then I would usually, for the older guys,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.480]   I would say, what's your goal for the day?
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.080]   What do you, what's kind of, what's on your plate?
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.480]   What have you got going on?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.160]   And how can I help you with that?
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.440]   And usually they'd have, is my soccer uniform clean?
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.880]   Or, you know, I need the keys to the car
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.840]   or someone says coming over for study hall
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.440]   or I'm stuck in math.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.200]   I don't know what to do.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.880]   So those kind of like a little business meeting
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.000]   at the end of that time just helped us
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.640]   kind of all reframe what we're going to do.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   And then everyone kind of set off to their work
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.880]   by that time because they're older
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.600]   and they could manage it.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.320]   And I would be just more of the support,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.360]   you know, helping them out.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.520]   So, yeah, it was, and we did that even in the evenings.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.920]   Whit read to the boys until they went off to college.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.320]   He was always, yeah, it's just, it's just,
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.480]   we just, we found, I think I found it lovely.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.280]   - Oh, I love what you said
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.920]   that it was the parentheses around your day.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.760]   You began together and you ended together.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.120]   It's like a beautiful bookend of the life journey
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.160]   that you lived out together in your home.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.080]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yes.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.920]   - So good.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.280]   I know that now, I mean, I have heard this a lot
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.760]   in the last few years.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.720]   You know, Amy, you said,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.120]   "Oh, we didn't call it morning time."
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.480]   I never heard of morning time 20 years ago
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.160]   when I started homeschooling.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.040]   My girls were, you know, 10 and seven 20 years ago.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.720]   So we didn't call it morning time.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.400]   I didn't know what morning time was.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.720]   I know that now I hear it all over.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.200]   A lot is made of morning time
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.920]   and sometimes morning basket time.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.520]   What is that?
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.080]   And do you have to use a basket?
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.800]   (both laughing)
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.560]   - Yeah, you know, Cindy Rollins wrote "Mere Motherhood,"
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.920]   you know, about that time, about 10 or 15.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.200]   And she's a lovely person.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.640]   She lives in Chattanooga here near us.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.800]   And just the most down-to-earth,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.240]   ordinary, lovely, lovely mom that you would ever meet.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   And she kind of coined, you know, the idea of morning time.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.640]   And I think the vision, it's changed over time,
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.160]   but I think it's just what we're talking about.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.360]   It's a time that you gathered with your family together.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.760]   First thing in the morning, usually.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.200]   In a routine way, it was regular every morning.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.080]   And you usually read something.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.520]   You had a devotional, like you read the scriptures
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.320]   and you prayed and you may have sang a hymn.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.600]   And then, so there's a reading part
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.160]   and it could even morph into reading something else,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.120]   but always the emphasis on putting the Lord
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.920]   at the center of the morning of the day.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.720]   And then there's usually some aspect of recitation,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.200]   either something memorized like a poem or a verse,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.600]   or like we worked on memorizing the doxology,
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.360]   the glory of the Lord's, you know, prayer,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.080]   Apostles' Creed, you know, those were things
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.600]   that we worked on memorizing verses.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.440]   We didn't usually recite poetry or anything
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.280]   during that time.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.200]   It was usually just our devotional time.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.640]   So it was usually just something that a devote,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.880]   some centering on the Lord,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.480]   something that your scripture reading and your prayer,
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.080]   and then it's routine.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.240]   And then there's usually an aspect
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.360]   of narration, speaking, repeating back
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.600]   what you just heard or memory work.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.200]   So it's very basic.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.440]   Now it takes all sorts of flavors and loveliness
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.360]   into the poems, but that's sort of the bare bones of it.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.520]   And I think it's, no, you don't have to have a basket.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.400]   - Sometimes people, I was just like,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.360]   no, what is this basket deal?
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.720]   And so we'll talk about in a minute
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.160]   what might be in your basket or on your shelf
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.360]   or, you know, somewhere that you pull out.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.720]   How long, you said that you guys took,
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.920]   what did you say, 20 or 30 minutes?
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.760]   Is that how basket morning time usually is?
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.480]   - It really varies.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.360]   I really love, I was looking at the Scribblers resource
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.880]   and there is a part in there about how you tell a story.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.200]   And one of the things is you're recognized
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.880]   when people are kind of done.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.720]   (laughing)
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.560]   - Yes, yes.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.200]   - You know, the time really varies
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.520]   because you have a variety of little guys.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.000]   If you have like, we had a three-year-old, five-year-old,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.400]   seven-year-old, nine-year-old, they're different.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.880]   And I have three sons,
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.280]   so they don't sit for long periods of time.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.160]   So we would do our devotional and finish
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.240]   in about 15 to 20 minutes.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.720]   Sometimes like we had drama on Wonderful Wednesday,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.200]   which is basically, we just got scarves
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.840]   and we tied them all over ourselves
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.400]   and added something.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.880]   And then we had, which was insane,
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   a music instrument day on Friday,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.120]   which I don't know why I did that
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.720]   because they argued over the same tiny little survey.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.120]   - Oh, 'cause everybody wants like the time block.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.800]   - Everybody wants.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.720]   So, but that was kind of,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.280]   that may have taken a little longer,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.520]   but I tried not to belabor.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.160]   And it just, you want to keep it really fresh
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.320]   and interesting.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.560]   So we did sing.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.480]   We always sang a hymn and a contemporary song.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   So we, by the time that was over,
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.800]   it's like 15, 20 minutes.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.960]   And then we would sort of,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.160]   we would take a break, like a little 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.040]   just so I could re-kind of-
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:09.880]   - Yes, reset.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.800]   - Re-open my mind and everyone was always hungry.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.840]   Again, I don't know how that happens.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.680]   - Yeah.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.040]   They become grazing animals at home, yeah.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.560]   - Oh yes, every two hours.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.360]   They never got out of that since infancy.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.480]   And so then we would get together
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.280]   and this time we'd just sit on the couch
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.160]   and lay on the pillows and the, you know,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.480]   big pillows and the kids would get their little light.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.520]   You said they're lovey.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.560]   I was our youngest, I would say they're a little lovey.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.160]   And then we would read together.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.080]   We would read.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.400]   We always had some, a chapter book we were reading
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.200]   or a piece of history that we were doing together or,
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.280]   and then that would be more what I would say,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.800]   the educational aspect where it would be like,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.960]   we're gonna look at this poem
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.440]   or we're gonna look at this story
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.720]   or we're gonna talk about this.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.800]   So that's when, again, that only was like 15 minutes.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.240]   That was not long periods of time.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.920]   It was just to get, whet your appetite.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.920]   That's the way I think of it.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.560]   Gather, whet your appetite, get ready for the day.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.400]   So that's kind of how we did it.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.440]   - That's good.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.280]   And where did y'all,
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.080]   you said you guys would be around the couch
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.280]   or in the family room on pillows.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.720]   - Or if we wanted to do something,
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.280]   sometimes we would do something with like drawing
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.560]   or something or folding.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   I had, you know, my sons never loved coloring.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.400]   (laughing)
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.120]   So I can't speak to that.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.080]   But if we did sit around the table,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.880]   we either did like Legos,
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.960]   like someone would be doing some cool Lego building
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.800]   and talking about that.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   Or if we were reading,
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.520]   sometimes giving them something to do.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.560]   Like something to fidget with or, you know,
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.480]   and at the table light,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.760]   they could be drawing if they wanted to.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.120]   I used, they had a bunch of tracing paper
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.840]   because again, my sons weren't big on drawing
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.440]   or that I had particular children that were devastated.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   It didn't turn out just exactly like it was.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.720]   - Yes, it was in their mind.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.520]   They couldn't make it like it was in their mind.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.640]   And so let's not do it.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.160]   - So we just did tracing so they could trace the picture.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.080]   So it varied, but normally that was a little more relaxed.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.160]   Like that was like, okay, let's just kind of gather.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.840]   We're all reading about China.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.000]   So let's talk about China.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.920]   Let's read a story about China.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.720]   And then we would move more into the kind of
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.600]   what I would say the formal part of the day
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.920]   where we're actually like, I'm working.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.080]   I'm usually working with each child
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.240]   or two children together.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.280]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.200]   It's like a slow entry.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.240]   So you add your devotion time
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.440]   and people are quiet and contemplative,
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.240]   but then you start maybe singing
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.800]   or doing narration of the story you read
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.040]   or some memory work.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.200]   And then it becomes, let's read a little bit together,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.080]   maybe a history or a biography
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.480]   and maybe you're doing something while you listen.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.280]   And then the pump is primed and we can do math
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.840]   or we can do our handwriting
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.440]   or we can work on our vocabulary words.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.800]   Yeah, that's really, that's really good.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.360]   I like that.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.600]   I want to encourage,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.480]   I can remember doing what I now know was morning time
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.840]   with my girls.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.680]   Sometimes we would take blankets
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.440]   in the good time of year.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.960]   It's not too hot, not too cold,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.280]   not too humid and not too buggy.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.920]   We would take quilts or blankets out
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.680]   under the trees in the yard and we would read
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.320]   and we sometimes we would close our eyes
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.800]   and we would listen.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.600]   It was just a sweet time of starting the day together.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   So it doesn't have to be regimented as to place.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.240]   I think that what you said is really important.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.000]   The habit of gathering together,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.360]   the routine of starting the day,
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.880]   all together doing these things
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.800]   gives you the freedom to do it wherever you want to.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.320]   That's really cool.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.040]   So let's go back
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.640]   because I suspect that lots of our listeners
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   are now captivated with this whole idea
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.240]   of the easy start to the day.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.480]   But what are some things that family,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.960]   I want to be real practical,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.520]   something people with very young children
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.920]   might try during this time
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.360]   and then the ancillary to that is
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.920]   how do you get your children interested
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.760]   in doing what you have chosen?
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.520]   Yeah, oh goodness, yes, yes.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.440]   That's always the issue.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.200]   Well, with very young children,
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.920]   we were much more brief, right?
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.400]   We did more like finger plays
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.520]   and hopping up and down and singing silly songs
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.120]   and being a lot more animated in that time
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.320]   or being cuddly and cozy.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.600]   You're really kind of reading the room, so to speak,
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.040]   with who people are.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.480]   And it's important that
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.960]   if someone's just feeling out of sorts,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.400]   we don't need to impose upon them,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.680]   like, well, you've got to be happy about this.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.320]   They can just sit quiet.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.760]   They were, they could be grumpy.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.200]   They just had to sit quietly
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.600]   and they couldn't hit their brother or sister.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.440]   Right, right.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.240]   That was part of the rule.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.480]   You had to be there.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.400]   But I think for as your youngers,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.640]   I do think it's nice,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.120]   like if you have flannel graphs or little puppets
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.800]   or something that engages them
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.720]   and the stories, the Bible stories,
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.560]   there's so many great Bible stories
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.120]   that are just in a storybook form
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.560]   that tell the real story and have illustrations,
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   but kind of are a gentle way of getting kids,
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.280]   children understanding the parts of the story,
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.920]   but not diving deep into the story.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.880]   So, and they can pray beautifully.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.600]   You know, our children would pray.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.720]   Like, could you pray for the person on your right?
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   Or could you pray, you know, or sing?
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.760]   So little kids, and then you, for your other time,
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.360]   like I think the reading time,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.200]   just a stack of, you know, good picture books
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.680]   or a variety of books that you have
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.480]   that you sort of gather
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.840]   and you could put it in a basket if you'd like,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.800]   or just put it in a stack beside, you know,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.680]   gather them together what you're reading together
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.360]   to keep the little ones occupied
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.760]   or do some hands on thing.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.240]   I love the, I love finger plays.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.920]   I think those are really sweet.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.320]   And I think it's really sweet to be like,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.240]   do a little circle time, you know,
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.840]   who's wearing a red shirt today.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.280]   If you can sing that song and everyone lights up like,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.760]   oh, I'm wearing a red shirt.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.440]   - So just doing some of the,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.200]   even those little we sing songs,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.480]   introducing little folk songs and little nursery rhymes.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.400]   Those are all the times that you do that.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.120]   That to me is like the sweet part of childhood.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.160]   You get to kind of embellish that a bit.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.000]   So yeah.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.160]   - Oh, that is so, that's really good.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.600]   And I like your emphasis on
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.000]   bringing concrete
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.600]   tools into the story time
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.840]   because children, with older kids,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.560]   you could talk about, sit and just read the story
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.640]   and just talk about what it means.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.000]   But little kids need to have something to touch and see.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   So they might need a puppet of that character
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   to envision that character in the beginning.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.720]   And then eventually they'll be able to fill in the details
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.600]   with their imagination and moving their body.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.320]   Actually with little kids helps them listen.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.880]   It doesn't deter their listening.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.960]   It helps their listening.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.800]   So I like those hands-on activities,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.680]   the things that they can do to involve all of their senses
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.920]   are really important for our little kids.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   The things that they hear and smell and see and do.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.960]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.160]   You can have, and you can incorporate.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   That's the things that you think, I don't have time for it.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.200]   Those are great things to incorporate in your morning time.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.560]   Like if you think, oh,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   we don't have time to play with Play-Doh during the day.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.480]   Well, grab some Play-Doh and just say,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.520]   let's sit at the table and what do you make?
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.720]   And they, I can't tell you the number of times,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.240]   they love the drama time.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.400]   I mean, literally I had to close doors.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.160]   - Oh my goodness, my girls too.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.320]   - It's just so funny.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.920]   They're like, can we act it out again?
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.560]   I'm like, okay, you know.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.080]   And they just love that movement and integration
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.720]   that they naturally do.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   It doesn't, it just comes with the package of having a,
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.640]   you know, five to eight year old, you know,
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.480]   they just know to do that.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.240]   So yeah, it's really fun.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.440]   Try to delight in it.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.920]   I think that's where I, it seems like,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.440]   oh, this is just play.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.920]   I've heard people say that,
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.240]   but no, that's the work of a child.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.800]   - Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.120]   Anything that engages all their senses
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.480]   is engaging their mind.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.360]   And here's the thing,
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.120]   the thing that you think is gonna be engaging to them
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.520]   might not at all.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.440]   I know my grandson who just turned two in June
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.360]   was over here this weekend and we were outside.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.200]   It was hot.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.520]   He always loves to be outside.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.920]   So I had taken the bullet and I was out in the heat
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.440]   and we were walking around and he was picking up this
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.520]   and picking up that.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.800]   And we were walking down the driveway
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.640]   and I said, buddy, it's so hot.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.280]   And he looked at me 'cause he was standing under a tree.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.680]   And he looked at me and I could tell he was thinking,
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.960]   Lolly, it's not hot.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.760]   And so I said, oh, Gideon, look at this.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.240]   And so I stood in the middle of the driveway
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.720]   and I held out my arms and I said, I am in the sun.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.600]   The sun is touching me and I'm hot.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.800]   And then I ran over to where he was and I said,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.840]   now I'm in the shade.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   The sun is not touching me and I am cooler.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.800]   And he looked at me, kind of funny.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.320]   And so I went on back out and walked and he said,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.880]   Lolly, talk about it again.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.720]   - Ah, I see.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.880]   - And I thought, okay, 'cause he looked.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.240]   And so, I mean, he asked for this.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.920]   So I did the same thing.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.320]   Now I'm in the sun, the sun is touching me.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.680]   So I went through it and he said, talk about sun again.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.440]   And then he said, talk about shade again,
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.160]   like three or four times.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.200]   And I thought, okay.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.080]   And so I had to go back in and tell my daughter,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.000]   okay, we've got a new concept now.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.120]   Sun and shade, 'cause I knew a lot of times
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.000]   she will call me after he's been with me and she'll say,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.520]   okay, did you talk about flap like a bird?
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.040]   'Cause I never said that to him.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.200]   And I don't know where this is coming from.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.640]   And so I will say, okay, now you might have to talk
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.360]   about windmills or you might have to talk about shade.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.840]   And so just realize that with your little children,
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.880]   the things that you see as a throwaway comment
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.320]   are the things that they are gonna grab a hold of
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.600]   and might become a thing.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.080]   So don't have, I think a tip for me from Morning Time
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.360]   is don't have such a structured plan
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   that you can't go off script happily at the drop of a hat
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.480]   because you never know where your child
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.640]   is going to learn something today.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.440]   - And that's, and really,
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.680]   if you need to put it in your schedule,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.200]   you can say, that's what this is about.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.240]   - Yes, chasing curiosity.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.160]   - Yes, check it off your list.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.240]   I explored, we prayed, and we checked.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.160]   If that makes you happy that you accomplished,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.440]   if that makes you feel like you've accomplished, then do it.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.600]   But I do think that having a time that's set aside
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.560]   that is sort of unstructured.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.600]   It is structured in that it's routine
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.680]   and we're always gonna pray
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.400]   and we're gonna study the scripture.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.480]   But if someone comes up with something
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.640]   that they're just so excited about,
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.360]   that's also a time that you celebrate with them.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.200]   Like, you know, can you show us like,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.120]   oh, look, you won a little jewel at Iwana.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.640]   Let's look at that, let's celebrate this.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.080]   Or someone's fascinated,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.000]   I had someone that was absolutely fascinated
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.840]   by Venus fly traps.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.880]   So we just took some time and chatted
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.960]   and like you said, explored it.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.680]   And you just showed Gideon both the idea of shade and sun.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.280]   Wow, that's a big concept.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.880]   And that's super neat that you got to do that
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.200]   and he watched you and that's what they'll typically do.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.120]   Do it again, say it again, do it again, do it again.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.360]   - I know, again, again, again, again.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.200]   - Yeah, it's nice.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.400]   - So what if I'm a young mom at home
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.120]   and I'm fascinated with this whole idea,
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.680]   but I've just started and my oldest child is just four.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.320]   And so I don't have a craft closet yet
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   and I don't have a lot of picture books yet.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.760]   Where do I get ideas?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.480]   Where do I get resources if I wanna try this
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.560]   but I don't know where to start?
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.400]   - Ooh, that's good.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.000]   Well, of course your local library has resources
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.520]   and I would say if you're NCC Connected,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.640]   they have tons of book lists in the Foundations channel.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.600]   They just do such lovely gatherings of good books,
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.880]   but you can find some good,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.840]   like what are some good Caldecott book awards,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.480]   especially the early ones.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.560]   And every library has those.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.320]   So I would just say, go to the library
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.680]   and just start gathering a variety of books
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.400]   and visit parts of the library that you never go to,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.480]   like maybe the picture section, geography section,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.160]   just grab a smattering and start there.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.800]   And then everyone has a Bible.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.120]   You probably have some hymns or songs
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.400]   that you sing at your church.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.920]   Well, then just start incorporating a few things
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.240]   here and there and get a feel
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   for how you wanna shape that morning time.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.160]   And then in the Scribbler's Guide,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.440]   as well as in the Copper Lodge series,
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.560]   the Ancient World Echoes,
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.000]   there are lists and lists of poems that are so fun to read.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.280]   Like if you are thinking,
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.960]   I don't know anything about poetry,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.680]   there are so many resources that CC has that you can read.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.280]   In fact, in the World Echoes and in Uncle Paul's,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.480]   which I love Uncle Paul's,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.800]   they're just little 20 minutes readings
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.000]   that usually none of your kids have done,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.480]   even if they're 18.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.200]   You know, they may not have read all the Aesop's Fables
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.400]   and those are cool.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.800]   You can act those out, you can narrate those back
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.120]   and they're funny.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.320]   - And they're short.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.080]   - Yeah, they're super short.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.000]   And they tell a good lesson.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.760]   If you have a particular lesson
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.160]   you want to be emphasizing in your family,
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.920]   you can find an Aesop's Fable.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.000]   You know, so, and that's just so,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.160]   those are just, let your imagination sort of go
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.440]   and try to keep it, remind yourself,
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.480]   it does not have to look perfect.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.160]   It is, and this is my little soapbox.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.640]   When you go on Instagram or you go on websites,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.280]   if you go Morning Time,
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.160]   normally you're gonna get a beautiful,
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.440]   a lovely picture of your family.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.520]   And they are usually completely dressed
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.880]   and sometimes matching beautiful clothes.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.000]   And they have their hairs all done.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.440]   - And they're washed and all the pets are groomed.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.480]   - Yes, there's always fresh flowers and candles
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.280]   and there's usually teacups.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.120]   And I just, I look at that and I think,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.520]   wow, we never, zero times in our,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.280]   and I was thinking the other night,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.320]   how many times did the day go right?
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.160]   Maybe five.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.800]   I did it 22 years. - Right, right.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.720]   - But maybe five times.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.960]   - And never when anybody else was looking.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   - Oh, never, never, never.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.760]   Yeah, I couldn't, you would have never guessed.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.640]   And I, you know, and that's the point.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.360]   We didn't have any kind of picture.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.840]   I never even thought to take a picture,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.640]   but because I was so hairy.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.000]   But I would just want to remind moms
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   that sometimes we have this idea of what our morning
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.080]   or our day or our homeschool should look like.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.920]   And it's almost like this dream that we think
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.600]   or what we've been shown.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.800]   This is the way it should be.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.640]   And I would just encourage families
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.720]   that is not the typical way it should be.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.680]   Your family is the gift from God and your family,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.640]   maybe they, you know, you wear pajamas to morning time.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.920]   Maybe you eat breakfast after.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.720]   Maybe you eat breakfast during.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.480]   You know, maybe it's sloppy.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.320]   Maybe people, normally in our morning time,
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.200]   I kept a spanking spoon in the cushion.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.040]   Because we had some kind of discipline issue,
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.240]   our character issue, believe it or not,
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.800]   that would come up during our time together.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.760]   It's at some point, not that I spanked people every day,
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.000]   that didn't happen.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.720]   But just the idea that we are in community.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.320]   That's what community is.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   And so when we are in community,
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.720]   if things don't go well, like you think,
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.400]   you have not failed.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   You have just tripped over the gift of community.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.120]   That's just what you, you've just discovered
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.160]   what community is all about.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.440]   So I just wanna encourage families
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   that when they're thinking about this,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.920]   it's not necessarily gonna match.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.680]   Now, I think it's wonderful if you can do that,
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.080]   but I want to also, that can become a discouragement
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.840]   or kind of this idea
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.440]   that this is the way it should be every day.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.160]   - Yeah, and you're not getting a benefit
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.120]   if it doesn't look like that.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.920]   That is absolutely not the truth.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.160]   That is not the truth.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.920]   I feel like we grew as a family,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.120]   probably more through the mistakes that we made together
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.760]   than we ever did in those picture perfect moments.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.600]   And we remember the hard lessons
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.320]   that the Lord taught each of us
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.040]   and as a family taught us through the hard things
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.560]   and the things we did wrong the first or second
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.760]   or third time before God refined it.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.520]   And so I also love the whole idea.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.960]   You mentioned scribblers,
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.400]   the scribblers resource a couple of times.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.360]   And one of the easiest ways for young families
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.640]   to design their homeschool journey
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.560]   is with those scribblers verbs.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.960]   And they can begin in that morning time together.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   If every day you pray together, play together,
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   read together, explore together and serve together,
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.880]   it has been a good day.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.920]   And you have done the work that God has set for you to do.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.840]   That's the easiest way to start,
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.600]   but it is the way of greatest impact
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.000]   for our little families.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.480]   And I love Amy, one thing that you have said to me before,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.760]   I really want our listeners to hear,
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   morning time does not begin in the morning.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.520]   When does the morning time begin?
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.720]   That's right, it begins the night before.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.920]   And let me explain why.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.080]   First of all, your children function best
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   when they have rest and sleep.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.360]   And even as you're closing out the day,
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.320]   checking in with them,
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.760]   that they're not worried or struggling.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.320]   Sometimes those quiet evenings
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.360]   are when you can settle people a bit
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   and you get a handle on where they are.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.720]   My sons all played soccer.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.040]   They were exhausted after games,
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.800]   so they needed to hydrate,
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.760]   they needed to shower,
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.840]   and they needed to get to bed.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.400]   And we did not have electronics in our home,
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.040]   anywhere but our living room kind of thing.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.720]   And so they rested.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.960]   So getting your children in a place
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.000]   where they can really sleep and rest,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.320]   they just need that.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.160]   And then for me,
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.840]   I remember a good story of when I was in junior high
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.800]   and I had to run this time,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.960]   like you had to run a quarter mile
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.000]   is the amount of time you have, whatever.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.520]   And I remember my coach was very empathetic
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   because I was just a skinny little short girl.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.960]   And he said, "Okay, look,
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.720]   don't look at the finish line.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.280]   Look past the finish line
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.800]   and run past the finish line
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   because you tend to slow down
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.120]   as you get to the finish line."
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.400]   - Oh, good.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.280]   - Yeah, wasn't that good?
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.160]   And so I passed, so yay.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.320]   But I think about in our day,
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.840]   like we come to the finish line at the end of our day.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.840]   The kids are in bed.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.680]   We're like, "Whew, it's been..."
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.120]   Take 15, run a little past that finish line.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.840]   15 minutes of just saying,
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   "Okay, where are the social study books?"
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.360]   And put out the cereal bowls
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.240]   or put a big cup with a teabag there for you.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.760]   Like, "Oh, I have my tea.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.000]   I'll be ready when I get up."
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.720]   Give yourself some time to prep for the next day.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.360]   Put things where you think they need to go.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.680]   If the homeschool room's in a little disarray,
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.960]   don't spend hours.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.800]   Just stack them back up.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.640]   Pick up some straight paper.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.360]   Make sure the pencils are out.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.640]   To me, the hardest days
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.240]   were when I was playing catch-up all day long.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.480]   Like, "Oh, I don't know where this is."
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.880]   - Absolutely.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.200]   - And so keep it simple.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.040]   Keep it simple.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.360]   You're not making gourmet meal the next day.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.920]   Just have things arranged where you can start.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.240]   And I always started my day,
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.080]   and I had to get sleep, too.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.640]   So I was staying up too late and that sort of thing.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.720]   And resting and then getting up.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.960]   I always tried to get up somewhat before they did
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.480]   because it was not fun
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.320]   when they were beside my bed going, "Mommy!"
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.160]   - Why? Why?
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.960]   - I feel like I'm behind the eight ball.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.320]   As soon as that happens,
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.560]   it's like all bets are off for the day.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.400]   - Yep, yep.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.880]   So, yeah, night before,
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.800]   just give yourself, I would say, 15 minutes.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.280]   Don't spend hours, of course.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.560]   Get ready for the day and get to bed
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.160]   and get the children in bed and settle.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.560]   They don't have to be sleeping.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.400]   Resting.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.240]   Just resting.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.160]   - But knowing that the day is done
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.720]   and we're just coming down.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.040]   We have crested the hill
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.800]   and we're almost at the bottom now.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.640]   - That's great.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.480]   That's great.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.080]   These are such beautiful ideas.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.440]   And I can already see and I feel our listeners
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.200]   seeing how all of this contributes
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.120]   to a great start to the day.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.200]   But I also want you to tell me
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.560]   how you feel that morning time
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   really helps families develop a family learning rhythm.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.920]   - Yes, I think that it develops a rhythm
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.320]   because it already establishes a rhythm.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.080]   Like we have something important that we're about to do.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.840]   We are preparing for that.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.920]   And we're sitting before the Lord
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.560]   and we're anticipating His work in our life.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.400]   And then we're gonna move through the day
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.120]   because that set start and that set ending,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.920]   that rhythm that we've established,
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.280]   you're not reinventing the wheel every day.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.840]   That you go from morning time,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.000]   we're gonna read together.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.320]   Now, what do you do next?
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.440]   Usually we did math in the morning.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.440]   And then if people had their own spelling or that,
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.320]   we had a rhythm to the day that grew
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.160]   as they took on their own educational responsibilities.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   When they started in the upper challenges,
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.800]   I did not have to follow them around.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   They had already had this idea of this is when I work
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.040]   and this is when I stopped working.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.960]   And this is what I do in these meantime.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.560]   This is how I order my day.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.680]   I structure what projects are more important,
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.320]   what's due, what do I have every day I do.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.840]   I think that as you've established that habit
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   of structuring the day and the ebb and flow,
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:20.640]   they have practiced that under your tutelage.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.840]   And then over time, they take it on themselves.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   And I see that provides, like you said, security and rest.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:34.000]   And they can also rest at the end of the day.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.840]   I am going to be content with what God
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.240]   has brought into my life today,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.040]   because I've worked heartily as unto Him,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.920]   and I've offered back to Him the fruit of my labor.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.240]   Sometimes it's two talents, sometimes it's maybe 10,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   but He doesn't say that matters.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.480]   He says, "Well done, well done, good and faithful."
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.320]   So I think helping them feel like the satisfaction
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.800]   of their work is part of what this offers too,
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.200]   because you can look at the day and go,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.440]   "Oh, look, I completed a day."
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.120]   And that doesn't mean I completed
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.720]   the assignments perfectly or I did it.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.280]   It just means that I walked through the day faithfully
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.840]   and I did good work.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.920]   There's a lot of satisfaction in that.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.320]   And that only builds more as they take it on themselves.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.080]   So I think it's a real gift that you can offer to your kids.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.880]   I actually think it's your gift to your children.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.400]   - This has been really good.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.640]   This helps, I think, us see that this morning time
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.880]   is a simple yet beautiful way to start the day.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.800]   And so morning time is just a simple little thing,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.960]   but morning time is also a bigger deal
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.600]   as we look at it as a time that sets the tone
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.680]   for our family's learning journey together.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   So morning time starts us off well,
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.200]   but it allows us to continue along our journey
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.440]   with contentment and satisfaction
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.240]   and a lot of how-to's manage ourselves as we get older.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.360]   So thank you, Amy, so much for this.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.800]   Listeners, I hope you have been as blessed as I have been.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.680]   And I hope that your fall starts off in a beautiful,
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.040]   calm, exciting, and enriching way.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.200]   And hey, I wanna mention this to you.

[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.080]   that you want to tell somebody else about,
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.800]   as an encouragement,
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.240]   we've got a way for you guys to share

[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.440]   that you would be willing to share
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.560]   as a blessing to another family.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.560]   This is called Honorable Mention, Celebrating Together.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.480]   And we're collecting your stories.

[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.920]   and we'll look forward to seeing you next time.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.160]   Thank you, Amy.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.480]   - Oh, thank you, Lisa.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.680]   It was fun.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.520]   - Bye guys.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.660]   you
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.720]   you
