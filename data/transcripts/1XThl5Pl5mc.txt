[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.900]   Now, I feel like I'm going to be preaching to the choir.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.540]   I was asked to talk a little bit related to what I did last year, but in the context of
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.700]   calling and vocation, specifically in the areas of science.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.500]   And I'm going to be, I know, preaching to the choir to most of you.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.540]   Most of you have this perspective, but hopefully there'll be, this will be an example that
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.240]   will help strengthen your sense of calling and where you fit into the fields that you
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.060]   work and maybe give you a little bit more equipping to help encourage others that you're
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.840]   working with.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.620]   What motivates this is this question, and I'm sure you get this kind of question too.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.540]   How can you reconcile living out your faith, your Christian faith, and work in the field
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.380]   of science or technology or engineering?
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.200]   And we all have experienced that.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.900]   And I knew that question going into my NASA career, coming to faith in the late 80s, largely
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.740]   through the ministry of grace to you, like probably also as a shared experience with
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.980]   many of you.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.420]   I knew going into the NASA opportunity in 1996 that I would face that question, working
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.680]   in the area of science and being in faith.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.660]   How can you reconcile the two because of this perception of conflict, right?
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.340]   And that perception is still very strong.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.380]   Another talk I could give would address why that conflict exists, and I did a little bit
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.300]   of that last year, I think, but I won't have time today.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.440]   But we all have experienced that question.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.340]   Now we get things like this, right?
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.660]   Which this comes in an example from the Webb Space Telescope.
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.260]   So a recent reach into the deep space, and we get questions about that, and of course
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.980]   we hear the billions of years of age and all of that, and we got the question of light,
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.180]   you know, the traveling of light, but at the same time we see these things and people are
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.540]   invoked in awe and wonder, right?
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.020]   That's the response.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.980]   And the farther we look, historically, the more we see.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.980]   So it's a great platform to engage with the gospel.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.660]   And I think the better question is this, what should inform our worldview regarding scientific
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.500]   endeavor in our work in science?
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.280]   And that's what I really want to address here, and again, I might be preaching to the choir,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.180]   but hopefully this will help reinforce what many of you already know.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.660]   Another example from the Webb Space Telescope, just incredible beauty.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.580]   The farther we look in distance, the more beauty we see.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.260]   And actually you can go the other way, right?
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.980]   With a microscope, the farther we look in that direction, the more beauty, the more
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.620]   awe and wonder that's invoked, the more ordering, and I'm going to talk a little bit about that
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.500]   in a bit, that we see.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.740]   It's without end, and it gives us a glimpse of the concept of affinity.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.380]   So just establishing the biblical worldview of our calling, I want to review some of the
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.620]   basic teachings of scripture that we need to consider.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.720]   In the beginning, God created the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkness
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.060]   covered everything, right?
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.340]   That's the beginning of the creation account.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.940]   Let there be light, and there was light.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.940]   And I suggest that light is not just the visible light, that narrow spectrum that we see visibly,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.340]   but it's all of energy.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.180]   It's what energized God's creation.
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.680]   That's important for us to remember.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.300]   This is a key part of the creation account.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:06.660]   And then this, God proceeded over six days to take what was void or empty, and he filled
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.020]   it in what was without form in space, time, structure, and place.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.220]   And I use those words specifically.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.420]   He ordered the filling.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:29.340]   And I'm going to focus, perhaps, on the ordering of the filling of God's creation, and how
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.540]   it relates to our call and our work in science and technology and engineering.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.940]   Another example, and I'm going to come closer to earth here shortly, but I wanted to start
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:49.380]   out with the newest images from the web.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.900]   Another aspect, though, that I want to focus on is the subjective aspect.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.140]   Who are we?
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.540]   Let us make man in our image after our likeness, again from Genesis 1.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.900]   There's so much foundational in Genesis 1.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.060]   We need to go back there all the time to strengthen the foundation of our understanding.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.780]   So he made him in the likeness of God, male and female.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.780]   He created them.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.500]   We have to remind everybody of that nowadays.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.860]   And he blessed them and named them man when they were created.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.500]   And he said, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.100]   over every living thing that moves on the earth."
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.520]   And I highlighted the fruitfulness.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.740]   We are to be fruitful in our endeavors, in our labors.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.900]   We are to subdue the ordered creation that God gave to us and have dominion over it.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.660]   Key to our understanding, key to our worldview as we work in our areas of science.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.180]   You've given him dominion over the work of his hands from Psalm 8.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.860]   Now let's come a little closer to earth here.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.900]   And here we have a wonderful picture of, and just to orient you, we've got the island of
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.060]   Cuba in the foreground here.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.900]   We've got the Southeast U.S. so you see the peninsula of Florida.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.520]   You can see the Florida Keys sweeping out there.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.620]   And you can see the Bahamas and the beautiful, beautiful coral reefs.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.860]   Just to put that, when you look at that, what comes to mind from the scripture, from a biblical
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.860]   worldview?
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.500]   Well, pulling from the oldest book in the Bible, Job, he stretches off the north over
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.200]   the void and hangs the earth on nothing.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.180]   And as Monica said, there are no strings attached.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.900]   He hangs the earth on nothing.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.140]   And when you read that chapter, chapter 26, it's speaking of the majesty of God, but it's
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.700]   speaking from the perspective of being off the planet.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.060]   So it gives you a glimpse of how profound it was to me to have the opportunity to be
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.100]   off the planet and reflect on the truth of scripture with that perspective of viewing
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.100]   the planet.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.300]   Another one of my favorite pictures that brings scripture to mind.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.940]   This is what we call the Terminator, which is the line separating the night side of the
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.100]   earth from the dark side of the earth.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.140]   A very difficult thing to photograph because of the difference in the lighting condition
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.820]   and the aperture of the camera.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.020]   But this is one of my favorite pictures trying to capture what we call the Terminator.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.580]   In that same chapter of Job, he has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.740]   boundary between light and darkness, perfectly describing from the vantage point of being
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:40.660]   off the planet of what we see off the planet, written in the oldest book of the Bible, which
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.580]   gives testimony to the inspiration of the Bible.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.420]   And I leave all of Job 26 as a homework assignment to you, and I'm going to give you a couple
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.420]   homework assignments in this talk.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.140]   It is a profound chapter, and I just pulled out a couple of them, but it ends this way.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.660]   Behold, this is but a glimpse.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.300]   This is but a whisper of who he is, the thunder of his power.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.300]   Who can understand?
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.620]   And we know if we're familiar with the book of Job, it is a very humbling chapter as we
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:17.740]   consider our place before God in the witness of Job and also his friends.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.700]   One of my favorite passages of scripture is Psalm 111.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.780]   And if you have a Bible, I would encourage you to turn there.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:34.940]   Psalm 111, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I will point out a few aspects
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.300]   of the psalm, and then we'll get to verse 2 there.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.100]   First it's a psalm of a believer.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.140]   In verse 1, he says, "I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart in the company
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.780]   of the upright in the congregation."
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.420]   So it's a believer among believers.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.100]   It's a worshipful song.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:04.220]   It's acknowledging the works of Yahweh, the work of his hands.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.420]   And in the psalm, he rehearses the works of God in different ways.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.380]   He rehearses his works of creation.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.980]   He rehearses his works of provision.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.100]   He talks about food.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.980]   He talks about the goodness of his works.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.320]   He talks about the wondrous works that are remembered.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.180]   He talks about the graciousness and the mercy of God in his works.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:37.580]   All of that is through the understanding and through the lens provided in his work of redemption,
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.380]   which he acknowledges in verse 9.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.660]   He sent redemption to his people.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.460]   He has commanded his covenant forever.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:51.580]   That reminds me that in our worldview, as we approach the issues of science and technology
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.500]   and engineering, we can only understand it through the lens of Scripture, through his
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.140]   work of redemption.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.700]   So we can only comprehend his works of, for example, his creation, his works of ordering
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.500]   his creation or the provision that we find in the order, his works of sustaining his
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:16.940]   creation, his works of providence in life that Jennifer gave witness to, trusting in
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.940]   that.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.820]   We can only comprehend and understand that through his work of redemption, which gives
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:29.420]   us the new heart, grants us wisdom, grants us understanding, grants us knowledge and
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.980]   all of that by grace.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.700]   And that's another aspect that we have to remember as we give witness to those around
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:42.860]   us, as we work in our different fields, and it motivates us to not only give witness but
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.860]   to extend grace to those who are blind to these things, right?
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:53.780]   So we can't convince, we can't persuade a non-believer to have this biblical worldview.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:01.180]   All we can do is give witness to it, and it is God that will work in the heart as he chooses.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.300]   The psalm ends, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.020]   All those who practice it have a good understanding."
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:17.740]   But back in verse 2, verse 2 is a profound verse when we have that biblical worldview.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:25.620]   This psalm was known as the scientist's psalm at one point in the 1800s.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.500]   And I'll talk a little bit about that in a few minutes, a little bit more.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.900]   But this was the verse that was central in the whole psalm that made it the scientist's
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.900]   psalm.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:40.940]   "Great are the works of the Lord, studied by all who delight in them."
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.140]   When we first read this, we might be tempted to think, okay, it is a psalm to command us
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:54.000]   to delight in God's works, or it is a psalm that commands us to study his works.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.880]   But if you look at the grammar, it's not a command at all.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.380]   It's a description, right?
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.300]   The works of God are studied works, that describes the works.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:11.580]   They are studied works, and the believers are delighting believers.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:18.460]   So with a proper worldview in our approach, we delight in our work as we study the works
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.460]   of God.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.060]   It is a characteristic of us as believers.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:30.660]   So those works declared great are studied works by delighting believers.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:39.820]   And that includes his works of creation, provision, providence, and redemption, all understood,
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.780]   as I said, through his work of redemption.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.020]   And as I said, that psalm became known as the scientist's psalm.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.180]   I'm not going to go into why the conflict exists, but I will remind us of the root of
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.180]   the conflict.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.540]   And it's right there also in Genesis, in chapter 3, "Did God actually say?"
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:05.380]   And that's the root of all of the conflict that we experience, or we observe, or we get
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.020]   questioned about, "Did God actually say?"
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.660]   It's a rebellion against God.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.440]   And just one passage, also out of scripture, "In those days, there were no king in Israel.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.200]   Every man did what was right in his own eyes," which is the closing verse in the Book of
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   Judges.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.880]   And it reflects our experience today.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:32.400]   You know, we're all around us, we'll do what is right only in their own eyes.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.840]   By the way, that picture, any recognize that picture?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:43.080]   Yeah, Dead Sea, Jordan River Valley, Sea of Galilee.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.000]   There's a moonset.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.040]   I'm going to spend a little bit more time here in the scriptures.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.080]   In Job 28, in the middle of the chapter, it says, "But where shall wisdom be found?
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.720]   Where is the place of understanding?"
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.000]   And I also give you Job 28 as homework.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.480]   This is the pivotal verse in that chapter.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.000]   In the first part of the chapter, it talks about two things, which are reflected in the
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.920]   verses that I rehearsed from Genesis 1.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.200]   It talks about God's provision in the ordering of His creation.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.640]   And it puts it in the context of mining operations.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:29.480]   And if you go read Job 28, it talks about there's a mine for silver, a mine for gold,
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.640]   ore is taken out of the mountain, food grows from the ground.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.040]   So it's speaking of God's provision found in His creative work.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:45.360]   And it also says that man, mankind, does that.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.000]   He goes to find it.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.760]   He searches it out.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.920]   He drills a hole in the mountain.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.080]   And it acknowledges that no bird of prey can do it, doesn't even think about it.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.480]   The lion doesn't do it, the king of the beast, but it's unique to man.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.240]   So it acknowledges two things.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.880]   One is the rich provision of God's creative work.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.960]   And then it acknowledges man's ability to go search it out, to find it, to consider,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.560]   okay, what can I use this for, to develop it?
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:26.040]   So that gives the basis of the worldview of science, technology, engineering, industry,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:33.480]   is that God-given ability of mankind to extract what He has provisioned, especially so in
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.520]   His creative work.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.240]   But then we have this key verse, "But where shall wisdom be found, and where is the place
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.240]   of understanding?"
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.760]   And it goes through, we've heard a rumor of it, we know it's out there, wisdom, but we
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.080]   can't attain it.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   So it's one of those things, although we have such great capability to achieve things, to
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:01.640]   achieve technological achievements and other things, we have this great inherent capability
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.160]   given to all to go extract the provision.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.240]   There's one thing that's out of our reach, one thing that we cannot attain, one thing
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.160]   that we cannot achieve on our own, and that is the attainment of true wisdom.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.960]   And I know we could go through discussions of wisdom, human wisdom and godly wisdom and
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   whatnot.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   This is true wisdom.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.760]   This is wisdom revealed by God Himself, and that by grace.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.920]   So it has to be revealed to us.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.400]   And the chapter ends this way, "Behold the fear of the Lord."
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.320]   That is wisdom, "and to turn away from evil is understanding.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.800]   It is by grace that we're granted true wisdom that informs our understanding of God's works
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   of creation, provisioning His creation and His works of providence, as we've talked about.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:58.360]   So it's kind of key, it's fundamental to understanding the worldview in which we live out our vocations.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.920]   And then this theme of wisdom, if you follow that and you go to Proverbs 8, "Whoever finds
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.600]   wisdom finds life."
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   And what is it?
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.960]   What do we think about there?
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.560]   Well, the manifestation of wisdom is found in Christ, right?
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.720]   So if we take the life theme there, we go to John 1, "All things were made through Jesus
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   Christ."
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.440]   He is the creator of all things, "and without Him was not anything made that was made.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.040]   In Him was life."
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:35.000]   And again, I'm just giving you the thread through Scripture that becomes the foundation
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.880]   for a fuller understanding of our calling in our vocation.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.080]   I could go to 1 Corinthians 1, I don't have it on the slide, but that's where it talks
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.120]   about godly wisdom and human wisdom and the paradox there, apart from the grace of God,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.680]   which grants us that understanding of Christ and the understanding of wisdom, as Paul writes
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.960]   in Colossians, in Christ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.560]   That's the thread of Scripture.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.440]   That's the logic of Scripture that can provide our foundation for entering our vocations
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.680]   and working in our vocation.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:21.640]   Now, when I get put on a slate to speak, everybody thinks they need to hear about space.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.000]   So I'll give you a little bit of space.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.680]   Anybody here see a space shuttle launch?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.400]   Okay, a couple of you.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.160]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.360]   The space shuttle on the launch pad weighed 4 million pounds.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:48.240]   Most of that weight was the fuel and the oxygen, and it produced 7.5 million pounds of liftoff.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.600]   And it lifted off at the very precise time to later rendezvous with the International
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:00.120]   Space Station, which was my experience and what I was dedicated to my entire career.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:06.440]   And you fired the rockets, not only at a certain point, but in a certain direction, a certain
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:14.480]   profile on ascent, fire the engine for a specific time, 8 minutes and 53 seconds, after which
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:22.080]   you were out of the atmosphere and accelerating to a speed of 17,500 miles an hour, which
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.480]   put you in orbit on a trajectory to later rendezvous about 46 hours and a few minutes
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.120]   later with the International Space Station.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.600]   All of those things were very precise, very predictable.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.960]   We know that, actually we had a launch attempt this morning that got aborted, I don't know
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   why, but it was going to the space station, they had a problem, I think that for some
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.000]   reason they scrubbed the launch, but it was a very precise time.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.440]   So I confess, I was actually back there during your talk with my little, on my iPhone, keeping
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.840]   track of the launch.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.880]   But when it aborted, I got tuned back into your talk.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:12.160]   But all of that is a demonstration of God's ordering of his creative work and mankind's
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.840]   ability to extract that order.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:28.920]   And of course, if those of you that experienced this, it was a very powerful thing to witness.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.840]   Not only do we know the time and the direction and the duration and all of that to get the
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:40.360]  re, but think about all the work, all the detailed work it took to put it together and
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:47.600]   to build it and to get to a level of reliability where we had the confidence to actually light
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.640]   the torch on fire.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.120]   And of course, we've done it not without failure historically.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.480]   So we are limited in our ability to do it, but yet we do it.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.280]   The provision is there, and we have the ability to extract that provision.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.360]   And this is the vantage point it brings you.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.680]   I want to read you a couple of quotes, and I think I might have used this quote last
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.280]   year for those of you who were here, but I didn't have the words on the screen.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.760]   From the rocket, we shall see the huge sphere of the planet Earth, like phases of the moon.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.080]   We shall see how the sphere rotates, and how within a few hours it shows all its sides
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.520]   successively.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.600]   And we shall observe various points on the surface of the Earth for several minutes and
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.660]   from different sides very closely.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.380]   This picture is so majestic, attractive, and infinitely varied that I wish with all my
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.500]   soul that you and I could see it.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:50.960]   This was written in 1911 by a gentleman who is known as the father of the Soviet space
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.640]   program, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.080]   1911.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   How is that possible?
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.600]   Well, it's possible.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600]   He was a physicist.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.880]   He was a theorist.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:10.320]   So he, studying the ordered creation around him, he came up with this concept that today
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.840]   we take for granted, which gives a testimony to two things, the provision in God's creative
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.760]   work and mankind's ability.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.880]   Here's a little bit later another quote, using material ferried up by rockets, it would be
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.960]   possible to construct a space station in orbit.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.120]   The station could be provided with living quarters, laboratories, and everything needed
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:38.800]   for the comfort of its crew who would be relieved and provisioned by a regular rocket service.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.440]   Exactly describing my experience on the International Space Station over four flights, building the
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.680]   thing piece by piece, along with many others of course, in that international partnership
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.200]   and every few weeks having a supply ship show up that we'd have to unload and we would have
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.880]   everything that we would need.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:02.920]   That was written by a more familiar name to you, in 1945, who was an author of much science
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   fiction.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.400]   Again, building on the concepts that theoretically were possible, that we're seeing because of
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:17.320]   the observable mathematical ordering of God's creative work, gives testimony to the provision
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.520]   and testimony to God-given ability of those who bear his image.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.000]   And of course, this is the result and I could give another whole talk on this.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.160]   It's an amazing achievement.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:37.300]   I think hopefully it remains a humbling achievement and not one like the Tower of Babel, but resulted
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:43.240]   in the International Space Station, which still flies and the rocket that was going
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.080]   to launch this morning was destined to, and will be destined when they get off the pad,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.600]   to the International Space Station, which has had continual human presence in orbit
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.960]   since the fall of 2000, so 23 and a half years.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:02.000]   And just to give you a little bit of scale, this is bigger than a football field, if you
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.200]   include the solar arrays out there.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   It orbits the Earth every 90 minutes.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.840]   It's got a pressurized volume inside the equivalent of a 5,000 square foot house and currently
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.880]   we're operating with a crew of seven.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.840]   And it's got so many elements in it.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.240]   Now imagine, we have to duplicate what God has provided here on Earth that is essentially
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.200]   our life support system.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:35.960]   The atmosphere, the water cycle, everything that the creation provides for us to sustain
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   our life.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.040]   We have to duplicate it up there artificially, but yet we have the ability to do that.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:48.440]   History has shown that, to duplicate God's design in his creative work and have continual
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.040]   human presence for 23 and a half years.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.960]   Here's our view out the window during the daytime and our view out the window at night.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.720]   Just incredibly beautiful and an amazing place to go and appreciate the details of God's
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.600]   work in a very unique way.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.040]   Occasionally we get the opportunity to go outside.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.680]   I call it the ultimate skydive.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.920]   And I had the opportunity to do five of them and when you're outside on a spacewalk, you're
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.040]   outside for six and a half or seven hours.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.200]   So and it takes about six hours just to prepare to go out the door.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.600]   But again, duplicated inside that spacesuit is everything needed to sustain your life.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.960]   The oxygen debris, the carbon dioxide removal, the humidity removal, maintaining a temperature
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.120]   that is somewhat comfortable, but not endangering anyway.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:52.080]   Again, given testimony to the provision of God's creative work and mankind's ability.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.720]   Some spectacular things you see from that vantage point.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.880]   There's a sunset, just the edge of the sun disappearing over the horizon and you see
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.280]   the clouds that provide the shadows in front of the cloud.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:12.200]   Or in terms of scientific discovery and whatnot, these are called noctilucent clouds where
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:18.320]   we would see occasionally over the north polar region during our summertime or the southern
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.480]   polar region during our wintertime.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.760]   We're on the night side of the earth looking up over the north polar region here where
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.360]   the atmosphere is backlit from the sun, which is on the other side of the earth, showing
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   these very incredible, very curious formation of something.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   And the theory is there are ice crystals carried up very high in the atmosphere above the normal
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360]   weather systems.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.280]   And of course, I would agree with the theory.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.280]   That's probably a good theory.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:54.640]   There are ice crystals carried up there, different layers of the atmosphere and mixed up by the
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.400]   different air currents, the jet streams and whatnot.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.800]   But notice the repeating pattern.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.680]   Notice the order, the mathematical order which this crowd appreciates.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   It's evident there, it's evident everywhere.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.320]   Or the beauty and the design and what is pleasing to the eye.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.540]   Here's an example of coral reefs.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.400]   These are the Bahama reefs that were part of that picture earlier.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.640]   Or a close-up of the largest reef in the Bahamas.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.840]   Here's some examples of what we can observe and the beauty.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.160]   And notice two things.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.360]   One is the objective observation of what we see.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:43.520]   But also our subjective response to that observation reflecting the image that we bear.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.960]   In a bleak view of the Grand Canyon right after a snowstorm.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.480]   A glacier in Pakistan.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.360]   It all draws our attention, right?
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.040]   Draws our curiosity.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.400]   Sand dunes in the Sahara Desert.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:05.080]   Sand dunes became one of my favorite subjects, if you will, to collect some pictures.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.260]   Notice the mathematical ordering of these dunes, right?
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.840]   And we know that from, most of us from our work, we see mathematical ordering in everything.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.200]   We know how, if you have a math background, you know how to mathematically describe some
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.320]   phenomena that we see in nature.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.920]   One of my favorite pictures to that effect is this one.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.120]   These are also sand dunes in a different part of the Sahara Desert.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   But look at this.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   It's incredible.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   You see the orthogonal lines, the repeating patterns in both large-scale and small-scale.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.100]   My favorite picture to show and to give an illustration to the mathematical ordering
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.840]   of God's creation.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.240]   And some of the areas that you all work, by the way, cosmos.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   What does it mean?
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.600]   It's order, right?
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.200]   As opposed to chaos.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.720]   God's creative work is not chaos.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.840]   He had ordered it and he filled it.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.200]   And how did he order it?
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.560]   When we look, we see not only the order, we see the precision in that order.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.440]   I'll come back to that theme in a minute.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:18.880]   We see beauty, elegance, simplicity, complexity, variety, harmony, symmetry.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.480]   I would ask unity or add unity to that list, right?
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.920]   Unity and the complexity and the diversity.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:34.680]   Some examples in our work, mathematics, trigonometry, geometry, calculus.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.240]   Calculus, it took, I went through it three times.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.200]   I went through it undergraduate, went through it in graduate, and I went through it again
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   in experimental test pilot school.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.680]   The third time, I think I was finally getting it, right?
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:55.080]   But calculus just always amazed me how it could describe the phenomena that we observe
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   in so many different ways, from basic calculus all the way to partial differential equations
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:06.400]   and all of that, everything in between, describing so much of what we see.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:13.560]   And we know that we can describe, we can model things so much with math, in physics, in chemistry.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:20.800]   The periodic table is an obvious example that I give to many.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.400]   It's amazing that the elements that have been discovered, and maybe there will be others
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   discovered in the future, can be described with whole numbers in the order that is reflected
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.200]   in the periodic table.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.760]   Or I talk about optics a lot as well, very predictable.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.160]   We go to the optometrist, we find that we need a correction in our vision.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.600]   He can measure very precisely through the instruments what our correction is needed
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   and then he prescribes a lens and we put them on and, whoa, the world is clear again, right?
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.560]   And all the other things we do with optics, from telescopes to microscopes and everything
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:05.160]   in between, is a demonstration of the ordering of God's creative work.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:11.680]   Or in biology, DNA and all of the things that have been learned in DNA and the incredible
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:22.120]   complexity, but the precision in the complexity of DNA as a basic information for life.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.320]   Or the cellular function.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.680]   And we know from the history of, if you go back and trace the history of philosophies of,
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.040]   related to evolution, which goes all the way back at least to Greek mythology,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.320]   you know, the cell was assumed to be simple, right, and then it evolved.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.920]   But we know that the cell is an incredibly complex, incredibly ordered.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.360]   It's a, it's a, it's a machine with incredible complexity to it.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.920]   Or an organism in itself, the human body, any kind of organism that if you take out one
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.880]   part of the organism, the organism can cease to exist, right?
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:08.000]   The irreducible complexity, as you heard that term, all of that is a demonstration
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.240]   of God's ordering.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.640]   Or for those, I'm speaking to a scientific-related crowd here, but oftentimes I speak to folks
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.440]   that don't like science, don't like math.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.920]   I say, well, maybe you like music, and music is another demonstration, and I always pick
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.440]   on the guitar player, because I'll say, I'll say, I'll take that guitar, and I'll take
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.240]   that string, and we'll measure the tension on it, and we'll pluck it, and you tell me
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.400]   what note it, it plays, and then I'm going to take your string, and I'm going to cut
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.280]   it in half, and pull it to the same tension, and I'm going to pluck it again, what note
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   is it going to play?
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.240]   It's going to play the same note, right, an octave higher.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:53.140]   So I use that as an illustration, just to show musicians that don't like science, the,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.720]   the ordering God's creative work.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:04.520]   Here's an oblique view of the sun reflecting in the ocean, and different layers of, of
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.040]   clouds and weather.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.280]   There's a lawfulness of nature that we're very familiar with, and it's intelligible,
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.560]   it's discoverable, it's immutable, it doesn't change.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.320]   And there's a stunning provision in that lawful created order, and oftentimes I focus on this
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.400]   because when we think of provision, we think of the, the raw materials that we extract
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.920]   from the ground.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.800]   But the provision goes so much deeper than that, so much broader than that, in the, for
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.880]   example, the mathematical ordering that I touched on.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.320]   God has granted our, an amazing ability to observe, contemplate, search, explore, discover,
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.020]   evaluate, develop, and utilize that provision.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.020]   Those two things.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.680]   He exists, and he's given us the, this ability, and this is common to everybody.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:59.340]   This is foundational to a biblical worldview of the work that many of us are in, and it
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:08.480]   also is foundational to us understanding and engaging in that work as a calling, as a vocation.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:16.700]   We are called into that with these basic elements of our worldview.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:26.160]   New York City, which is a great illustration of the history of humanity and the growth
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:32.400]   of technology and extracting from God's provision, even apart from his work of redemption in
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   the hearts.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.140]   It's a, it's a common ability given to all mankind.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:43.080]   There's a Puritan by the name of Stephen Charnock, perhaps you've heard the name.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.520]   I found this quote when he was talking about the provision of God's creative work in great
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:55.480]   detail in that big volume, The Existence and Attributes of God.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.240]   All things in the world, he says, one way or another, center in the usefulness for man.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.520]   Some to feed him, some to clothe him, some to delight him, some to instruct him, some
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:12.740]   to exercise his wit, is what it said originally, or you could say his intelligence, and others
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.080]   his strength.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:21.400]   So true in the work that we do as we go explore God's creative work, discover things, extract
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.040]   it, develop it, apply it, utilize it.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   It's the perspective that Charnock had, that he drew from the scripture.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   Science as we know means knowledge.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.960]   It comes from the Latin.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.360]   A classically understood scientific endeavor, and I'll get to the classical part where I'm
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:48.080]   drawn from in history, the searching out of knowledge to understand God's works, to discover
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.840]   and utilize the provision found in creation, and to develop that discovered science into
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.320]   technology for our good and for God's glory, right?
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:05.080]   And that motivates us in our calling, in our engagement in this work.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.360]   Scientific endeavor is a category of subduing God's ordered creation, going back to Genesis
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:18.080]   1 in those verses that I reviewed at the beginning, and exercising dominion over it, and it contributes
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.840]   to be fruitful.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.280]   Sometimes we say be fruitful and multiply, and we apply the fruitfulness to multiply
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.800]   and to reproduction, but it's broader than that.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:33.060]   It includes that, but it also includes these other endeavors.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:40.200]   Fruitfulness in life and scientific endeavor certainly is a component of that.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:49.240]   Psalm 111, verse 2, delighting in the studied works of God, and we are called to that work.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:55.760]   So all of this is what is to inform our calling, our vocation in the areas of math and science
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.240]   and related.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.080]   Here's some examples from what I call the age of science.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.880]   Sometimes this is called the scientific revolution.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.160]   I prefer to call it the age of science.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.560]   I might get to it why that is in a minute.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.320]   If I don't get to it, remind me if we have time for Q&A, I'll come back to that.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.280]   But we all know these names, we all review these names, learn these names in undergraduate
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   levels of math and science courses, engineering courses, Kepler in astronomy, Boyle in chemistry,
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.600]   Boyle's law, you learn that if you're a scuba diver or do anything related to scuba diving.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.560]   Newton, of course, very familiar.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:45.640]   Euler, if you study math, Euler's equations, Faraday in electromagnetics, Pasteur, we all
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:50.020]   benefit from Pasteur's work with the milk in our refrigerator, right?
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.160]   That's why we call it, it's pasteurized, in his work in biology.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:00.560]   Maxwell, one of my favorites in thermodynamics and electromagnetics, and Calvin, of course,
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   in thermodynamics.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.600]   All of these and many more were theologians first.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.560]   And they were driven in their science, answering the call that God had given them by their
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.960]   theology.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.840]   And that should characterize us, right?
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.960]   If we don't understand biblically why we work and what we work in, then we need to endeavor
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   to do that.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   We need to endeavor and grow in our understanding of the biblical foundations in which calls
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.400]   us to our work, our vocation, like these guys.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.820]   You don't read about their faith in any of the textbooks, right?
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.820]   But it's true.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.520]   If you go, and nowadays with the internet, there's more research, more opportunity out
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.360]   there to access information.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.160]   But you'll find that these guys, maybe we don't agree with all their theology, all the
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:02.400]   specifics of their theology, but they were theologians first, driven by their understanding
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:09.840]   of what God had revealed and their understanding of their calling in their work of science.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:17.280]   They lived by basic presuppositions in science, and those presuppositions included what we've
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.320]   been talking about.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.360]   There is a rational and knowable ordering in creation.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.040]   It didn't arrange itself by chance, right?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.100]   We know that.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.100]   Everything is ordered.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.860]   And I gave some examples in the different disciplines that we work in that demonstrate
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   that order.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.320]   And furthermore, there's a precision in that ordering.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:42.760]   That's why we can launch a space shuttle at the exact second and fire the engine for a
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.040]   duration exactly, precisely, to get to an orbit.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.680]   That's very precise.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.160]   That will then, in the trajectory, rendezvous and enable us to dock with an international
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:59.000]   space station going at that same precise, predictable speed at a place that's predictable
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.600]   well in advance because of the precision in the ordering.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:10.520]   I believe, I've come to the conclusion that the precision in God's ordering work is infinite.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.480]   His work is infinitely precise.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:19.760]   Even though we sometimes look and we see what is chaotic, in the trees, if you will, of
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.120]   the forest, there's a precision in the ordering.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.360]   We're only limited by our ability to measure it.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:33.420]   And that's very easily seen in history and the best illustration for that is the measurement
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.680]   of time, right?
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:42.160]   Human progress has been directly proportional to the precision that we've been able to measure
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.160]   time.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.720]   Nowadays, we take it for granted.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.200]   All of us have a smart device probably in our pocket or a pocketbook.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.680]   The only reason they work is because they're all synchronized at some few milliseconds
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.880]   and I don't know what the number is.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.840]   But it enables things like that.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:07.680]   So there's a precision in the ordering and the progress made in scientific endeavor has
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:14.080]   increased the accuracy of measuring that precision, of finding it and measuring it.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.480]   There's a lawful contingency.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.760]   That was the third presupposition in science and that, what does that mean?
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:28.260]   That means that the laws, what we call laws of nature or whatnot, the mathematical equations
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.880]   that we all take for granted are not written on a bumper sticker on creation, right?
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.000]   They have to be discovered.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.840]   They have to be searched out.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.240]   And the history of science has done that.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.080]   But that's a presupposition.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.360]   There's a lawful contingency.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:51.680]   What we see in God's creative work operates in an ordered way, that ordering is precise
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.280]   and it operates by laws that can be discovered and searched out and applied.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:03.400]   That's a presupposition that informs our scientific endeavor in answering the call.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.800]   Now, how can we tie this to scripture?
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.000]   Well, I go to two verses.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.080]   In Christ, all things are held together.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.920]   That means they cohere.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.360]   That's why we call it a universe.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.720]   There's a coherence to it.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.880]   There's a logic to it, but it's not obvious.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.220]   We have to search it out.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.360]   We have to find it.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:32.640]   And that's the subduing, the dominion effort to search out what God has provisioned for
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   us.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.080]   And it comes right there in Colossians chapter 1, or Hebrews chapter 1.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.280]   He upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:49.840]   And I love this because the word "uphold," translated "uphold," is related to the word
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.080]   in Colossians, but it's a different word.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:02.560]   And it has an element of it, in addition, that suggests moving forward toward a goal,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.000]   to fulfill a purpose.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:13.480]   So he upholds the universe by the word of his power, his work of sustaining his universe
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.640]   for an ultimate goal.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:22.760]   And we can point, of course, to the new heavens and the new earth, ultimately, as the goal
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.080]   with our biblical worldview.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.000]   But these were very important, very important for us in our presuppositions of science.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.760]   So we need to have presuppositions in science, and I believe these are a great place to start
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.520]   from a biblical worldview.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:48.400]   Now, given this worldview, then, it's a good reminder for us all to consider our vocation,
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.600]   the areas that we work, our calling, our assignment.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.760]   And in the interest of time, I'll give you those passages as homework as well.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.440]   1 Corinthians 7 and Colossians 4.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.280]   We have a duty to answer the call that God has given us in life, right?
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:13.600]   It is our assignment in life, and that's what Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.720]   In Colossians, Paul's given a reminder, "Hey, tell somebody to fulfill the ministry you've
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.660]   received in the Lord."
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.520]   So they're good reminders for us.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.840]   What are the elements of that?
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.920]   Well, it includes what I started out with.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:35.440]   We view and comprehend this worldview perspective, our calling, our vocation through the lens
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   of redemption.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:42.760]   And, Jennifer, you gave a wonderful testimony for that in the answering of your call as
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:49.160]   in God's providence, he unfolded the details of your life.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.800]   So we need to always go back to that, always go back and reestablish, affirm, establish
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:01.080]   our understanding in those basic elements of a biblical worldview understood only because
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.720]   we've been granted by grace that wisdom, right?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.660]   Which comes by the fear of the Lord.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.280]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and that's granted by grace.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.040]   That's his work of redemption.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:20.200]   And only then can we begin to understand our calling, our vocation.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   It's recognized then as a gift of grace, unique to you, unique in your abilities, God-given
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.360]   abilities, and also your opportunities.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.400]   It is a gift.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   The opportunity that you have to work out your vocation is a gift from the creator to
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.120]   you, uniquely, and we're all unique in this.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:50.040]   We're all uniquely placed in time, place, and circumstance with unique abilities and
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:55.200]   more important, unique opportunities.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:02.080]   And those opportunities can be considered both a personal and a corporate outworking
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.560]   of providence.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.800]   It's personal for each of us, and I think that's probably obvious to each of us.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:14.920]   We can look at our lives and see how God has providentially orchestrated the circumstances
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:21.000]   of our life to equip us, to give us opportunities, to help us discern the path when we come to
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.560]   a fork in the road, to maybe open doors or close doors.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.160]   We see that personally.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.760]   It's important also to see it corporately, right?
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.920]   Because we're not here for ourselves.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:39.400]   We're here for the good of mankind and for the glory of God and to give witness to him.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   So in fact, there's a, not Charnock, but John Flavel, another Puritan, wrote The Mystery
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.600]   of Providence, which I read in the early '90s, the first time I think I've read it six times
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.800]   since then.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.200]   It really opened my eyes to see life in this perspective, that we are uniquely placed in
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:08.080]   time, place, and circumstance, and uniquely called to our labors in life, and we actually
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:16.120]   have a duty to see God's providential outworking in life and to acknowledge it and to give
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:26.600]   thanks for it and to accept it for our good, as was rehearsed in the earlier session, and
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:33.280]   to see it as both personal and corporate outworking of providence.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.840]   It's also a stewardship, and that's also been acknowledged.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:49.960]   I am not by nature inclined to step into a limelight for public speaking or to attract
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   attention.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.920]   My inclination is I'd rather hide in the shadows, I'd rather just do my work and not be known
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.580]   and seen.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:05.360]   But I recognized going into the NASA opportunity of the stewardship of life, and I recognized
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:14.720]   that that would bring unique opportunities or unique experiences that would draw attention.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.960]   So how was I going to react to the attention given?
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:23.160]   Was I going to go hide in the shadows, which would be my natural inclination, or would
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:30.320]   I steward them in a responsible way, and given the opportunities that the Lord has given
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.880]   me, give testimony to him?
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:39.080]   So that really summarizes that understanding of that stewardship, and the responsibility
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:45.160]   that comes with the calling that we're given by God summarizes the reason that I'm even
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.120]   here talking to you.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.400]   And each of us have that responsibility.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:58.320]   Each of us have a stewardship of life, of opportunities, of abilities, of all the things
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.120]   that we engage with life.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:06.840]   We are to steward that for the good of mankind around us and for the glory of God.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.760]   It's fundamental to understanding calling.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:19.460]   And that all comes with, as was also witnessed to us so marvelously, with I would say a growing
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:30.040]   gratitude and anticipation, and with the motivation for God's glory and the good of others.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:35.560]   So in biblical terms, then, we are all called to be scientists.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.000]   And I'll tell this to everybody, those that aren't scientists.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.760]   If you understand this, and you go back to Psalm 111, verse 2, and it was called the
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:50.480]   Scientist's Psalm for that reason, in that sense, like Luther said, all Christians, all
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.240]   believers are theologians.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.600]   They're to be students of God, right, to study God.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:01.760]   In a similar way, we are all called to be scientists, to be delighting believers in
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:09.600]   the studied works of God.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   So another way to say some of this is, we shouldn't ask ourselves what we are doing
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:25.200]   in this, but what is God doing in and through us?
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:31.380]   That's another important aspect of our understanding of our perspective.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:39.500]   What is God doing through you, in you, and through you, and that then in part answers
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.180]   the call of what we are to steward.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:50.980]   The other thing is, it's often common for us, and maybe you've experienced this, to
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.100]   be driven, right, in your work.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:00.220]   We're not to be driven, we're to be called.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.220]   There's a difference.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:08.540]   I moved to Washington State three years ago, and we arrived on election day, when Biden
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:14.860]   won the election, and everybody was distraught, and shortly after that, people were leaving
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:21.220]   and moving to Florida and moving to Texas, and I said, "Don't run away," and they'd
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.340]   say to us, "Why'd you move to Washington, this liberal state?
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.140]   It'd be like moving to California.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.860]   Who wants to go there?"
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.900]   They were being driven away.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.740]   I felt we were being called up there, right?
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.100]   We can fall victim to that.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:42.500]   We can be driven in our profession, but we're to be called.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.940]   Those driven toward satisfaction will be found dissatisfied, is a quote I found.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:50.780]   Those called are called toward anticipation, right?
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:55.700]   We can anticipate what God has in store when we're answering the call and not being driven
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:02.700]   by achievement or goals.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:07.900]   Science is to be a task pursued and carried out in the spirit of praise and worship.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.400]   In our work, we see God.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:17.220]   We see his works of provision, his works of providence, and we see his purpose and wisdom,
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:25.300]   greater the works of Yahweh, studied by all who delight in them.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:29.140]   Let's pray and then go to Q&A maybe a little bit.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.900]   I can't see with that light there.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.260]   I can't see the time, so I have no idea if we have any time.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:42.940]   Dear Heavenly Father, we come before you marveling at who you are and how you have revealed yourself
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:49.220]   in your works, your works of creation, your works of provisioning and ordering your creation
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.340]   in such amazing ways.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:55.860]   When we consider the work that you've given us in our calling and the opportunities given
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:03.060]   in life, it magnifies the significance when we consider these basic fundamental truths
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:07.100]   of Scripture in which you have revealed yourself.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:13.180]   Lord, help us be established with that biblical understanding, that biblical worldview to
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:20.220]   be faithful to answer the call that you've given each of us to steward the opportunities,
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:26.620]   to steward the talents that you've given us, Lord, for the good of those around us and
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:32.820]   the good of future generations and ultimately for the glory of God, in whose name we pray.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.820]   Amen.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   Amen.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.820]   Thank you so much.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:45.900]   Thank you for the encouragement to be excited.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:51.500]   I love the reminder that because we're steward, we're pressures off.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:57.020]   The Lord is doing the work, and I just love that because we can definitely feel pressure
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:04.240]   to be ministers of the gospel, but the Lord is orchestrating all of that.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.660]   If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to pass the microphone to you.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.700]   Please raise your hand.
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.100]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.460]   Thank you so much for the nice talk.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:18.140]   So I had a question on something you were touching on towards the end about this theme
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:23.860]   of calling, but I think you've mentioned before just in your past visits at the Master's University
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:30.300]   that sometimes folks will see your gifts and talents and maybe before you went to the Master's
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:35.340]   Seminary sort of say, "Jeff, wow, your work at NASA is so amazing, but when are you going
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.340]   to go into ministry?"
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   Thank you for that reminder.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.420]   So I was wondering, like, should we all just quit and go to seminary or can you speak to
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.420]   that?
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.180]   If you really want to be sanctified, quit what you're doing, go to seminary and start
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.700]   doing real church work, right?
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.740]   No, most of us have struggled with that question, right, and we've heard those voices around
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.200]   us or whatnot, but no, that's absolutely a lie.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.020]   We're all in ministry, right?
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.980]   And I would get that question even back, I remember the early '90s, you know, "Are you
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:10.060]   thinking about going in ministry?"
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:18.580]   I get that all the time, and I kind of maybe evolved, no pun intended, in my understanding
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:25.540]   of that, but very quickly I got to an easy answer, "I'm already in ministry."
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.900]   And each of you are in ministry, right?
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:34.300]   There's not this dichotomy that I think was talked about yesterday between the sacred
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.980]   and the secular.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:41.140]   All of life is sacred, the work that we do, wherever we're doing it, is sacred, right?
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:45.780]   So we're all in ministry, we're all giving witness, we're all giving testimony, we're
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:51.500]   all answering the call that the creator of the universe, who is also our redeemer, has
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:58.940]   given us, and each of us in a unique way, each of us contributing to civilization around
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:03.700]   us, the community around us, the extended family around us, the family in our household
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.300]   in unique ways, answering the call of God.
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:10.220]   We're all in ministry through all of life, in all aspects of life.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.340]   There's no division.
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.660]   It's all sacred.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.560]   Thank you for that.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:19.980]   She actually gave me that charge a year ago, so...
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.660]   - Any other questions?
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.980]   - Yes, over here.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:35.260]   - So being in outer space, I would imagine it was probably unusual to be floating around
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.280]   and not being sustained by gravity.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.060]   After being in space for so long, how was being able to transition back to being used
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.900]   to gravity after floating around in space for so long?
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:47.900]   - It was very difficult.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.940]   I call it the relentless force of gravity.
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:54.620]   When you come back, then you really appreciate the force of gravity.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.900]   You're in a weightlessness for six months at a time.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:02.680]   We exercise every day up there to try to maintain the strength of our muscles, and we're able
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:08.580]   to do so pretty successfully with our major muscle groups.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:12.420]   By the way, I just got back from Singapore last Sunday, so that's why I'm catching my
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:17.900]   thoughts here once in a while, still recovering from jet lag.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:18.900]   It takes a...
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.360]   But you can't exercise and isolate every little muscle in the body that we take for granted
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.300]   and use just moving around in a gravity environment.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:34.180]   So it takes about six weeks working with a trainer, and we have a very well-developed
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:41.420]   program that's been developed over years to regain not only our strength, but our flexibility
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:48.740]   and coordination, magnifying that when we first get back for the first week or week
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.020]   and a half is we...
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:55.180]   When you first land and you try to stand up for the first time, you have absolutely no
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.740]   sense of balance because your vestibular system has been ignored by the brain because it's
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:02.820]   made no sense for six months.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.180]   It's not functional in that environment.
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:09.180]   So you're completely reliant on visual cues.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:14.180]   So the first time you stand up, and I did it just as an experiment, I stood up right
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:21.300]   away and I had to focus on not only sustaining the strength to remain standing, but also
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:27.100]   concentrate on staying upright and not falling over using visual cues.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:35.260]   And I could not stand up if I closed my eyes because of the vestibular awareness, which
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:40.380]   lasted a week and a half or so.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   I think I can't stand up with my eyes closed anyway, so you're doing great.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:58.020]   The quote you gave about the difference between being called versus being driven, can you
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.100]   tell us where that quote came from or was that yours?
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.580]   I got it from someplace.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.860]   I wrote it in notes.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.860]   I don't remember.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.020]   It might've been Oz Guinness.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:11.420]   Oz Guinness wrote a book called The Call, which had a big impact on me back also in
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:16.660]   the late '90s, I think is the first time I read it.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:21.340]   We can understand when we're driven by something, what's the source of being driven?
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.980]   It usually comes from within, right?
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.980]   It's us.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:34.940]   And it's pursuing some achievement or some goal, but it comes from within.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:41.860]   Calling is a perception that's external to us.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.500]   And I liken it to the political moves or whatnot.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.180]   I tell people, don't run away from anything.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.700]   Don't be driven away from anything.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.020]   Be called to.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:58.700]   Even when we move around, right?
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:05.100]   We should respond to an external calling of circumstance, of need, of necessity, of open
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:12.540]   doors, not just be driven there on our own without, or worst case, being driven away
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:16.420]   from someplace, not knowing what you're going to.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.420]   That's the difference.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   Does that make sense?
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:26.900]   Sorry, we have one here and then I'll go up front.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.140]   Sure.
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   Being in close proximity to other astronauts, do you have deep conversations, are you able
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.500]   to give the gospel message?
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.460]   Are there other believers?
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.460]   What's that like?
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:48.820]   Yeah, that's kind of an assumption that goes into the question I talked about or related
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.700]   to what I talked about at the beginning where you get this question, how can you work in
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:59.300]   that field and be a believer or whatnot, which reveals the perception that the area of science
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.900]   is for nonbelievers, right?
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.620]   It's just not compatible with the Bible.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:10.340]   I give other talks on that conflict that I talked about between scripture and science,
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.340]   which is rooted in history.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:18.020]   I call it the most successful propaganda campaign in modern history, which is rooted primarily
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.700]   in the 1800s and then into the 20th century.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.900]   The answer is it's no different than here on earth.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.740]   Up there, I have flown with other believers and there are many believers.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740]   I would say many.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:36.580]   There are several believers in the astronaut corps, in the U.S. astronaut corps.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.380]   I know of one from Canada.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.220]   I don't know of any from Europe and none from Russia.
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:50.800]   I know from Russia a few that are orthodox and some are very devoted orthodox.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.300]   But I did experience opportunities to have conversations.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.060]   Some people, you have no opportunity, right?
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.460]   They're just not interested.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.500]   They know of your faith, but they're not going to give you an opportunity to enter into a
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.500]   conversation.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.980]   Others had great conversation about looking out the window and seeing views like you don't
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:15.940]   see on your screen and just the awe and wonder of viewing the earth.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.860]   So you talk a little bit about God's creation and acknowledging God and whatnot.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:25.940]   And others had opportunity to actually get into talking about Christ and the gospel.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.260]   It's always one-on-one.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.100]   Peer pressure will usually prevent us from having a conversation if there are witnesses
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.100]   around of any kind.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.340]   But we're still witnessing, right?
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340]   We're still witnessing.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:45.500]   I always had a, in fact, no, this one didn't, but I always had a paper Bible on board with
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:54.420]   me and I usually had it out and with rubber bands, you know, kind of held open.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:59.220]   Otherwise all the pages kind of float up on a table just outside my crew quarters.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.880]   So I mean, you're giving witness to your faith.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.020]   Some would engage with me.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.340]   Others would avoid engagement just like here.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.500]   I never had a hostile reaction by God's grace.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:17.900]   I've never been asked to, I've never been censored or been asked not to speak.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.780]   I use discretion like we all should, right?
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:26.220]   When I go into a public school, I don't present the gospel in my presentation.
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:35.580]   But because I'm, in those days I was representing NASA, you know, in my official capacity.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:40.740]   But as soon as we get to Q&A, it's inevitable that questions come out that are personal
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:45.740]   in nature regarding faith and view of God and whatnot.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.740]   And then it's personal.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.540]   Now it's my personal perspective.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.580]   And there's been plenty of opportunity for that.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.460]   And we all have those kinds of opportunities as well.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:04:05.020]   I know it takes discernment, right, to navigate through those circumstances.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:11.260]   Thank you, Colonel Williams, for presenting so well the biblical foundations for doing
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.260]   science.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.420]   I think that's, well, probably in this group you said like you're preaching to the choir.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:22.260]   But we need to know that and tell it to our students and even be ready when someone who
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:27.460]   doesn't share our biblical foundation that we say there is this foundation, the presuppositions
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.460]   you mentioned.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.460]   Anyway, thank you for doing that.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:36.780]   I was going to ask you, if you care to comment, what do you think about the future of the
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.740]   International Space Station?
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.700]   Well, the plan and the policy for the station is to continue flying it.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:49.340]   And we will continue flying it as long as we have the political support among the partners
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:55.780]   and that the leadership is with NASA and the U.S. to continue flying it unless there's
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:01.220]   some catastrophic thing that occurs that prevents us from doing so.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.100]   There's a lot I could say about that.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:10.580]   You can go -- but ultimately it depends upon the technical durability of it and the political
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.660]   support to fund it.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.780]   So the policy is to fly it now at least till 2030.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:22.020]   And you hear in the news all the time, okay, I got a question yesterday or this morning.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.660]   I heard the station's coming down.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.100]   Well, the news always reports on this over and over again.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.860]   When we started building the space station, it had a lifetime out to 2015.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:40.060]   And then it got extended to 2020, I think, and then extended to 2024, and then 2028,
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.060]   now 2030.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:46.980]   We're already working to certify it technically to 2034.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.980]   So that's been the progression.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:52.940]   As long as it makes sense policy-wise to continue flying it, we have that political support
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.620]   to do so and the funding that will continue.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:01.700]   I think everybody realizes if we would end the program, we'd be on the ground indefinitely.
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:06.420]   And you might be aware that there's a lunar program in development right now.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:11.620]   The pace of that lunar program is going to be very slow just because of the level of
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.620]   funding.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:17.100]   It's also going to be an international partnership, which adds another layer of complexity.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.180]   But it also solidifies the political support of it.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:25.780]   I think the only reason we're flying in space now is because we partnered with the Russians
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:33.820]   in 1992-93 because of the geopolitical motivation in that partnership, not for space flight,
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:38.420]   but at the time for nonproliferation of nuclear and chemical weapon systems.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.660]   We didn't want those things going to Iraq or Iran or North Korea.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.180]   We wanted to engage with this new Russia after the fall.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:51.860]   And this was one way proposed and accepted to engage with them, to take what was Space
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:57.160]   Station Freedom in the '80s, announced by President Reagan, and what would have been
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:04.140]   Mir-2 in Russia, and come up with a proposal to integrate them together.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:09.900]   And that became the International Space Station, which is another whole talk and story.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:23.740]   But an amazing, amazing history in God's providence.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.940]   Thank you for your encouraging talk, blending the Word of God with even sharing how we can
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.660]   think about the theology of it in our personal life.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.420]   I guess the question I have is about, you know, you mentioned something incidentally
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:39.700]   at the beginning of your talk, how a lot of people are influenced by YouTube and things
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.700]   like that.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:45.660]   I'm sure in the capacity that the Lord's put you to do ministry, how do you help believers
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:51.900]   who may have good theology even about the sufficiency of Scripture, but being led astray
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.660]   by these things like YouTube?
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.060]   How do you think that through and minister to people?
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.500]   Yeah, you're talking about like flat Earth as an example?
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500]   Yeah, a lot.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.380]   There's so many things.
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:08.380]   And I first heard about that when I got sent up to me some comments on social media in
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.100]   my last flight in 2016.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.940]   And when I first read about flat Earth, I thought it was a parody.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:21.460]   I thought it was humor, satire, and it wasn't until I landed in the fall that I started
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.420]   getting more on the internet and seeing, oh no, this is a real thing.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:32.020]   In fact, I found a chapter of the Flat Earth Society in my city, in League City, two miles
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.740]   from NASA Johnson Space Center.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:40.020]   And when I went on the road talking, especially in churches, I would get that question all
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.060]   the time.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:46.140]   And usually it was, hey, it was not, I'm a flat Earther and you're a liar.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.420]   Usually it was, hey, I know somebody, there's somebody in our congregation or I have a brother
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:59.300]   or I have a cousin or a friend who believes in the flat Earth, can you help me with that?
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.100]   And in the beginning I tried to engage logically in the argument, to make the argument that
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.660]   no, the Earth is in fact not flat, that it's as we've been taught in school.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:13.140]   But I quickly realized that in part because I was part of the conspiracy and I was a liar
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.700]   and I wasn't going to be believed anyway.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.460]   And there was no logic in the argument.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:27.000]   It was a fabrication of interpretation of a few figurative texts in scripture and other
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.980]   things and primarily the authority of YouTube, some influencers out there, which is a new
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:38.020]   word in our vocabulary in that context, that there was no logic behind it.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:45.080]   So my answer quickly got shortened to utter foolishness.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.700]   And that's all it is.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.700]   It's utter foolishness.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:55.300]   And it's a testimony to our fallen nature and the impact of the fall into sin on our
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:01.860]   nature and our inability that we all have, by the way, to some degree, our inability
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:08.500]   to think clearly, logically, clearly, or, you know, consistently.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.860]   Thank you so much.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:17.740]   If you have more questions, please see Colonel Williams over lunch.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:21.820]   And now we're going to break for lunch, but before then, would you please pray for us?
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820]   Sure.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.700]   Dear Heavenly Father, we come before you again, reminded of your provision, your provision
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:30.740]   of even gathering us together here providentially in this place.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:35.060]   We pray that through your provision, through your grace, that we can be an encouragement
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:40.960]   to one another, to strengthen and establish us in our faith, that we may give glory to
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.460]   Christ in our calling and in our work.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:51.000]   We also thank you for the provision of food, the basic necessities of life, Lord, and we
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.260]   pray your blessing upon the rest of this symposium, as well as your blessing upon the food that
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.980]   we're about to receive to the nourishment of our bodies to give us strength to continue
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.980]   in the answering of the call.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:03.980]   In the name of Christ.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:03.980]   Amen.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   Amen.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.120]   Amen.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:06.620]   Amen.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.120]   Amen.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:07.620]   Amen.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:08.120]   Amen.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.620]   Amen.
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.120]   Amen.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
