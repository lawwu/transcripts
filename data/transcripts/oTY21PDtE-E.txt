[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   - Navigating tax advice on the internet can be tricky.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.240]   So today we're digging into what most people get wrong
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.700]   about taxes and tax law,
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.800]   the myths that keep spreading wildly on social media
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.520]   and how to avoid costly mistakes when you file.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.680]   I'm joined by Jasmine DeLucci, a seasoned tax pro
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.000]   who became an enrolled agent
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.960]   while she was still in high school.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.400]   She knows this stuff inside and out,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880]   and we're gonna dive into the strategies and tactics
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.240]   to help you save money and take control of your taxes.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins.

[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.080]   Jasmine, what do you think is wrong
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080]   with so much of the tax advice you see on the internet?
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.440]   - I think a lot of my criticisms keep coming back to,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.760]   people just look at the statute
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.080]   and then they make up in their mind what the law is.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.160]   And so, right, 'cause we think, oh, well statute,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.040]   we've got the law, like that's it, right?
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.080]   And, but if you've watched any of my content,
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.440]   you know that we've got several layers of law, right?
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.680]   Tax law has statute, treasure regulations, court cases,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.440]   and then we even have more guidance from that,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.240]   like revenue rulings, revenue procedures.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.160]   So I think people that, people don't love when I say this,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.160]   but it's like people that are really deep in tax law
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.920]   just don't tend to post online.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.640]   So what I tend to see is the people that post online
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.400]   tend to have a very surface level of tax law.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.840]   You know, they'll learn a little bit and they're like,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   well, shoot, do I wanna work myself to death
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.280]   and make 1/100th of what I could?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880]   Or do I just wanna post random thoughts online
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.640]   and make like 100 times more?
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.000]   So then they butcher that basic stuff and say it wrong.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.320]   And I think it's genuinely like they don't know.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.560]   It's not like a malicious intent, but most people just,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.200]   when you read base level tax law,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.640]   you get the wrong answer a lot of times.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   And that's what they're doing.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200]   - Is there an example that we could just use
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.040]   for everyone to understand something that you see posted
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.440]   all the time on the internet that just isn't correct?
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.700]   - Yeah, clothing is a big one.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.000]   Clothing or fashion accessories or even like haircuts, right?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.920]   We think of all these personal things.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.840]   And so the first thing that's so fun for people to post,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.320]   there was this one video that I use as an example
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.720]   where this licensed tax preparer is saying like,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.320]   well, I deduct all my haircuts 'cause they're my brand.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.360]   And he's like, well, I deduct my blue suits
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.160]   because blue is my brand, right?
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.120]   And that's your perfect example of,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.000]   he's saying he's relying on IRC 162,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   which is our classic ordinary necessary business expenses.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.680]   So you go there and you say, okay, yeah,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800]   well, it says ordinary necessary business expenses.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.400]   The mistake he's making is he's looking at it and saying,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.160]   I think it's ordinary necessary to my business.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.960]   And so it's literally just like made up in his mind
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.320]   when obviously what we wanna do is go to the tax law.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.160]   So then what do we do?
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.680]   We look at treasury regulations.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.560]   For this one specifically, it doesn't help us.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.320]   So then we go to court cases.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.840]   The court cases say, that's cute,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   but you're gonna get a haircut anyways.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.240]   They say personal grooming, it's just so,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.680]   it's so inherently personal,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.520]   it can't be for business purposes.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.080]   And then we get that same result for clothing.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.960]   There's actually a three-part tax court test for clothing.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.440]   And so the one that everyone violates is,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.280]   it's like, it can't be suitable for personal use,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.520]   even if you only use it for business.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.080]   So a blue business suit, very suitable for personal use,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.720]   therefore not deductible.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.520]   - Now, I remember one time my wife
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.440]   was selling to college campuses
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.040]   and part of their brand for the company
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.240]   was everyone bought like big animal,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.640]   like almost Halloween costumes.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   Presumably that's not like a personal use.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.960]   So that might've qualified as a business expense,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.720]   but a suit, a shirt, a haircut, all these things are not.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.160]   - You obviously wouldn't have purchased that
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   for personal reasons because at the end of the day,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000]   tax law, a lot of times they just look to substance, right?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.960]   We wanna look at the laws,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.440]   but they're almost always built in a way
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.160]   to go back to substance.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.440]   And so why did you really buy it?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.040]   Well, I mean, you probably bought a blue suit,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.400]   like, yeah, you're working in it,
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.040]   but like you can use that for whatever
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.240]   and you probably are using it for whatever.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.960]   And so they just draw a line there to prevent abuse
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.040]   versus, yeah, I mean, something like super unique,
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.560]   there's probably no way she would have gone out
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   and purchased that for any other reason.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.680]   - Definitely not.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   And we're not just gonna talk about business related things
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.920]   in our conversation,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.440]   but I wanna double click a little here
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.360]   on what would actually happen, right?
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.720]   Like if it got to the point that you had to debate this,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.140]   is it kind of like innocent until proven guilty?
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.640]   Or like, do you have to be able to explain that,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.700]   well, I actually live in the hottest part of the country.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.600]   I never wear suits outside of when I'm on video in my studio
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.280]   so I actually think this suit is a business expense
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.360]   'cause I would never wear it for personal reasons.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.400]   - Yeah, there's always a practical element to it
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.880]   and I think that's also why people have gotten
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.160]   so comfortable giving whatever advice
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.400]   because first off, they don't do too many IRS audits
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.240]   and then when they do,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.600]   honestly, IRS auditors aren't super knowledgeable
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.520]   a lot of the time if you're a small business.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.120]   So practically speaking,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   if you just spend too much on clothing,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.160]   they'll probably just disallow it.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.000]   Now, if they look into it and they say,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.120]   well, what were they?
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.680]   And you're like, well, they're suits.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.400]   It's just like at that lowest level,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.640]   they're probably just gonna deny it.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.800]   Now, not to say you couldn't then introduce like,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.480]   well, I've got my logo plastered all across the front of it
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.600]   and it made it super ugly
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.560]   so I would never wanna wear this thing for personal use.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.200]   So there are like arguments you can start to pull out
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.000]   and the way I view it is if you're on bad law,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.680]   like you wanna be more careful, right?
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.440]   And I think what a lot of people are doing online
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.800]   is they're pretending like it's good law
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   and so then if you get into the argument,
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.040]   like you have to be super careful
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.720]   and you may still be able to get it through
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.560]   if you didn't abuse it so much
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.200]   because it's not gonna be noticed.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.480]   Otherwise, you're gonna have problems.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.600]   - Yeah, and by bad law and good law,
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.840]   you've kind of highlighted before
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.120]   that there's the statutes,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.680]   there's the treasury regulations and the court cases.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.280]   Would bad law be where there's a statute
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.240]   but it's been heavily kind of scrutinized
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.640]   or clarified in other ways?
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.000]   - Yeah, I would say bad law is like,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   if I do a full research and I look up what the answer is
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.360]   and I'm like, wow, everything's against us.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.320]   The levels of authority you typically wanna have,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.760]   we call it like substantial authority.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.440]   So a 40%, 40% of what's out there
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.200]   is like gives you a good position.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.720]   And if for things like you think of haircuts,
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.200]   I've pulled all the court cases.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.120]   They all say no, like it's just what it is.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.040]   So then you thinking, well, it's yes, right?
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.240]   A lot of people like to use the example of like Botox
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.000]   or different types of enhancements and stuff.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.600]   And it's like, we've got the court cases
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.520]   and they just kind of laugh at the taxpayer
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.580]   every single time.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.240]   And so when people all see like license preparers
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.360]   recommending it or they'll say,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.080]   oh, this is a case of first impression.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.200]   It's like, you're saying that
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.600]   because you haven't looked up all the court cases
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.620]   that actually exist already.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.160]   - So I looked at a handful of the most common things
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.380]   on social media and one that I've seen a lot of
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.320]   is around hiring your kids.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.360]   And this one seems like both I understand it
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.040]   and it also seems a little skeptical.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.280]   Do you have any thoughts on that?
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.120]   - A lot of the themes I repeat, one of them is substance.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.640]   It's like, we know with tax court, we know with tax law,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.360]   we've got substance of reform.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.060]   And so whatever form you put it in,
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.200]   it will always go back to like, what were you really doing?
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.900]   I think if you're genuinely working in the business,
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.240]   they're genuinely adding value.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.040]   And then you also do wanna keep in mind
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.520]   things like state laws.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.360]   If you are violating other laws,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.920]   typically that alone can be a reason
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.480]   the IRS could deny something.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.240]   I do think to some extent, if you are careful in areas
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.400]   where the substance is light,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.040]   then you wanna be really strong on procedure, right?
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.160]   If you're gonna hire your kids,
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.560]   we want procedure to be really strong.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.880]   Well, what would procedure be?
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   That's all those technical formalities, right?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.640]   I want an employment contract, I want an hours log,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.920]   I want a calendar, I wanna know exactly what they're doing.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   We wanna actually issue a W-2,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.620]   so we have really strong procedure.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.400]   The substance is a little light, they're your kids,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.800]   we're like a little bit skeptical,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.680]   but we've got all this proof that actually
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.920]   we've got some substance there.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.060]   Where people tend to go wrong in these types of areas
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.320]   is they do neither, right?
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.000]   The substance is light because, you know what?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.440]   It's my kid and I'm just kind of paying them
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.180]   to take out the trash and I would never actually pay,
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.240]   whatever, $15,000 a year for someone to take out the trash.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.520]   And then, oh, by the way, I have no employment contract,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.040]   no proof, nothing.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.800]   Whereas that might hold in a third party arrangement, right?
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.240]   If I hired a random person off the street
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.720]   and paid them 20,000 a year,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.960]   I may be fine with not having an employment contract.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.120]   I may be fine with not having all these technicalities,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.580]   but because there's no related party nature,
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.880]   it doesn't get the same scrutiny.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.760]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.880]   And one of the things that I noticed was interesting
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.200]   was in a lot of these kind of videos
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   talking about all these great tactics,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.120]   they don't clarify that even if you were doing them
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.600]   by the book, even if they were appropriate,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.680]   if you just have a W-2 income
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.400]   and you're working at a company,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.640]   like you can't write off your meals,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.680]   you can't classify your car as a business expense.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.880]   And a lot of these things that I've heard people
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.040]   one-on-one talking to them say,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.220]   I work at Google and I'm taking a friend out to lunch,
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.260]   I'll just write that off.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.260]   And I'm like, well, one,
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.300]   I don't know if you could write it off
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.900]   even if you did own the company.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.960]   And two, I don't think you can do this as an employee.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.180]   So are most of these things even relevant
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.140]   to people who don't own businesses?
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.540]   - So ever since the tax reform passed in 2017
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.460]   that started in 2018,
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.540]   there were some that would apply at the time.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.900]   There used to be,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.900]   you have to still get over that itemized threshold,
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.100]   but things like home office,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.300]   you could take some of those things.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.040]   But it was a, actually I had a professor
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.740]   who was a part of drafting all of the tax reform
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.580]   at that time.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.900]   And they obviously had to fit within a certain budget
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.420]   over 10-year projections.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.380]   And so because they made so many cuts in other areas,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.820]   they had to have certain areas
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.820]   where they increased the revenue.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.460]   And one of those was basically eliminating
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.340]   all of the deductions for employees.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.420]   So right now, absolutely not, you get nothing.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.100]   - What advice do you have for people
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.460]   for how to handle and scrutinize tax advice on the internet?
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.580]   How do you think people should try to figure out
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.340]   what's good and what's not?
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.460]   - At the end of the day,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.000]   you want to actually get real professional advice
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.460]   if you're gonna rely on it.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.940]   So ideally finding someone that you actually trust
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.020]   that can apply it to your situation.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.320]   And I think social media serves as a great way
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.740]   to introduce the question,
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.900]   not necessarily that they have their answer.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.040]   - And when you highlighted there's statutes,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.420]   there's treasury regulations, there's court cases,
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.140]   all of these things can also be found.
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.100]   So I would encourage people to go look them up.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.180]   I'm gonna share one example
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.220]   that's particularly relevant to the audience,
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.460]   which is I've often talked about how credit card points
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.340]   are treated as a rebate and they are not taxable.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.740]   So I've recently heard some people questioning
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.980]   whether that's true.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.820]   And the argument being really more on the business side,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.420]   well, if you're using this to generate a profit,
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.820]   should it reduce your cost basis
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.860]   in whatever you bought or not?
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.660]   And so I looked and there was a revenue ruling
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.660]   that said a purchase incentive,
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.620]   such as credit card reward or points
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.020]   is not treated as income,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.740]   but as a reduction in the purchase price
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.340]   of what is purchased with the rewards or points.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.060]   And then there was this case where they actually decided.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.280]   And what I thought was interesting was they decided
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.120]   this couple had generated a few hundred thousand dollars
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.560]   in rewards on two credit cards,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.840]   buying gift cards and then kind of liquidating
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.000]   and reselling them as well as funding money orders.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And the takeaway was when used to directly buy money,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.820]   which they only included the money orders,
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.800]   you are turning a profit and that would be taxable,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.600]   but to buy a gift card,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.140]   which they felt was more of a product, you're kind of okay.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.140]   And so, yes, I could go online and look all these things up
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.960]   if you wanna get clarity around it.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.200]   If you're doing a little bit of this,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.400]   maybe it's kind of okay to do a little bit of digging,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.960]   but if you're generating hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.400]   of rewards a year,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.960]   it might be worth going to read these yourself.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.240]   - Yeah, or hiring even, reading them yourself,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   realizing that maybe there's not full clarity
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.720]   and then maybe even hiring someone
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.960]   to give an opinion on it, right?
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.000]   'Cause there's always, I mean, you're never,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.380]   I don't view it as like you're ever fully safe, right?
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.660]   Like at the end of the day,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.060]   you can have an awesome, easy,
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.780]   clear tax position with the IRS,
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.100]   like not something as complicated
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.740]   as the credit card rewards,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.180]   and you still face issues in audits.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.580]   Like the reality is people think,
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.100]   "Oh, I'll just be good, I'll just," you know,
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.980]   but there's just so much bureaucracy.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.340]   You have to check so many boxes
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.280]   that even safe positions are questioned in an audit.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.160]   So I just view it as like,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.260]   you just wanna protect yourself, like risk averse.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.420]   So if you're taking a slightly more aggressive position,
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.860]   you can predisclose it on the return on an 8275,
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.320]   and then you're allowed to rely on less authority
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.740]   to take that position
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.660]   and reduce your exposure for IRS penalties.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.660]   And you quite literally disclose positions
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.620]   that you still have to have a basis for,
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.460]   but you're allowed to,
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.960]   instead of having substantial authority at 40% basis,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.500]   you're allowed to have, I think it's like 20% basis
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.380]   in your authority.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.040]   So you're allowed to rely on less like law.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.880]   So whenever I have situations where I'm like,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.380]   "Well, this is something that I feel comfortable with.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.460]   "We've got support for,
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.100]   "but there is some support on the other side
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.480]   "that I don't love."
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.020]   We can always proactively disclose it.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.500]   And I've never seen that trigger an audit
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.700]   or do anything like that.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.620]   - Okay, so that's basically saying,
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.180]   "Hey, I'm not as sure,
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.380]   "but I wanna let you know that I think I'm sure."
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.180]   - Yeah, saying, "I've got authority for this."
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.700]   You know, but it's something you may disagree with.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.020]   So I'm just gonna proactively,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.120]   I'm not trying to hide anything.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.280]   I'm trying to be really clear about it,
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.180]   tell you the authority that I'm relying on.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.140]   And yeah, and it's worked every time I've done it.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.060]   I've never had an audit result from it, so.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.940]   - And let's talk a little bit about audits.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.980]   Almost everyone I know is scared of them,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.380]   but don't actually understand them.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.220]   Can you talk a little bit about what happens
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.820]   if you get audited?
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.180]   - Yeah, the audit process,
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.500]   I've been trying to provide a lot more clarity for it
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.300]   because unless you're just doing it,
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.900]   there's nowhere else you can learn about it.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.800]   It's just, it's not, to me, it's not common sense.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.160]   So when you get audited, I mean,
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.640]   that part is what you would expect.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.720]   Like an auditor comes in.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.440]   I do think people assume the auditor is really sophisticated,
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.240]   which if you were a much larger business,
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.560]   like there's different divisions, right?
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.380]   So if you're a very large business,
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.320]   you're gonna probably get someone sophisticated.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.000]   But most people are under
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.400]   that $10 million gross receipt threshold,
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.340]   in which case they honestly,
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.400]   like these auditors are in the middle of training.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.720]   They have so many check boxes to get through.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.640]   Like they're just paper pushing.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.520]   And I don't mean that, you know, say it to be mean,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.760]   but it's just, it's government, right?
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.560]   They've been put into a position where it's like,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.480]   just check these boxes, like just collect this,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.440]   check the box, collect this, check the box.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.080]   They're not really put in a position
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.200]   or trained to think too much.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.000]   And so first off, I see people like way over explaining.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.200]   If anything, I always make it such that I don't want
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   my client to ever even talk to the IRS
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.600]   and there are sometimes they're more insistent than others,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.520]   but there's never a positive that could come out of it.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.600]   And I mean, you probably hear this
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.000]   in like every area of law, right?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.120]   People think, oh, I'll just explain everything.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.360]   And like, they'll just know that I'm not guilty, right?
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.520]   But they don't really care.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.880]   They're there with their specific list
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.920]   of things they need to get through.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.160]   And so I always try to avoid that.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.380]   Honestly, a ton of adverse decisions at the lowest level.
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.880]   Like they're looking for receipts.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.840]   Missing the receipt, denied.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.440]   Missing the receipt, denied.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.280]   That's it.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.120]   And a lot of times they just try to get everything
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.160]   unless you control it.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.480]   So they'll ask for literally the back end of your books.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.960]   They'll ask for every receipt known to man.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.980]   And then that's where ideally you have representation
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.680]   coming in being like, okay, well,
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.560]   we're not gonna give you the books
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.440]   because we actually printed everything out for you.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.600]   And we're not gonna give you 8,000 receipts.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.840]   So why don't you choose a sample size list
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.400]   of ones that are representative
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.160]   of the things that you're concerned about, right?
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.360]   So trying to limit that.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.000]   But even with great representation,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.600]   I would say at the lowest level,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.480]   we just have adverse decisions against us.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.520]   And that's where I think a lot of people think,
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.560]   oh no, I lost.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.600]   Like it's so expensive to go to the next level.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.060]   Like what do I do?
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.760]   To me, like I'm pretty quick to say, okay,
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.720]   if we're just not getting there with this person,
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.020]   then we just go to appeals.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.800]   And appeals is where you really get someone
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.160]   that is actually, I don't know,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.320]   like they're more concerned with the substance,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.520]   like the big picture.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.160]   So not to say they don't care about it at all,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.200]   but they're less gonna be like,
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.440]   I need that receipt for this $40 meal.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.120]   And they're more like, okay, well,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.680]   is this person a real estate professional, right?
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.000]   And so then at that point,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.780]   if you still don't get where you need to go,
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.720]   you can go up higher.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.220]   You go to IRS counsel before actually heading to tax court.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.960]   We almost never actually go to tax court.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   It's usually, like if you're actually going to tax court,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.320]   you're probably a very large company
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.840]   because I would say they give more adverse decisions
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.200]   than negotiating with IRS counsel
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.560]   and negotiating with IRS appeals.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.920]   So if you weren't able to resolve
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.140]   with IRS appeals and counsel,
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.000]   you're probably going to lose in tax court.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.440]   - Obviously, it's all subject to audit.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.220]   But if there's something that looks egregious,
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.800]   do they put scrutiny on that thing that looks egregious?
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.560]   Or as soon as you hit that audit,
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.440]   they're like, we're gonna look at everything.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.760]   - They pretty much look at everything.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.600]   - Okay.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.960]   - Yeah, they may have picked it up
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.560]   for the thing that was egregious, right?
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.540]   So whenever you have like a massive loss on it,
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.840]   or maybe too much charitable contributions,
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.540]   that might've been the reason it was flagged.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.380]   Every now and then,
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.600]   an audit might be limited to specific items,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.160]   but usually they're like,
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.920]   oh, there's a Schedule C, give me all the receipts.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.720]   There's a Schedule E, give me all the receipts.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.960]   You know, you did a rental,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.720]   give me your material participation log.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.840]   - And just a personal question,
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.240]   on the receipt side,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.800]   do you think that credit card transactions justify receipts?
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.920]   Or do you really need like the receipt receipt?
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.680]   - You need the receipt at the lower level, right?
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.200]   So that's, it's everyone's question.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.180]   And maybe the IRS, like if the IRS were up with the times,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.100]   they would change that policy,
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.380]   'cause it's just ludicrous, but they're not.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.180]   They're like very behind on technology.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.620]   Just everything is very slow moving.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.620]   So, you know, they can barely find enough people
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.700]   to take the jobs that they need.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.540]   So no, at the lower level,
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.180]   I mean, I have a lot of IRS appeals,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.060]   IRS audit cases at appeals,
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.020]   where what happens is people will not have the receipts.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.260]   Literally the auditor will just deny everything.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.060]   A lot of times, this is a generalization,
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.060]   but a lot of them will just say,
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.080]   oh, no receipt, nothing.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.920]   And they'll just be like,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.840]   pretend like there's not a business.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.100]   Like, we'll just recognize the gross income
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.960]   and deny every single deduction known to man.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   And that's where appeals won't do that.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.120]   They, there's what we call the Cohen rule,
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.680]   which is it's a, it's formed in tax court, right?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.240]   So it's not a law formally,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.600]   but it's a doctrine created by tax court
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.120]   that basically says, it's to the extent of like,
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.320]   we can see there's a business,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.360]   we can reasonably estimate the amount of the cost,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.800]   the like, expense that you had,
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.120]   we can reasonably estimate what it was on,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.280]   which I would say credit card transactions
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.760]   and bank statements can meet that threshold to some extent.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.560]   Then they're, they allow the expenses,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.840]   but it's intended to be like a fairness doctrine,
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.720]   not so much like an offensive sword against the IRS.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.200]   So it usually works at appeals and never,
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.720]   I mean, I've never have it really work
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.760]   at the lower auditor level.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.440]   - And are there common things that flag people for audits?
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.720]   - Yeah, I definitely, I mean,
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.120]   negative schedule C's, negative schedule E's,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.960]   large losses will flag.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.400]   I see a lot of audits by association.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.360]   So if you're involved in something else that has a problem,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.720]   so I've seen people with,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.920]   maybe you have like a conservation easement,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   conservation easement is under scrutiny
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.760]   and getting audited, the IRS doesn't like those,
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.920]   you know, you're there by association.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.840]   I've also seen audits jump from person to person, right?
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.120]   So I, a lot of in the medical area,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.240]   especially like kickbacks,
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.760]   if you had someone that got audited
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.040]   because he was written a check from the person
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.440]   with the problem, and then they look at your file
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.960]   and they say, oh, this person got a check,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.040]   that check said ROI, this is a little sketchy.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.360]   And then they say, oh, you haven't filed, boom, audit.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.120]   - What about when you're amending returns after the fact
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.520]   and making changes, does that put you at higher risk?
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.560]   - If you're asking for lots of money back, yeah.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.880]   That's also one of the ways I'll see people audited.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.680]   So it's, you think about common sense, right?
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.320]   You filed your own return wrong.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.840]   You already got it wrong once.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.720]   And now you think, whatever, you're owed $200,000.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   And process-wise at the IRS, it actually,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.920]   amended returns actually land on someone's desk.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.600]   So it's not the same as like a superseded return
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.480]   or an original return,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.160]   which is basically automatically processed.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   An amended return is much slower.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.120]   It takes like honestly nine months up to a year sometimes
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   'cause it actually just gets stuck on someone's desk.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.240]   And then if you think about a human, right?
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.480]   A human looking at something, if you're like,
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.560]   yeah, just I'm owed $300,000.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.840]   We got all of these line items wrong
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.560]   and we changed literally everything.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.760]   I mean, it's just so easy to like push it to the audit.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.520]   - And how long does this whole process take?
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.520]   'Cause I got a new CPA who reviewed my 2019 return,
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.080]   found a five-figure mistake
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.720]   right before the deadline to amend.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.440]   We amended it, I feel like over a year ago
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.200]   and we literally just got the refund check.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.040]   - Oh, nice.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.860]   - Now.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.700]   - That's good, that's good.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.880]   - But it's 2024, it's almost 2025.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.080]   It was like an 18-month process.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.020]   When the IRS does flag things for audits,
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.840]   is that months later, years later?
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.280]   - It just varies.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.200]   You can, so I know I always say this,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.740]   but you can check your IRS transcripts.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.400]   You can actually see if you've been flagged for an audit.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.360]   So that'll tell you up to six months before
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.120]   it'll be like forwarded for an audit.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.540]   So that's one way to check.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.800]   The amended returns take a long time.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.840]   Now, honestly, sometimes they get stuck on people's desks.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.040]   Like they literally just sit there.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.900]   So that's where sometimes we'll,
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.400]   we do this only after several months have passed,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.160]   but you could go through like the IRS tax advocate
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   and kind of check in on it and say,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.280]   "Yo, like no one's getting back to me on this."
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.000]   'Cause the IRS doesn't have to process your amended return.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.200]   Like in theory, they could kind of sit on it.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.480]   So usually they don't do that.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.760]   But there are instances where it's like,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.240]   "Is anyone gonna get here?"
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.360]   At some point, you don't wanna just wait.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   - When you do get it wrong,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.960]   I have one example where a friend of mine got
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.340]   what they thought was a gift from a parent.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.260]   But what turns out was that parent had a business entity
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.640]   set up with all the children in the family as owners.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   And so that gift was actually a distribution from a company.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.400]   And they never got a 1099 or anything.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.520]   And like three years later,
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.120]   they found out that the gift they got
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.660]   from their parents was taxable.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.840]   But it took like years,
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   and they owed penalties and interest on top of that.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.280]   That seems like something that was flagged
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.840]   because the business entity submitted something.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.880]   Maybe they even filed the 1099 with the state,
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   but didn't send it to the children.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.840]   So that seems like something
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.880]   where it comes back to the transcripts.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.360]   I wanna talk about IRS transcripts,
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.080]   'cause that's actually the reason we're talking today,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.880]   because a really good friend of mine
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.120]   sent me a video you made about IRS transcripts
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.960]   and was like, "I've never heard about this strategy.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.800]   "It's amazing.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.120]   "You have to talk to this person."
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.420]   And so how are you using IRS transcripts
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.040]   to make sure you get things right?
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.260]   - Yeah, so you wanna check them.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.640]   So I was gonna say in that instance you just described,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.160]   there probably was a K1
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.540]   if you're telling me they're an owner.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.520]   - Let's even just define what they are for people.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.880]   It's the file the IRS has on you.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.520]   So if the IRS has a file on you,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.120]   why wouldn't you wanna see it?
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.360]   It's publicly available.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.920]   They make it electronic.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.320]   You can literally just create an account with the IRS,
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.640]   log in, and then there's multiple types of transcripts.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.400]   So you've got your account transcript,
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.000]   which is gonna show the base level of your account.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.320]   It's gonna say what payments have you made to the IRS,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.960]   for which tax year has your return actually been filed?
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.040]   Has your amended return been received?
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.860]   So it's very much those base level things,
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.480]   which like if I'd filed an amended return,
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.160]   the first thing I'd be looking to see,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.080]   did the IRS receive it?
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.520]   If they didn't receive it, you could wait two years
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.400]   and then be like, where's my refund?
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.760]   And then they'll say, well, we didn't get it.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.000]   Now you're outside the statute of limitations.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.240]   - And how quickly are those kinds of things updated?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.600]   Like if I file my return today,
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.400]   how soon will it show that it's been filed?
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.640]   - Usually at least a couple of weeks.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.360]   It still takes a little time.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.280]   So a couple of weeks if you did it electronically.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.980]   Now, if you mailed it, it could be like six months,
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.020]   nine months.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.420]   I would say after waiting a couple of months,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.380]   if it's not there, I would be very concerned.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.880]   And usually you always wanna have proof
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.220]   that you already submitted.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.480]   But yeah, so that's the account transcript.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.540]   So I look to that for like if you made a payment
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.980]   and sometimes they receive it, they cash it,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.300]   but they don't credit it to your account, right?
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.600]   So did it also get credited to my account?
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.460]   So all of those details.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.300]   Then when you go to the wage and income transcript,
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.380]   that's the one that would avoid most of the problems.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.000]   So that's the one where if a K-1 was filed
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   with your social on it, if a 1099 was filed,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.040]   every document with your name and social
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.280]   is gonna be on there.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.140]   And that's the one that...
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.960]   The problem is if you check too early,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.340]   you won't have all the information.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.080]   So it populates by the following year.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.960]   So for example, right now we're in 2024.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.920]   If you want your 2024 wage and income transcripts,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.400]   you'll obviously need to wait till next year
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.960]   because things like your W-2,
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.440]   all of that stuff hasn't even been filed with the IRS.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.040]   And then takes time to populate.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.540]   Usually a safe time to check
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.560]   is gonna be June of the following year.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.040]   - So that means that in order to check,
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.260]   you would have to by default file an extension
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.440]   and not file in April.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.020]   - Yeah, so what I recommend is
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.920]   we wanna do one of two things.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.960]   If you wanna file early because you wanna refund,
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.560]   usually is the reason, the only reason.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.920]   Then extend.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.040]   So for example, extend in February, file by April.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.520]   But then if you notice a problem,
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.140]   you wanna check in June or September,
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.560]   whenever before the final deadline.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.240]   You can file a superseded return.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.640]   And so the reason we like superseded returns
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.040]   is one, they process faster.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.640]   And then two, you don't have that page.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.840]   You know you have on an amended return,
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.360]   you have that page of original change, difference.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.120]   Like you're highlighting the problems
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.000]   that were there instead.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.800]   It's just literally submitting a new original return.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.640]   - Okay, and so it's not ending up on someone's desk
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.920]   like an amended return would.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.200]   - Yeah, but the only reason you can do a superseded return
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   is if it's timely.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.740]   So if you never extended in the first place,
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.700]   then you'd have to do an amended return
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.980]   if you're filing after April.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.760]   But if you extended and then filed,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.740]   you're still technically timely until October 15th.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.980]   - I think one takeaway for everyone listening,
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.280]   W2 employee, business owner, even if you file in April,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.560]   there's no extra cost or risk
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.100]   to just also filing for an extension.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.940]   - Yeah, and you just have to file the extension
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.280]   before you actually file the return.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.220]   So file the extension, then file the return,
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.980]   and then May, June, check your IRS transcripts.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.980]   If anything's off, file a superseded return,
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.580]   and you're in a way better position
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.580]   than if you filed an amended return.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.540]   And if nothing's off, then you're fine.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.980]   You already filed, you're done.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.800]   - That's what I would do.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.640]   And I mean, eventually,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.540]   hopefully the IRS will start publishing transcripts earlier,
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.660]   but right now it's, you know, they don't.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.480]   So it's like either you do that work yourself,
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.100]   even though we could say in fairness,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.100]   you shouldn't have to, right?
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.660]   Like, I think there's always this argument of like,
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.180]   why should I have to do that?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.860]   But if you're gonna be the one holding the bag,
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.380]   you probably should just do it.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.900]   'Cause the alternative right now,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.260]   based on the way the IRS operates,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.200]   is they give it a good two to three years
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.140]   and then send you a notice with penalties.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.980]   - Yeah, and if they, what happens on the flip side?
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.660]   Let's say in my case,
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.420]   I filed an amended return years later,
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.500]   then they took another year and a half to pay me.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.800]   Do they have to pay me penalties and interest?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.460]   - Not penalties. (laughs)
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.060]   There is some interest, but it's not,
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.860]   it's not for the time that passed.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.740]   It's for once you file your claim for refund,
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.240]   then the clock starts.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.460]   They have, I think it's like 45 days to process it.
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.060]   And if they go wildly outside of that,
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.100]   then they can pay you interest.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.900]   Yeah, they will pay you interest.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.740]   - Okay.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.520]   - But the risk you run, I mean, what to me,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.360]   what's always very scary
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.100]   is being outside the statute of limitations, right?
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.660]   So with refund requests,
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.060]   which is what an amended return is,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.620]   if it has a refund on it, you have to have specificity.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.860]   So what I see people do,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.580]   especially with not great preparers,
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.220]   is you file the amended return,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.180]   you don't put enough detail,
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.260]   you blow the statute of limitations.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.900]   If they were able to process
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.980]   that specific amended return, it'd be fine.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.020]   But if they say, "Hey, this amended return
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.480]   "doesn't have specificity, we're rejecting it."
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.060]   Now you're past the statute of limitations,
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.780]   you can no longer ask for the money back.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.680]   - And what is the statute of limitations?
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.520]   - It's the later of three years from a timely filing
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.260]   or two years from payment.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.100]   - Okay.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.340]   And so, does that fit into your favor
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.340]   in a way that filing earlier gives the IRS less time
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   to come back, 'cause it works both ways, right?
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.020]   If they wanted to come after you
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.060]   and you filed right on April 15th,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.860]   they'd have less time than if you wait
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.700]   and file on October 15th.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.700]   - Yeah, so that is one consideration
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.740]   that by extending and then filing later,
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.460]   you are extending the statute of limitations for them.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.700]   I haven't seen any correlation
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.980]   between them like auditing those people less
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.760]   or being less likely to pursue.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.980]   - My argument would be if you're banking
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.340]   on the statute of limitations
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.060]   to allow you to do something you shouldn't do,
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.100]   you probably shouldn't have done it in the first place.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.940]   - Yeah.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.840]   - Is there anything else you do personally
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.420]   with your taxes like the IRS transcripts
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.860]   that you think people listening might benefit from hearing?
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.420]   - I personally extend, I always want simplicity
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.700]   in everything, right?
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.940]   So not that we don't wanna maximize the tax benefit, I do,
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.260]   and I care a lot about that as well,
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.500]   but I will say there's, I care a lot about
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.860]   not just minimizing my taxes,
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.860]   but also minimizing penalties, interests,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.220]   and honestly problems, right?
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.060]   The more busy you get, especially in business,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.180]   but honestly in any area,
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.340]   like I know how painful it is to work with the IRS.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.440]   Like even if I got audited today,
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.860]   I would be stressed about it.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.700]   Now I'd be in the driver's seat,
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.780]   so I'm not gonna like crazy worry,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.140]   but it would stress me out because I know
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.920]   just the time that it takes, just the time it takes
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.180]   would be honestly a huge loss in money to me, right?
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.520]   Huge loss in energy, effort, everything.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.900]   So everything I do is built around that,
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.660]   and obviously transcripts is one of them.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.100]   I like to actually extend so that I have a clean,
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.260]   I want one return submitted, that's it.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.880]   And then everything I do is clean.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.460]   So it's like, if I think I'm gonna assume
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.420]   the IRS is looking at my return,
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.740]   if there's anything that doesn't look good,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.340]   I would prefer to not make it stand out, right?
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.620]   So whether it, without misrepresenting.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.320]   So if someone were to look at it and you labeled,
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.260]   I don't know, meals as, I don't know, something not meals,
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.040]   then I think that's misrepresenting,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.320]   but you could also do certain labels
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.680]   that just don't pull out attention, right?
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.760]   So I might not label gifts, gifts.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   I may label it a part of something else
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.380]   that represents what it is.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.500]   So for example, I actually have a good client
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.800]   that I've been working with.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.280]   They're under audit and they're about to file.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.640]   So whenever you're under current audit,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.680]   they're gonna look at the return
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.640]   and then decide, do I wanna audit this return?
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.400]   And so things like clearing out any schedule Cs
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.240]   with a loss on them.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.960]   I don't care if you truly had a loss.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.240]   If we can remove,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.780]   I would rather not take the deduction at that point,
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.840]   knowing that it's gonna be under scrutiny
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.360]   if the deduction is small,
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.200]   rather than highlight the fact that we've got something
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.360]   that looks really interesting to look into.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.640]   So those are the kind of decisions,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.360]   sometimes it's aesthetic as well.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.320]   - I was just thinking about how you look
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.640]   at the IRS transcripts and you're probably comparing them
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.000]   to your set of documents you've received.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.080]   How often are the documents, the W-2s, the 1099s,
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.000]   actually incorrect themselves?
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.720]   - It happens all the time, especially 1099s.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.440]   So W-2s are usually accurate
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.880]   'cause they have to match up with the rest
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.980]   of the IRS's records on actual withholdings
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.200]   from the employer.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.600]   But 1099s, I will see all the time.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.680]   I log in to someone's account and it's a 1099-C,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.320]   it very often incorrect.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.440]   It's just like issued in the wrong year.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.260]   It's something the client wasn't even aware of.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.700]   Yeah, or just, I mean, for regular 1099s,
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.200]   you have to remember, it's just another human
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.600]   issuing it on the other side.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.520]   I was talking to someone that the bookkeeper
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.240]   added a zero to the 1099.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.120]   And it's like, whoever's filing those 1099s,
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.320]   a lot of times it's the administrative assistant, right?
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.280]   And if you were paid $2,500
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.000]   and that administrative assistant makes it $250,000,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.800]   like that is what the IRS will have on file
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.560]   and they'll automatically add it to your return.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.920]   - And what about ones from banks and brokerage firms
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.520]   showing mortgage interest or interest
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.480]   from your savings account or brokerage transactions?
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.320]   - If they're incorrect, there's like not even much
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.880]   you can do about it a lot of times,
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.940]   but I don't tend to see huge errors on those.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.000]   Those tend to be correct, yeah.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.520]   - And when you find something that's not on an IRS
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.860]   transcript, but you have, you got a 1099, the IRS didn't,
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.560]   is that a cause for concern?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.720]   Is that, do you try to look into why?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.920]   Or you just kind of accept that they might've missed it
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.560]   and you're gonna include it no matter what?
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.280]   - It probably wasn't the IRS missing it.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.800]   It was probably the employer not filing it with the IRS.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.640]   - Okay.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.600]   - Yeah, so that's what I would assume.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.280]   And then, you know, you'd look at it and say,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   well, did I receive the income?
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.480]   If I received the income, you're supposed to,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   you still report it, yeah.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.640]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   Okay, anything else that people should be thinking
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.760]   about high level?
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.160]   I wanna hear if we're missing any things
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.620]   about how to think about filing and taxes.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.040]   - High level, I think people tend to rely too much
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.320]   on their expert, you know,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.440]   especially when their expert's not an expert.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.240]   And so to me, I always view it as like,
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.120]   you're the one holding the bag, it's your tax return,
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.360]   you're literally signing under penalties of perjury.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.280]   The IRS cares about you, not your preparer.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.760]   So doing, that's why I like to put out so much information
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.320]   because it's actually just something you need to understand
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.120]   even if it's something you're not that interested in.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.940]   - I was talking to someone at a conference
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.400]   and she was looking to, she was interviewing for a job
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.040]   at Intuit working on TurboTax.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.720]   And she's like, oh, you think about this a lot.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.440]   What do you think of TurboTax?
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.160]   And I was like, look, it can help you fill out the forms
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.760]   and they might have some policy where they're like,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   we will defend you, but at the end of the day,
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.880]   if you use the tool wrong,
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.220]   you're gonna fill out the forms wrong
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.360]   and that's not on them.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.840]   What's your take on when someone could rely
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.100]   on a tool like that versus need a preparer
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.480]   versus just fill out the form themselves
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.140]   without needing any software?
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.840]   - Yeah, I think it's an assessment,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.160]   ideally an unbiased assessment of your own skills, right?
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.520]   Some people just have no business preparing their return.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.960]   Even if it's on the simpler side,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.520]   they will find a way to mess it up,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.680]   just not their thing, being timely.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.440]   I mean, there's benefits to a preparer
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.840]   beyond the actual knowledge, right?
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.280]   A lot of times it's like peace of mind,
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.440]   it's just timeliness, like it's actually
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.020]   just gonna get done.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.240]   So assessing your own skills.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.380]   And then at that point, I mean, TurboTax is great
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.220]   for whenever you've got clear tax documents
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.480]   that just need to be input, it will do it perfectly, right?
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.620]   But I've seen people misuse it.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.240]   Like we had an IRS audit where they,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.080]   I don't know how they did this,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.480]   but they used TurboTax and they input
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.400]   their Schedule C stuff on both Schedule C and Schedule E.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.800]   And I think they don't know how to read the output
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.240]   and they're the preparer.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   So I think when it's W2 stuff, like TurboTax is great
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.440]   and if anything, they're better than hiring someone
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.100]   who doesn't care about their return
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.180]   as much as you care about your return.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.060]   But once you start going into business
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.420]   or if you're taking any specific tax positions,
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.820]   I would just find someone that knows what they're doing.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.940]   - All right, and because it's October
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.020]   and this will come out before the end of the year,
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.300]   I'm gonna share some of the things
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.220]   that I try to do before the end of the year
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.380]   and you can let me know if there's anything else.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.140]   One, which is not often possible,
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.180]   but accelerating or deferring income or expenses
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.800]   and I would say this is sometimes possible
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.920]   where if you've decided, okay, this year I'm gonna itemize
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.740]   or I'm gonna take the standard deduction,
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.800]   you might be able to make an extra property tax payment.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.120]   Now, right now with the current limits,
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.440]   there's $10,000 of state and local taxes,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.400]   but if you were not at that limit,
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.920]   maybe you wanted to kind of make extra tax payments
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.400]   or mortgage payments in one year
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.060]   and then the next year switch it off, switch off.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.920]   So that's one.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.260]   Or if your company offers the ability to get paid a bonus
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.980]   and defer it for a few years.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.860]   So thinking about whether there's any income or expenses
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.820]   that you can move around, that was one.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.980]   Making charitable donations with the caveat
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.940]   that I think everyone should be donating to charity
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.020]   with appreciated assets, right?
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.920]   If you're making any donations to charity with cash,
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.500]   you're effectively leaving money on the table
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.540]   if you own any appreciated assets.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.680]   So if you own any stock that you bought
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.420]   for less than it's worth today,
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.500]   those are the things you should be donating.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.620]   And if that's not simple,
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.980]   because the places you donate don't take stock,
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.340]   you can pretty inexpensively set up a donor advised fund.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.100]   People that listen to the show for a while know
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.040]   that Daffy has been a partner,
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.000]   it's where we use our donor advised fund.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.180]   There are other options,
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.620]   not many are as simple and good in my opinion.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.380]   For any equities, if you hold any stocks
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.620]   that are actually not at a gain, but are at a loss,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.300]   you can harvest those losses.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.740]   Now you can't buy the exact same thing,
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.940]   so you wouldn't wanna sell your Google stock
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.260]   and then rebuy it unless you wait 30 days.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.540]   But if you held a S&P 500 index fund and it was down,
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.960]   and you wanted to buy a different index fund, you could.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.820]   If you're holding stock options,
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.820]   so specifically ISOs, depending on how many you exercise,
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.900]   it may affect your taxes, but sometimes,
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.980]   and this is one where I would say,
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.820]   work with a professional for sure,
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.540]   there might be a number of ISOs you could exercise
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.940]   that wouldn't put you into AMT
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.940]   and cause your taxes to increase.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.140]   And so if you're trying to exercise some ISOs,
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.140]   that's possible.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.700]   A common one is if you have an FSA,
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.120]   make sure you use it all,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.900]   because if you don't use it all, then you lose it.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.500]   So FSAs, the employer is gonna keep the money
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.580]   if you don't use it by the end of the year.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.920]   And I would say even if there's absolutely nothing you need,
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.760]   there are places online where you can buy things
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.600]   and donate them.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.500]   So if you, there are medical supplies
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.940]   that many shelters need, at a minimum,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.900]   buy some of those things and donate them
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.460]   even if you don't have expenses.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:36.460]   And then there are HSAs, retirement accounts, 529s,
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.980]   all things that have annual limits.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.820]   So if you wanted to contribute to those,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.460]   make sure you do that before the end of the year.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.820]   If you wanna give any gifts,
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.900]   so if you're trying to gift money to your children
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.540]   or family members, those gift exemption limits
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.340]   reset each calendar year.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.300]   And then if you own a business,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.660]   think about whether there are any business expenses
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.800]   that you wanna get done before the end of the year.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.180]   Sometimes you might want them this year,
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.860]   sometimes you might actually want them next year.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.420]   But I have been able sometimes to ask vendors,
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.420]   "Hey, could we pay for this thing a little early right now?"
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.320]   Or maybe you have, you know, net 30, net 60, net 90,
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.880]   but you wanna pay for it right away
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.140]   so that you can have the expense in that calendar year.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.300]   And like, did I leave any glaring thing off that checklist?
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.180]   No, that was great.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.380]   I think the one that I like to talk about a lot
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.580]   is for business owners,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.660]   just because I actually see no one talking about it.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.860]   If you have a business, you want to,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.260]   and especially if it's an S-Corp,
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.860]   so specifically for S-Corps,
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.120]   but really for any type of business,
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.180]   checking your tax basis.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.100]   So I know it doesn't sound like super exciting
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.420]   like some of those, but it's a timing difference.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.860]   And so there's a situation where basically
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.140]   if you take out the money in December from your business,
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.140]   you'll pay quite literally a voluntary tax,
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.780]   capital gains, because you accessed that money
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.380]   versus had you just waited until January
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.860]   to take the money out, there would have been no tax.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.020]   So there's a timing difference,
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.460]   especially with S-Corps that have lots of depreciation
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.380]   and third-party debt, where if you take the money out,
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.020]   you quite literally create an extra layer of tax
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.860]   just for fun.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.700]   Wow, okay.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.140]   So that's one that I would say go check with your CPAs on.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.700]   And then the only other one completely untax related
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.540]   is that if you have credit cards
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.680]   that have all these annual credits,
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.500]   like an airline credit or a hotel credit,
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.420]   make sure you use those before the end of the year as well,
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.380]   because those often reset.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.300]   Some of them are on the card member year.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.460]   Some of them are on the calendar year.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.660]   I'm gonna put together a list of all the things
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.760]   I just mentioned and a few other ones
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.980]   that I find in the newsletter.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.340]   So allthehacks.com/email,
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.460]   and that'll come out sometime before the end of the year.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.540]   But when you just said S-Corps,
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.060]   I wanted to ask about a couple business things.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.040]   Specifically, you've said S-Corps aren't as awesome
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.860]   as people might think they are,
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.220]   and that people thinking they should just set up an LLC
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.900]   to save money on taxes probably might be mistaken.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.060]   And I've had a couple friends say,
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.900]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, I run everything through my LLC,
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.220]   "so I save money."
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.460]   And I'm curious what you think about that.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.660]   - Yeah, well, I mean, the tax law is the tax law, right?
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.800]   It doesn't say like, if an LLC, it's treated this other way.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.340]   It's based on the tax entities.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.840]   An LLC is a legal entity, not a tax entity.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.980]   So just forming an LLC does nothing.
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.780]   It doesn't make a business deduction a business deduction.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.740]   A business deduction is either already a business deduction,
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.240]   or it's just not.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.540]   And running it through your LLC is,
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.420]   it's kind of that procedure versus substance.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.660]   It's the procedure, and it's not what's controlling.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.540]   So the substance is like, what did you spend it on,
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.100]   and do you actually have a business?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.120]   So that alone, I would just, I like to keep things simple.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.780]   If you don't have legal liability,
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.100]   and you're not doing anything other than sole prop treatment,
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.460]   you probably don't need the LLC, or at least recognize
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.540]   it's not providing a tax benefit.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:53.540]   And then, S-Corps are, they work really well for businesses,
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.660]   like service industry, whenever there's not much equipment,
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.420]   and not much third-party debt.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.260]   They work really well.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.360]   And then the minute you have more of a business
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.700]   with lots of vehicles, and usually those vehicles
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.580]   are financed, right, or real estate,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.780]   all of those typically need to stay out of an S-Corp.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:11.900]   - Okay, I feel better, 'cause I was like,
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.340]   I saw you talking about S-Corps,
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.520]   I was like, oh, I have an S-Corp,
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.460]   but don't have a bunch of vehicles,
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.780]   don't have a bunch of third-party debt,
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.700]   and don't have real estate.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.860]   So maybe I'm in the clear.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.220]   - Yeah.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.420]   - Anything people should think about
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.340]   with a little bit longer horizon than the end of the year,
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.300]   given that I know the current situation,
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.060]   I mean, obviously we have no idea what's gonna happen
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.860]   with an election that, as of right now, is in days,
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.700]   but the Tax Cut Job Act is expiring.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.300]   Are there any things people should be keeping on their radar
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   in the next kind of 14 months as things to consider?
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.620]   - I mean, yeah, a lot of stuff is gonna expire.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.120]   So even like the qualified business income deduction,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.740]   I mean, there's lots of things that we've gotten used to,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.140]   lower tax brackets, all of that is set to expire.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.340]   And I mean, who knows at this point what's gonna happen.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.460]   So I mean, planning for it, maybe sometimes you think,
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.980]   oh, well, I wanna push up my income for this year
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.840]   or for next year before QBI expires, right?
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.300]   And so it could make a bit of a different decision
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.180]   if you account for the expiration.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.000]   - Yeah.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.300]   The other one that will probably be relevant
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.900]   to a very, very small number of listeners,
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.920]   but I do know some listeners that meet this requirement,
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.860]   is that the estate planning,
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.460]   kind of the gift tax limitations are going to be changing.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.420]   And so I believe it's something like 13.6 million
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.700]   per person in a married couple
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.040]   is gonna come down to about seven, I think.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.340]   I don't know the exact numbers,
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.780]   but if you're sitting on tens of millions of dollars
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.780]   that you one day would like to give away to your heirs,
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.460]   now would be a really good time
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.660]   to figure out the estate planning to do that.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.140]   - Yeah, if you're gonna be over the new threshold
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.340]   once it expires, you'd basically wanna figure it out now
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.260]   because there's no clawback.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.660]   Like if you use up the full, whatever, 23,
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.180]   whatever million it's at now between a married couple,
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.860]   if you use that up by usually some type of like contribution
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.460]   to an irrevocable trust, then there's no clawback.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.580]   So you'd want to hurry up and probably use it up
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.380]   'cause almost in every scenario,
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.100]   we're expecting it to go down.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.220]   - Yes, but similar to where we started this conversation
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.620]   with everything you see on social media,
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.960]   I've seen a lot of people being like,
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.140]   oh, you should set up this trust
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.620]   so you can give money to your children
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.880]   and not have to pay taxes.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.700]   And I'm like, that is true.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.620]   However, if the amount of money in your lifetime
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.380]   you're going to give to your children is less than,
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.180]   even let's call it just really conservatively,
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.020]   less than $5 million,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.700]   then you don't have to worry about any of this, right?
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.300]   Like sure, that limit could come down
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.860]   even more in the future,
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.620]   but right now it's over $20 million.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.660]   So I don't want people to think,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.400]   oh, mosh, I might leave $500,000 to my kids.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.100]   Do I need to set up a complicated trust?
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.120]   And the answer is no, you do not.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.960]   - Yeah, no, it would definitely hurt you to do that.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.080]   I mean, 'cause there's also costs of administering it.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.440]   Even knowledgeable people, I just saw a post the other day
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.720]   and someone's like saying how revocable trust
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.160]   helps you get step up in basis.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.560]   Like they're just making step up
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.080]   because you already get step up in basis.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.040]   So most of the tax benefits are already built in
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.800]   and really it just comes down to estate tax
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.960]   'cause income tax gets worse when you go the trust route.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.460]   It either stays the same or it gets worse
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.340]   depending on what type of trust you choose
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.060]   and then it's only that estate tax.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.960]   And then like we just said, the thresholds are huge.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.020]   So if you don't have an estate tax problem,
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.140]   you don't wanna pay to fix a problem you don't have.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.600]   - Now, the only thing we spent a lot of time
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.580]   at this conference talking about different trusts
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.740]   and all this crazy stuff,
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.340]   but for avoiding capital gains,
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.860]   you can potentially end up in better situations
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.620]   with some charitable remainder trusts
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.660]   and those kinds of things.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.420]   So if you're about to have a massive sale of a company
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.860]   or sell stock that you bought at a really low basis,
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.460]   like let's say you worked at NVIDIA the last five years,
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.700]   there's a world where you might not be crossing
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.900]   that 10, 20 million threshold,
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   but you might save money setting up a trust for that purpose.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.420]   I'm not the expert.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.820]   We did an episode a while ago on trust.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.940]   You absolutely want to work with an expert
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.900]   in this circumstance.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.580]   But outside of a few of those small scenarios,
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.780]   I would say, if you're not over these thresholds,
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.180]   then you're making yourself and your life more complicated.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.180]   That said, a revocable living trust,
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.900]   a will and like basic estate planning documents,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.660]   you should definitely set all of those things up.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.600]   I'm strongly in favor of those,
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.060]   but more complicated irrevocable trusts
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.900]   are probably for very specific scenarios
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.620]   that are not common to most people.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.020]   - Yeah, it always goes back to like,
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.100]   what are you trying to accomplish
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.420]   and does it actually get you there?
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.280]   And people talk about trusts a lot,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.920]   but the reality is they're really complex.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.980]   Like anybody that does regular domestic tax
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.660]   and just happens to like name drop random trusts,
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:54.180]   they're probably not super familiar usually on social media.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.820]   When you think of like charitable remainder trusts,
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.620]   it's because your purpose is different.
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.060]   It's not to keep the most dollars possible.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.220]   It's actually with a strong purpose for charity, right?
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.340]   So then of course there are tax benefits for that.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.660]   - Yeah, so if you're trying to pursue anything wild
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.180]   and crazy, talk to someone.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.440]   Where can people find everything that you've published
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.920]   and where can they go deeper on all of your stuff?
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.280]   - I'm just searching my name on YouTube and then Instagram.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.440]   Those are my main platforms and YouTube.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.880]   I've actually got a video coming out today,
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.680]   but I'm trying to do every couple of weeks now,
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.920]   I'm doing a nice long form that I'm literally
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   just going through court cases on a specific niche topic.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.760]   - Yeah, I proposed for anyone interested,
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.200]   I proposed that you go deep on the credit card stuff.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.080]   And if so, and you do it by the time this comes out,
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.280]   look in the show notes and I will link to that.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.460]   And you can go get a little bit of a deeper dive there.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.220]   - It's on my list, so let me see what I can do.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.300]   - Awesome, thank you so much for being here.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.460]   - Of course, thank you.
