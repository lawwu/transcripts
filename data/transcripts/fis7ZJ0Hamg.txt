[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Gene writes in to ask, "Pastor John, how do I handle the envy and jealousy that are
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.440]   eating away at me?"
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.320]   So envy and jealousy are two distinct topics here on the table.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.280]   Perhaps we can break this into two podcasts and address jealousy next time.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.680]   So Pastor John, start with envy.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.860]   What would you say to Gene?
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.280]   It's not wrong to want something that you don't have.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.200]   We usually think of envy that way.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.680]   I want that, something that person has.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.760]   In fact, we wouldn't even pray if we didn't want things we didn't have.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.520]   That's what prayer is.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   In fact, I would say all of life is either thanksgiving for what God has given us or
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.880]   aspiration for something that might be good for us.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.760]   So the question is, what makes envy evil?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.240]   What makes the wanting of something evil?
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.160]   Proverbs 37, "Fret not yourself because of evildoers.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.800]   Be not envious of wrongdoers."
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.880]   It seems like people were looking at those who were prospering in their wrongdoing.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.780]   They had things and they were feeling envious of it.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.120]   Or Proverbs 14, "A tranquil heart gives life to the flesh, but envy makes the bones
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.920]   rot."
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.080]   Or Matthew 27, "For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered Jesus
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   up."
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.440]   So envy is a horrible thing.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.760]   It resulted in the killing of the Son of God.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.560]   That was a motive behind the destruction of Jesus.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.080]   Or Romans 1, "Since they did not approve to have God in their knowledge, God gave them
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.120]   up to a debased mind.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.200]   They were filled with envy, murder, strife."
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.480]   Same thing in 1 Peter 2, "Put away malice and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   slander."
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.100]   So, clearly, this is a good question.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.440]   We don't want to be eaten up by something that crucified the Son of God and that is
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.820]   all tied up with hypocrisy and deceit and slander and evil.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.880]   So when I try to get at what the essence of it is and how to handle it, it seems to me
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.280]   that those texts have some clues in them.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.120]   It seems to be born, envy seems to be born of a restless heart that does not find God
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.700]   satisfying.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.960]   So we're craving and we're yearning, we're aching toward what somebody else has because
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.520]   God himself is not satisfying our soul.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.160]   So envy is a wanting something, some gift or some ability or some looks or something
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.880]   that somebody else has with one of two feelings that make it bad.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.320]   Either resentment that they have it and you don't and so your heart is irritated, not
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.000]   just that you want it, but that they have it and you don't.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.800]   And that's loveless.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.000]   And when we're upset that somebody else has something and we don't have it and it makes
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.920]   us irritated and angry, we know that lovelessness has gripped our soul.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.920]   Or a discontent, not just resentment that they have it, but a discontent on our own
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.240]   soul that makes us distrustful of God or angry at God.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.120]   Why didn't you give me that?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.480]   Why did they have it and I don't?
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.800]   Why did you withhold this from me?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.560]   I know Tony, in my teenage years, the fact that I couldn't talk in front of a group
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.400]   came the closest to make me envious.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.120]   I'd see these people who could speak so easily in front of groups and I couldn't.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.040]   Or to this very day, the fact that I read so slowly, I have to constantly go back to
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   God and say, "Lord, I could accomplish so much more, I think.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   If you had just given me the ability to read as fast as Tony Ranke could read."
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   No, don't start.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.600]   And you really have to revisit these things over and over again and lay them down and
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.840]   say, "God, I trust you.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   You are good."
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.200]   So I think at bottom, the remedy is not that I am speaking of being in need, this is a
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.480]   quote from Philippians, "For I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.240]   I know how to be brought low, I know how to abound in any and every circumstance.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.480]   I've learned the secret of facing plenty."
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.040]   So there you've got enough.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   Or hunger.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   Now you could start feeling envious.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   "They have more.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   I want more.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   I don't have enough.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.200]   They have plenty."
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.840]   And Paul says there's a secret of trust in the goodness of God that enables you to feel
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.680]   contentment in all that you have.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.440]   So I think the key is trust Him with what He has given us, and only ask for things that
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.640]   would honor Him more, and then be content with what God gives us.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   All right.
