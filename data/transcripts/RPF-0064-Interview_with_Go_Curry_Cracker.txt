[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   Ever wanted to save some money,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.060]   retire in your early 30s, and then spend the rest of your life traveling the world with your spouse?
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.800]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.320]   If it is just me, skip today's show. If you're interested in at least conceptually finding out how that might be possible,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.040]   enjoy today's interview with a couple who has done exactly that.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   [Music]
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.120]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host and guide
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   through the financial swamps that we all walk through every day.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.480]   Today's show is an interview with Jeremy and Winnie, who are travelers, writers, early retirees.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.440]   They retired in their 30s and are now traveling the world together.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.640]   [Music]
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.680]   Their website is called GoCurryCracker, and they write quite a bit.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.440]   They put out a lot of content, and it is all helpful, valuable content. And in today's show,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.400]   you are going to enjoy hearing at the beginning their story,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.000]   and then you're going to enjoy hearing some information as far as some of the actual
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.280]   strategies that they have put into place to be able to allow them to retire at a very early age.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.600]   I think you're really going to benefit a lot. And at the end, I mean all throughout, obviously,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   I'm going to encourage you to go over and check out their writing. Some of the content is really great in a written format as
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.480]   well, especially when we get into some of the nitty-gritty with taxes and financial planning stuff as well.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.080]   Go and check out some of the information that they have published on their website as far as that information.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   As you listen to this, I am currently in New Orleans, Louisiana, or at least I hope I am.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.280]   This show is pre-scheduled long before that, so hopefully that's where I am at the FinCon session.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.040]   So all these shows are pre-recorded. I hope you enjoy them. If you have any questions, shoot me a note.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.280]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com is my email address. One quick note.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.080]   Jeremy was in Taiwan, and the Skype connection that we were on got a little bit funky towards the middle of the interview.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.600]   I let it go for a little bit, and so you should be able to just pick out the words,
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.720]   but then it got so bad, and I waited for a time, and then I interrupted him and
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.400]   paused the recorder, interrupted him, and then asked him to reset. So then after we reset, then it got better.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.200]   So don't give up and discuss in the middle when it gets a little bit
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.080]   mixed up. I think you'll appreciate it. Just keep on listening, and then the connection will get better. Enjoy the interview.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.920]   So Jeremy, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. I appreciate your being with me.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.800]   So thank you for the work that you've done to build out your website at gocurrycracker.com.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   I have enjoyed your writing over the last couple of years,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   and I think that it can't possibly be
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.160]   overstated how valuable travelogues and information like yours is for people who are looking to pursue a similar path.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.880]   It's such a wonderful thing that today we can access the information so easily of other people's stories.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.480]   Would you share with us just a little bit about your background and your story,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.560]   especially as it relates to your journey through and to financial independence?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   Sure. So
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.560]   my wife and I, we retired in our 30s and we started traveling around the world.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.360]   We started that about two years ago.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.320]   The whole savings path, from when we decided really that
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.080]   early retirement and permanent travel was something we were interested in, took us about 10 years.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.440]   From when we formally committed to the plan until the day that I submitted my resignation.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.320]   And since then, we've been slowly moving from place to place.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.240]   We worked our way through Mexico and Central America, and we're in Asia now.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   We kind of started the blog a little bit to keep in touch with friends and family, and also to
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.040]   answer the question that I got from a lot of my co-workers about, "You can really do that? How did you do it?"
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   Also to share what we thought was a whole when we were looking for information.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.320]   How much does it cost to do it? We publish all of our expenses on a monthly basis.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.080]   Every penny we spend.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   Yeah, that's probably one of the most helpful resources.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.160]   I know that I'm interested in long-term travels,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.080]   taking a year abroad type of thing, and the most valuable thing in the world is when you can find someone who accurately tracks their expenses.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.800]   And says, "Here's what it actually cost us."
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.480]   And so you can have an idea of what you need to put together your adventure.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.560]   So from the beginning, this was a plan? Did you bumble into it?
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.040]   Most people, if you said you retired in your early 30s, and you said it was a 10-year plan,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.440]   that would mean sometime in your early to mid 20s, you came up with the idea.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.960]   I've rarely met someone in the early mid 20s that's working towards early retirement. How did you come up with the idea?
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.640]   Well, there was some time when...
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.880]   Like the phase from basically graduating from college, paying off student loans,
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:14.360]   until the time when the plans started, I was pretty much a workaholic.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.840]   You know, I was doing
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.120]   60 plus hours a week,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   plus take home work and so on.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.480]   And the day, a time came when I had an opportunity to take my first adult vacation.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:37.400]   Three weeks long, the first week, I really just checked email, thought about work, exchanged email with people at work.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.040]   The second week, I started to think, "Hey, this is kind of nice."
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.360]   And by the end of week three, I was asking, "How can I do this every day for the rest of my life?"
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.680]   So I kind of went back home and
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.800]   started asking questions. "How much would it cost? How would I do it? Is this realistic?"
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.680]   I wrote sort of... It came out to be roughly like a 50-page
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.600]   business plan at that time of how to get there.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.120]   And I think if I were to go back and look at it right now, I would think, "Wow, I was a very naive person."
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.800]   Right.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   But it got me started.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.960]   And
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.640]   from there, it was very much an active process.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.520]   How do I save a greater and greater percentage of income? And how do I invest it?
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.960]   What about medical care? You know, just all the kind of the questions that people ask.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.160]   "Can I ever go back to work? What would that look like? How much money do I need?"
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.400]   Over that 10-year period, as the money accumulated, the knowledge accumulated as well.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.480]   Did you find any books or mentors or resources that were particularly helpful for you?
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.840]   Yeah, so there were a lot of different things I read. Pretty much if there was any book on personal finance
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.520]   that I saw in the library or whatever, I would pick it up.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.160]   You know, most of it wasn't very practical for somebody aiming at early retirement.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.480]   It's generic advice of somebody aiming for a 65-year-old retirement.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.640]   But there was a website, like Early Retirement Forum.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.160]   You know, the Boggleheads Forum.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:35.520]   You know, later, after we were already sort of financially independent, we see some great sites like Mr. Money Mustache,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.600]   Early Retirement Extreme,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.800]   JL Collins, NH.com.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.680]   Did...
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.600]   In kind of pursuing, it's interesting, with regard to the personal finance literature, that's always the...
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.760]   That's always kind of the trick that I found.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.520]   Because when I was younger, I consumed a lot of personal finance literature, and I thought, "Oh, I'm doing great.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.280]   I'm saving 15% of my income, obviously, so therefore I'm on track. I don't have any debt.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.320]   You know, I'm investing well, so therefore I'm on good shape."
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   I'm in good shape toward reaching my goals.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But sometimes I feel like I got a little gypped, because if I had found someone who'd give me the ideas, you know, if I had read
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.600]   Jacob Lund Fisker's book when I was in my teens, I would have saved 75 or 80 percent of my income.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:32.440]   And so I'm so glad that some of those resources are coming out now and are more and more prominent and are being more and more
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.040]   accepted. And then I feel like, "Man, what did I miss?"
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.520]   And somehow you got something that I didn't get 10 or 15 years ago, because we were both reading the same books, and somehow
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.560]   you had the goal and figured out how to make it happen, and I just didn't even think of it as being a possibility.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   Well, you know, we all come to it in our own way and in our own time.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.960]   You know, the question is, you know, are we able to kind of make the connection of how do you break away from the mainstream?
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   Right.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.760]   So you saved for 10 years. What percentage of your income? You figured out what percentage of your income you saved over that period of time?
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.360]   Yeah, it was...
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.160]   You know, in the beginning it was less, but
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.040]   we hit 70-ish percent in the later years, and then
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.720]   in hindsight, the last three years we were contributing 100 percent.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.320]   That's great.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.160]   I just kind of broke the
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:38.060]   financial independence barrier before we actually left, and so we were able to save every penny that came in for a few years.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.700]   So you followed Jacob's seven-year plan.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.660]   If you contributed 100 percent for the last three years, you did about the seven-year plan like he talks about.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.820]   How did you do it?
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:55.120]   Well, there are basically three pieces, right? Like, if you look at any of
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.300]   either like the US Census data or
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.860]   what is any analysis that looks at kind of average spending for people,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.260]   the three things that they spend the most money on are
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.820]   housing, transportation, and food, and
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.460]   we
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.700]   we didn't own a car.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   We basically
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.040]   very carefully found the place that we lived, which was a small apartment near a university.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.740]   We had all the great amenities nearby. We were a block from the grocery store, a block from the farmer's market, a couple blocks from a library,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.740]   a couple blocks from a park, so we could walk everywhere.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.300]   We were also on major
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:41.140]   public transportation routes for busing, so if we needed to get anywhere else, we could take a bus.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.900]   Then I started biking to work.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.620]   I had three different routes I could take.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.500]   There's somewhere between 8 and 23 miles one way, and
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.740]   you know, it's kind of, at first it wasn't that
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:02.940]   it took a while to become accustomed to it, but by the end, you know, if there's one thing I miss about
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.100]   having my job was that I had that daily bike ride.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:15.700]   And then, you know, now that we had basically our transportation costs way down and our housing costs way down,
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.940]   we started basically working through
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.900]   how do we spend as little money as possible on food.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.420]   And what we, you know, Winnie basically,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:34.660]   she picked a couple cookbooks, like a French cookbook and an Italian cookbook, and she just started working through them.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:41.460]   You know, the quality of the food that she prepared just got better and better, and eventually we're just like,
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.380]   why are we gonna go to a restaurant when the food we can have at home is of this quality?
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.180]   And when you get to that point where those three things basically become
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.100]   kind of a low percentage of your budget,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.820]   or a low percentage of your income, it becomes quite easy to save a large percentage of income.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:05.500]   I'm glad you bring out the food thing. I've observed if you look at most of the cuisines of at least
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.140]   ethnics,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.140]   excuse me, ethnicities or
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.100]   countries that are known for their cuisine, if you think about it,
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.060]   it's very likely that their cuisine was not just by the rich.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:23.220]   So the, you know, Italian cuisine or French cuisine or Chinese
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.020]   cuisine is not just because this is what the rich people ate.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.860]   This is probably what most of the people ate, and there is a cultural
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:39.940]   treasure in looking to see how did people eat in an affordable way. A loaf of wonderful French bread fresh out of the oven
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:47.220]   costs about 15 or 20 cents worth of ingredients to make, but you have to make it and you have to do it right to
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.700]   get the same experience. Or, you know, an Italian pasta dish, the pasta is not that expensive.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.700]   But learning how to spice it up comes with the skill.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:01.060]   So you can either go and buy it and hire somebody to cook for you, or you can learn to do it yourself and
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.780]   recreate with skill what most people would have to spend money on.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.580]   And you know Chinese eat the
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.780]   weird part of the meat, so it's really cheap. Right, right.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.460]   Well, you know, one of the popular posts on GoCurryCracker is
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.900]   about making bread.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.260]   You know, you can go buy this
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:30.500]   artisan loaf of bread at like the farmers market or a specialty market for six or seven dollars,
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.580]   or you make it home for a few pennies.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.260]   And we have a whole post about how
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.500]   we basically made this fantastic bread for
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.660]   a post of fruit.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.980]   Yeah, I'll have to check that out and read it. I haven't read that post of yours, but I had the same experience.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.740]   I read on, I was reading on some
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.900]   frugality blog and they were talking about how easy it was to make French bread. And they had the, I think it was French bread,
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.300]   and they had their ingredients and it was basically just flour, salt, and
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.900]   water, I guess, maybe a little bit of yeast or whatever it was. And that was it.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.180]   That was the whole ingredients. And I made I think four or five loaves and it was delicious,
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.180]   right out of the oven. And the cost was just pennies, absolute pennies.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.820]   So that's great. And Winnie, I like your point about the Chinese cuisine.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:20.340]   We also often forget about that in the US culture. One of the things, I haven't learned how to cook Chinese food,
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.420]   but I love to eat it. And one of the things that I enjoy, you guys are in China now, you're in Taiwan, right?
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.140]   Okay, so I haven't been to Taiwan, but I went to China one time.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.940]   We would go to the street markets and you see all of just these amazing,
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:39.940]   to me, weird foods. And you think, wow, you can eat that, you can eat that, you can eat that. And you see how,
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.220]   especially in Asian cuisine, you know, a lot of times the meat is chopped up very small.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.580]   So we're in the in the US, we'll have a steak for dinner and you need a big, nice cut of meat.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.340]   But if you're only using little bits of meat to flavor the dish,
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:59.700]   I mean, you can use the, you can use the jowls of the pig to be that meat source and stretch it a lot farther.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.020]   So that's a neat observation.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:10.980]   So once you left, do you have any plans to ever return to the US or you guys think we're gonna be international forever?
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.780]   No, we'll return to the US.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.020]   You know, we have a baby on the way.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.020]   Congratulations.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.020]   Thank you.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:28.420]   And one of the things that we would like to do is kind of RV around to all the national parks.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.100]   And so we'll be back in the US.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:37.940]   I don't know if that'll be like a permanent destination or just a trip that we do, but we'll be back.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.100]   So far, Central America and
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.460]   you also said Southeast Asia or Central America and then you flew straight to Taiwan.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.340]   Yeah, we flew straight to Taiwan.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.420]   So, you know, together
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.980]   we've been to about 40 different countries.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.060]   But we, you know, since I left work, we basically
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.900]   have been doing this very slow form of travel and I think we've been to like six or seven.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.340]   But Mexico for a long period,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.340]   Guatemala, Belize and then over to Taiwan.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.380]   What have you learned about how much it actually costs you to live this slow travel lifestyle?
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.060]   Well, it could cost a lot less than we pay now.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:30.020]   But we basically live a very luxurious lifestyle for about $3,000 a month.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:35.460]   You know, that includes everything.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:40.500]   And, you know, we sort of set up place.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500]   Set up, you know, we go to a new place.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.300]   If we like it, we'll find a longer term rental.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:52.860]   And then we usually get kind of immersed in the local culture, local
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.260]   you know, if there's something educational that we can study in that place, we'll do so.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.380]   So we studied Spanish, I'm studying Chinese.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.780]   When he's been studying oil painting.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.340]   And we just kind of we live there for a while.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.180]   And then when we're ready, we we go on to the next place.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.860]   And when you do kind of that, that live local,
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:19.180]   slow travel sort of style, it costs us less than what we were
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.940]   what we would pay for the equivalent in the US by far.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.180]   What do you think is the primary difference that drives the lower cost?
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.980]   Is it the cost of housing?
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.260]   Is it the cost of taxes?
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.700]   That what would you from living because you you came from Seattle, right?
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.740]   Yeah. So what would you say is the primary difference between why is it so expensive
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.740]   to live in the United States versus some of the other places that so far you've traveled?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:49.420]   Let's see here, you know, for the for the exact same thing,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.780]   everything costs more in the US.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.420]   So even even.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.100]   When we were in our heavy savings, when we were in our heavy saving mode,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.540]   we were we were spending only about three thousand dollars in Seattle, too.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.340]   We live a much, much, much more luxurious lifestyle now.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.300]   Like we literally eat two to three meals a day at restaurants every day.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.540]   But the the cost of real estate
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.100]   is much higher in the US, and so rent is higher.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.500]   And all the businesses paying rent like restaurants
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.820]   have to charge higher prices and the cost of labor is substantially higher.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.980]   And so those two things make make everything effectively more expensive.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.660]   Like in the in the US, people, people go for
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.900]   for businesses, go for massive scale to reduce costs.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.220]   Your Wal-Mart, your Costco, you know,
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:56.220]   in a lot of sort of Central America, Mexico, Taiwan,
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.820]   you have people go the other direction.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.660]   You know, it'll be an individual owned store
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.740]   where you'll see four generations of people hanging out and living in the shop.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.740]   And so a bowl of noodles is very cheap.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.740]   It's because grandma opened the business 40 years ago
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.580]   and the whole family is still running. Right.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:21.980]   I've wondered about this issue because my wife and I enjoy, enjoy traveling.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.340]   And to me, it seems like there's a bit of a nuance between it.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.620]   And it seems to me like the experience that you have of traveling in the US
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.100]   or traveling in another place will depend on the type of traveling that you're doing.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.460]   And it seems as though different regions of the world have different expenses.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.780]   And so the example that I think of is I think you're right about rental costs.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.820]   It seems if you come to the US and especially in a large city,
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.060]   your rental costs are higher.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.420]   You know, rental costs in New York City is dramatically different
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.700]   different than Chattanooga, Tennessee, or, you know,
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.060]   so you've got to deal with your regional preferences.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.780]   But so that is one thing.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.540]   But the other thing just seems to be labor costs.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.820]   So there are things in the US that are substantially cheaper than abroad.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.860]   In my observation, things like vehicles, most places in the world,
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:14.420]   even in places that are have a have a lower per capita income.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.860]   The cost of acquiring and maintaining a car is is is extremely high
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.740]   as compared to the cost of acquiring and maintaining a car in the United States.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.140]   Now, it's still a big expense, but it's it's you can get a good car
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:30.140]   for a few thousand bucks and the cost of of operating it is not not such a big deal.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.860]   But when you switch to things like labor intensive things,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.900]   the prices in restaurants would be a good example.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.660]   The labor costs are so high that I remember traveling in Hong Kong.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.020]   It seems like everybody in Hong Kong eats out two to three meals a day.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.740]   Nobody cooks because the cost of eating out is just extremely low,
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.300]   lower labor costs, and the kitchens are not set up in such a way that,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   you know, it's small, so it's a little harder to have this massive kitchen.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.700]   So if you're willing to adjust with the regional differences,
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.140]   then I think you could probably live a frugal and fulfilled life.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.660]   It wherever.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.260]   But the key would be knowing what's important to you and knowing,
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.300]   you know, hey, we're foodies, so the the beautiful restaurants to eat out,
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.220]   that's important to us.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.500]   So then we're going to pull back in another place.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.420]   So I'll be interested to continue watching your expenses as you as you continue
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.180]   traveling and see if they adjust or they change as you're in different regions.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.420]   I've noticed you've stayed out of Western Europe, for example.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.300]   Was that intentional or or you haven't gotten around to it yet?
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.300]   Yeah, we haven't gotten around to it, but it's conscious, right?
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.540]   People have to go through a mental, mental transition
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.860]   when they go from earning a paycheck to living off their investments.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:47.940]   And, you know, we we've saved enough where we could go to Western Europe,
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.500]   but we wanted to kind of make that,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.980]   you know, jumping off the ledge sort of thing.
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.300]   Right. As shallow as possible.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.540]   And so we started out in places that we knew were going to cost us.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.180]   And then we'll work our way over to to to Europe whenever we get there.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.540]   Right. And I think it's brilliant that you have that flexibility and
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.260]   that that can bring, you know,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.900]   especially as you get used to living off of a portfolio,
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.780]   there'll be fluctuations in the value of the portfolio as time goes on.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.860]   And it's certainly if you can adjust your expenses
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.540]   based upon your actual experience of your portfolio can make a huge difference.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.940]   And I think the same thing for all of us.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.140]   You know, tell my wife in our we're still in the accumulation phase of our lives.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.780]   We're not yet we're not yet financially independent.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.820]   But I talk with her and we just talk about
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.380]   there's no reason for us to cut back on the fun and the joy of life.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.780]   We you know, I don't know if I'll make it to 10 years from now,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.300]   but I don't have any desire to try to go into Scotland right now
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.940]   or go to the UK and and go to London.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.460]   We enjoy traveling in the less expensive parts of the world now.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.220]   And so we can still satisfy the desire for travel
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.380]   or the desire to experience new things.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.580]   And then later, as we accumulate more and more assets
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.060]   and it's a lot easier out of the surplus to go to the more expensive parts
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.020]   of the world, then I think that's when we'll start we'll start doing that.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.980]   So you've got an amazing amount of flexibility there.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.020]   And I think that's a really valuable financial strategy
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.220]   that we don't talk enough about.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.620]   You know, I I've been to I don't know exactly
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.060]   for some countries, not adventure, Western Europe.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:31.740]   But my my favorite places that I've been
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.100]   is one of them, you know, stand out is like Guatemala.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.700]   And it just so happens that it's also incredibly dirt cheap. Right.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.260]   It's just the quality of life there and the natural environment.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.780]   They're incredible. And I love it.
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.940]   Right. Paris is nice.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.900]   But if I were to choose like a long term place to live,
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.340]   I think I'd be more towards Guatemala than Paris.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.340]   Right. It's not not because of the pricing, just because of the quality of life.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:05.340]   Do you factor currency fluctuations into your planning at all at this point?
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.420]   I would assume that your portfolio being from the US
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.980]   is probably primarily denominated in US dollars.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.780]   Have you factored exchange rates and currency fluctuations
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.540]   into your planning at all?
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.660]   Not really.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.860]   Don't really worry about it.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:25.820]   Like when we spent, I don't know, almost nine months in Mexico last year.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:31.820]   And during that time, I think the peso fell against the dollar like 10 percent.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.020]   You know, so we were paying 10 percent more at the end of the trip
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.420]   than we were in the beginning.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.860]   But, you know, it's 10 percent of a pretty low number already.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.300]   So I don't really worry about it.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:48.340]   What strategy did you use as far as accumulating accounts?
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.660]   Did you and especially with retiring early, did you fund retirement accounts?
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.820]   Did you fund taxable accounts?
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.780]   Did you buy real estate?
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.020]   Did you buy mutual funds?
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:02.140]   What investment strategy did you pursue while working through to financial independence?
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.020]   All of that.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.900]   Good. Yeah.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.500]   And, you know, some of it better than others.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:17.540]   But if you're going to save enough, you know, basically 25 times your annual expenses,
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.900]   and less than 10 years, you have to use taxable accounts.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:29.700]   There's just the legal limits for how much you can put in tax deferred accounts
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.220]   preventing you from saving enough there.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:36.180]   And so I put money into 401K first.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:45.060]   We funded a HSA later when that became an options report.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.100]   And then it was everything into taxable accounts.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.740]   And so at this point, are you drawing down on your taxable accounts?
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.300]   Are you doing like a Roth conversion strategy?
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.220]   What are you doing right now for your tax planning?
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:08.180]   Yeah, so probably the most popular post on GoCurricular is never pay taxes again.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.500]   Walk us through that one.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:17.460]   Yeah, so there are basically four things that we do, four rules to follow,
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.540]   which I'm probably going to forget that right now.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.980]   But rule number one is be lazy.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:29.660]   Don't work for a living because there's basically social security taxes and such.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.780]   There's no way to avoid those when you're working.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:40.300]   Then somewhere in there, there's live well for less.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.060]   We don't own a car.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.900]   We don't own a 3,000 square foot house with an ocean view.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:53.780]   But we live very well on much less than what it would cost to own those things.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:59.780]   And by keeping your annual spending low and therefore your required income low,
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.620]   you are able to pay next to nothing in taxes.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:10.620]   And then we try to live primarily off of dividends and long-term capital gains
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:16.140]   because it's like the US government wants you to retire early and live off of those
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.100]   forms of investments.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:23.540]   So you effectively pay zero tax when you're able to live on less than like
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.780]   $70,000 a year or so as a married couple.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:34.660]   So we basically then follow those three things.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:40.540]   And then we try to minimize future taxes by following two strategies, and that's
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.100]   Roth IRA conversions.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:49.980]   So we're taking my 401(k) and then slowly converting that into a Roth IRA.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:29:00.940]   Because our sort of earned income is so low, we're allowed to roll over up to $20k
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:07.660]   total a year in total money from the IRA into a Roth at zero tax.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.540]   And then that money will be later taken out tax-free.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.980]   And then we also harvest capital gains.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:22.820]   So last year I sold something like a $40,000 gain and then invested it
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.500]   immediately in another fund.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.020]   And that 40k was effectively tax-free as well and not tax-free forever.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:35.100]   How did you learn about tax planning?
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.100]   I did my own taxes for a decade.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:50.820]   And there are great tools like you can pay somebody an accountant $300 to do
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.420]   your taxes.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:56.220]   And they'll give you a bill that you owe this much or you get this much of a
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:56.620]   refund.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.300]   And they'll give you some advice.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.540]   Usually probably buy a house.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.660]   And you'll never learn anything.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.340]   You can use a tool like TurboTax.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.540]   And it'll walk you through.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.980]   It'll ask you some questions and give you some clues.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.380]   But again, you probably won't learn very much.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:21.140]   When you get down and actually go through all the forms yourself by hand and read
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:28.260]   the instructions and follow the documents that the instructions refer to, you start
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:34.900]   to really figure out, wait a second, if I modify what I'm doing here in this way,
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.660]   then this becomes tax-free.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:41.140]   Or if I do this other thing, I can get a tax refund.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:47.380]   And when you build up the knowledge over a long period of time, like doing my
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.700]   taxes for 10 years, it always became clear.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:58.020]   And then some of the ideas in general, I paid attention to the Bobbohead
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.260]   Tax Forum.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:05.140]   And through there, people ask, kind of beginner investors, they'll ask questions.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.580]   And I love seeing beginner questions because when you're old and crotchety like
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.100]   me, you kind of assume you know a lot of things.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.380]   And then when you see it through the beginner's eyes, you realize you didn't
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.620]   know very much at all.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.420]   And some of those questions kind of pointed me to it.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.220]   Wait a second.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:27.980]   If I sell a stock with a big gain and not have to pay any tax on it, and then I
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:35.220]   buy something similar on the same day, I've effectively harvested that gain
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.340]   forever.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.700]   I never would have thought that without having seen it on the forum.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.460]   - Right.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.820]   And I want to add one point, and I'm sure you could make this point, but it's
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.220]   something I've often heard, is that people often, when you describe tax gain
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:53.860]   harvesting, oftentimes people say, "Well, doesn't that run afoul of the wash sale
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.620]   rule?"
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:59.700]   And there's a rule colloquially known as the wash sale rule, which basically means
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.180]   that if you have a loss on an investment, you can't sell it and then purchase in
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:10.140]   order to take the loss and then purchase the same investment, either the identical
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:16.820]   or the substantially equivalent investment, in order to take that loss.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.460]   But the key that people often forget about is that only applies to losses.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.660]   So at any point in time, you can go ahead and lock in a gain.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.100]   And one of the major misconceptions that I see happening right now among tax
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.660]   planning is that everyone's so excited about harvesting tax losses, saying, "Okay,
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.740]   here's how we can figure out how to harvest these losses."
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.020]   But the problem is that every time you harvest a loss, in some ways, you're
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.740]   building up a higher deferred gain.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:49.060]   And so effective tax planning is about moderating that gain, taking your losses
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.260]   when you're able to take them in a way that makes sense, but also ratcheting up
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.940]   those gains to increase your cost basis.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.620]   So if you can increase your cost basis by selling the investment, taking the gain,
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.980]   recognizing it for tax purposes, and then buying exactly the same investment, if
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.980]   you're able to control that, you can wipe out a massive amount of your tax liability
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.060]   by doing it intelligently.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.100]   But it's not something that really someone else can do for you because
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.660]   everything is based upon what do you need, what are your spending, what is your
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.700]   limits, and those will change every year based upon what your income is and what
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.340]   the makeup of your income is.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.900]   So I'm glad to hear you correcting that and talking about that for people.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.540]   - And that's where doing taxes takes me a couple hours.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.140]   I try to do them before the end of the year.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:43.780]   So rather than April 15th, 2015, I'll do our taxes in December of this year.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.940]   And then I know what to do with the portfolio at the end of the year.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:58.980]   But technically, there is a rule that if you sell a stock or a fund, harvest the
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:07.980]   gain, and then immediately buy back the exact same fund, technically, the IRS does
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:16.220]   have a rule that if you're performing an action specifically for the purpose of
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:24.340]   impacting your taxes, they could decide through a review that they think that
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.660]   that action can be wiped out.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:34.860]   As far as I know, it's never been done for tax gain harvesting, but I try to avoid,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.820]   say, buying and selling the exact same fund on the same day.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:46.940]   But the way to kind of work your way around that is if you buy, say, like an
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:52.380]   index tracking fund, and it just happens to track a different index, so you could,
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:58.820]   say, sell an S&P 500 fund and then buy something that tracks, like, small stock
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:05.820]   index or something, and that is considered a substantially different invest.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:12.220]   If you were to say, sell Berkshire Hathaway, harvest the gain, and buy Berkshire
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:18.500]   Hathaway the same day, the IRS could get a stick up their butt.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.380]   You're referring to the substance over form doctrine that any transaction that's
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.260]   specifically for the purpose of tax planning, technically, they're going to look
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.140]   at what's the actual substance of the transaction, not just what was the form of
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.140]   the transaction, right?
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.140]   That sounds correct.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   I'm not sure exactly what they're calling it anymore.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.700]   Sorry, I'm throwing financial planner lingo in.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.860]   That's what the doctrine is that I'm aware of.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:50.140]   I'm not aware of a wash—I could be mistaken, so if I'm mistaken, somebody can
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.060]   let us know in the comments.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:36:00.940]   But you are 100% correct, is that there is a doctrine that basically says that all tax
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.220]   rules are bound by what is the economic substance of a transaction, even if that actual
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.700]   substance varies a little bit from the legal form.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:15.140]   If listeners are interested, check out episode 41, radicalpersonalfinance.com/41,
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.580]   and I mention that doctrine in there and kind of go into it a little bit in detail.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.580]   But you are right.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:25.020]   I think that's an important point to keep in mind, is that you always want to be
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:30.100]   careful to avoid some of those pitfalls with tax planning.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:35.700]   It's so easy to avoid just by doing something that's slightly different, and you
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:43.740]   have your evidence illustrating your point.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:49.500]   You released on your site your 2013 tax return equivalently, basically, right?
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.300]   Yeah, I put our 2013 1040 out there.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:01.940]   It's just something effective, like 90-some thousand dollars in just gross income and
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.940]   zero tax.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.820]   So I'm going to repeat that again, because over the connection it was just a little
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:15.180]   crackled, 90-something thousand dollars of gross income and zero dollars of tax.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.420]   That is correct.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   How did you do it?
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:30.620]   It actually, the principles I mentioned, I don't have a job, so there's no social security
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.620]   tax.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:39.140]   We get most of our income from dividend and long-term capital gains.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.780]   So those are for our level of income taxed at zero percent.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:54.740]   And because our income is considered low, about $60,000 of maybe $60,000 of that $90,000
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:00.020]   of imaginary income, it was harvested from a long-term capital gain, and it was doing
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.900]   the Roth IRA conversion.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:10.580]   So I created income on paper that was effectively just moving money around that we found existed.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.580]   But it eliminated future tax.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.580]   It reduced our future tax.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:24.900]   And it's just a $90,000 number, it's just roughly what you can legally earn from investment
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:30.820]   income when still considered bad, like future tax.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   I think it's awesome.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.420]   And I'm so glad you put the actual return up so that people could see how it works.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:41.300]   And if you can control your expenses, there's a huge, huge opportunity.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.140]   I love the early retirement financial independence community, because one of the key components
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:53.020]   of this community is having control over expenses and learning how to live well for less.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:58.580]   And one of the things that's ironic about the way that U.S. income taxes work is that
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.380]   you are penalized for productivity.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.940]   And it's not really a political statement, although I don't mind getting into politics.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.100]   It's just simply a fact, is that the more productive you are, because we tax income,
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.620]   the more productive that you are, the more your penalty is.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.500]   The more productive that somebody is at creating income, the higher the tax rates, the higher
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.940]   the tax base, the higher the total amount of tax.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:29.540]   And we, as a society, we've decided that that is morally just to have that type of
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540]   income tax system.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.340]   It's not the system that I would choose, but that's what we as a society have decided.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:40.900]   But what it opens up is that because everything is based upon this class warfare, this idea
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.100]   of, well, we're supposed to penalize the rich, and then the middle class, we're supposed
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.140]   to give everything to the middle class, there's kind of a sweet spot.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.980]   And you've hit it exactly with your expenses.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.340]   If you can control your expenses to a moderate amount, and you can increase your income to
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:00.940]   a substantial level, you can avoid a massive amount of tax, but not if you need the income
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.100]   for consumption.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.580]   I was having a conversation with an early retiree the other day, and I was illustrating
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.260]   how this person doesn't need a substantial amount of income from their income.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:18.860]   And I was showing them how they can shelter basically $100,000 in tax-deferred accounts,
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:24.820]   and then how they could pursue some strategies to shelter their money going forward.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.500]   But all of that is based upon not needing the money to spend now.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.140]   If you need the money to spend now, this is where you're in the worst possible situation.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.300]   If you need to spend the money now on lifestyle, then that means you need to earn it.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.220]   And so the high earners and the high spenders are the ones who pay a massive amount of the
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.500]   tax.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.860]   But what I love about your return and your story is you're illustrating how you can
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:57.300]   get good tax planning on your side, and it can massively increase your time scale.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.900]   So I thank you for working so hard.
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.060]   It's not easy to put numbers out there.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.860]   It's not easy to work through the detailed definition.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   I thank you for putting the information out there for people.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   I want to express my apologies and stuff aside.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:18.540]   But the main thing is what it all comes down to, where everything comes from, is just being
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:24.300]   able to live what you consider a wonderful life, something that you're more than happy
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.700]   with for very little money.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:32.340]   And most of that is just what you've become accustomed to and how you choose to do the
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:39.340]   things you love.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:47.620]   And 99% of people in the United States, that's like saying I hate baseball and apple pie,
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   which I kind of do.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.620]   Me too.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   But when I was living in Seattle, I wanted to go do anything.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.340]   I wanted to go get some ice cream at the grocery store.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.340]   Most people, okay, well, I'll walk up to the garage, start the car, I'll drive 10 minutes
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.940]   to the grocery store, find a parking space, walk inside, oh crap, I've got to get some
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.940]   gas, so I'll stop at the gas station and go home.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:25.740]   And they do that whole 40 minute journey, and the oil light comes on, and I'm like,
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.540]   oh, that's right, I need to change the oil, I'll schedule that, and it all goes off.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:35.340]   I walk downstairs across the street, start the car, and go back home, and that's five
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.340]   minutes.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.940]   And by designing life to not have the car, it will just hit on the car.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.500]   My life kicks ass, because I never have to get in the car, I never have to park, I never
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.900]   have to get gas, I never have to change the oil, I never have to change all that baggage
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   that comes with owning something.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.900]   I just naturally do it.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:43:02.620]   It's a powerful concept, because a lot of times what happens, especially in our society,
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:08.860]   is that we don't necessarily consciously choose, and certain things are sewn into us and put
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.800]   into us by other people, usually unintentionally, I think.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.900]   But for example, in the United States, we have a car culture, a car-centric culture.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.940]   So if you're a young person, it's often, usually, maybe it's your father.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.700]   A lot of times your father admires a nice car, and if your father admires a nice car,
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:29.020]   then you want to emulate your father, and so you naturally take on that desire and that
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.260]   attraction for cars.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:38.660]   And that may be for a beautiful, fast BMW M5, or it may be for a big, giant four-wheel
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:45.740]   drive pickup truck with mud tires, or it may be a sleek, fast, imported Honda racing car,
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.580]   or whatever it is.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:54.260]   What happens is that oftentimes we don't fully grasp, at a young age, we don't fully grasp
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.360]   the impact of certain things that we feed.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.580]   So we feed that appetite.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.020]   When I was a kid, I fed the appetite with magazines, car magazines, and four-wheeler
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:06.300]   magazines, and as we feed that appetite, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows,
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.220]   and then we feel like, "Well, this is what I've got to do to be happy," or whether it's
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:15.500]   things like boats, or whether it's things like any hobby or something that we feed.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.900]   And me personally, I would like to leave every person free to live their life as they want,
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.220]   but I've found that if I actually look and do some self-examination and understand why
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:31.540]   is it that I'm so committed to this love of the car, where does this come from?
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.520]   It wasn't something that I actually went and chose and said, "This would serve me and serve
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.380]   my goals and be beneficial to me."
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.740]   It's largely something that's influenced into me.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.580]   And so by rejecting that and seeing that, "You know what?
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.220]   I'd rather have the free time to not have to deal with—I was dealing with fixing my
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.180]   car this weekend, and I'd rather have the free time to not have to deal with the car,
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:55.340]   and I'd rather just take a taxi when I need one and ride the bus and walk," if you can
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.820]   set your lifestyle up on that, it's powerful because you can take back control.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:04.460]   And that taking back control leads, I believe, to taking back control in every area and leads
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.980]   to long-term goal achievement.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.980]   Don't forget the bicycle.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   Right.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.980]   I forgot.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   My bicycle was stolen a few months ago and I haven't gotten around to buying a new one,
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.300]   so I forgot about the bicycle.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.180]   I need to get another one.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:23.300]   On the car thing, I'm kind of—I have a cool new one in my family.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.780]   My mom has five brothers, four of them in the appendix, my grandfather was in the appendix,
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.860]   and I had a bunch of—you know, the four mustangs that they had souped up and everything,
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.860]   and they rode motorcycles, whatever.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:38.080]   I remember—well, I don't remember, my father told me many years later, but sometime when
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.700]   I was 12 or so, he was changing the rail and he was like, "Hey, I'm going to teach you
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:48.580]   to change the rail today," and I said something like, "Dad, when I'm older, I'll pay somebody
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.580]   to do that."
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:54.740]   And so I was the only person, like, the whole time in anywhere that doesn't know how to
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.580]   change the rail.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.140]   I used to have the same exact thought, and I regret it now because I didn't learn the
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.380]   skills that I needed to learn, and I've had to, as an adult, go back and say, "Why was
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.380]   I such a dumb-dumb?
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.060]   Now I need to learn those skills."
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.220]   But I don't think there—one comment on the car thing.
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.380]   I don't think that—these things are not mutually exclusive, meaning that you don't
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:24.180]   have to walk away from an enjoyment of automobiles just to retire early.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:30.660]   An example that would occur to me is I think that very few people necessarily love commuting.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:35.540]   So you can implement the lifestyle that you've talked about where you don't need to drive
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:41.540]   a four-door sedan every day and still indulge in enjoyment of cars, but if you'll free
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.180]   up the money that you spend on the four-door sedan that you destroy every day with an hour
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:50.420]   on the road commuting, and if you can make an adjustment there, that can open up the
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.100]   kind of thing where you can take a trip to Europe and you can rent a beautiful brand
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:02.020]   new BMW M5 or M6 or whatever they're on these days, a fast car, and you can rent it
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:07.820]   and you can enjoy the Autobahn, or you can go and you can lease a beautiful—you go
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:12.140]   to Spain and you can lease a beautiful Aston Martin or Ferrari for a month.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:16.740]   And the cost of doing those things is really not so significant when they're done for
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.380]   a temporary period of time.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.940]   So go and lease a Ferrari for a week or for a month or something like that and get that
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.940]   experience.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.980]   But the majority of middle-class people will never get there because they're destroying
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:32.940]   their money with the four-door sedan that we put 30,000 miles a year on to cover our
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   commute.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.940]   They're not incompatible.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:42.940]   When it comes back to—I try to follow the philosophy, "There's no one right way
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.940]   to live."
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:44.940]   So spend your money however you like.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.940]   Everybody has those choices.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:53.660]   I don't think there's any way that's better than the other.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:00.340]   But if early retirement is your goal, then saving upwards of 70% of your income is the
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.660]   goal.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:11.580]   And if you can save a lot and have a car, then fantastic.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.780]   Maybe you'll spend less money somewhere else.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.020]   But we do spend more on food.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.460]   Maybe you'll spend less on food and more on car.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.020]   We both got there.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   >> Right.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.020]   Absolutely.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.620]   So let's switch gears.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.620]   And the other thing that you've been writing recently about on your blog, which is of great
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.020]   interest of mine, is about medical costs.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:39.780]   And when I've talked with people who are—whether that's traditional retirement, the 60, 65
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:44.860]   age retirement, or whether that's early retirement, one of the major fears that people have is
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.300]   how to handle any potential healthcare costs.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.900]   What has been your experience since retiring?
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.620]   And what have you practically done, for example, with health insurance coverage, things like
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.620]   that?
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.580]   And what has been your experience with handling that?
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:07.540]   Because I know you've recently had some pretty significant medical events going on.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:16.140]   >> Yeah, so when we left the US two years ago, we purchased a high deductible health
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.180]   plan.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:25.300]   And we paid the premium on that for like 11 months, and then we got rid of it.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   And we went to the dentist in Mexico.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.420]   I went to the doctor in Mexico.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.060]   Let's see here.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.420]   We both went to the doctor in Taiwan.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:46.260]   And then we went through a whole process of in vitro fertilization here in Taiwan.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:51.020]   So that's how we're going to have the baby.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.860]   All of that, everything, we just paid cash.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:50:03.660]   And just as a kind of interesting thing, have you or do you know anybody who's been to the
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.380]   emergency room in the US recently?
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.740]   >> I just had some friends go there recently.
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.820]   A three-day hospital stay just last night, was talking with a friend last night.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.620]   Three-day hospital stay, went to the emergency room, wound up being appendicitis.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:23.020]   The hospital bill was $81,000.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:31.660]   >> So we went to the emergency room the other night, saw the doctor, had a couple tests,
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.500]   left after about an hour.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:39.220]   The total bill, $30.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:48.620]   So when a system is set up in such a way that you can't know the prices in advance, you
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:54.900]   can't compare prices between places, and you don't get a bill for like two weeks to six
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:59.260]   months later because of all the processing through the different insurance systems and
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:10.420]   that, you end up with a bill like $81,000 for whatever the case was.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.620]   In Taiwan at least, it's a single payer healthcare system.
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:18.340]   I can ask in advance, how much am I going to have to pay for this?
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:23.940]   I pay in advance for the procedure, and I can make decisions, like is that worth it
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:24.940]   or not?
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:33.420]   With all that transparency, it just effectively comes out to be a more efficient system, $30.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   >> Wow.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:41.100]   The strange thing about it is that $81,000 bill, my friend was looking at what the insurance
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.540]   company actually paid.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:48.520]   So $81,000 was what was billed, but the negotiated rate for the insurance company that they actually
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.300]   paid was $10,000.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:56.340]   So you have this just nuts differential between these things, and that's what makes it so
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.300]   confusing and so complicated.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:03.740]   How much did your dental work in Mexico cost, and how much is the in vitro fertilization
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.140]   process in Taiwan costing you?
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.380]   >> So let's see here.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:18.740]   I don't remember what the dental trip in Mexico 500 pieces was, so like 35 bucks, something
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.740]   like that.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:29.500]   And then I went to, I had like a high fever and stuff, and I kind of knew I had bronchitis,
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:35.780]   and I went to the doctor in Mexico, and I think it was three bucks.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.540]   But then of course I had to pay for the prescription, right?
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:44.420]   Which you know, some antibiotics, and I think that was like $8.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:49.300]   So they get you on the way out is basically how they get you, right?
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.420]   Three bucks for the doctor, eight bucks for the pills.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.420]   And yeah, go ahead.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.700]   >> I was going to say, how about the IVF?
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:04.300]   >> So we kind of chose Taiwan for that by doing some cost research, and then Winnie's
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:09.540]   from here, so we kind of get the double bonus of being able to see family and whatnot while
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.820]   we're here.
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:18.500]   I think the online calculator that I used for estimating the US price was something like
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.020]   $35,000 it would have cost us.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:27.340]   And in Taiwan that cost us about seven.
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.900]   >> Is your sense that that is because of the general subsidy, meaning that the general
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:38.980]   taxpayer, the tax base and the general tax that's being collected is being distributed,
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.940]   and so therefore the cost is lower in that way?
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:45.820]   Or is it generally, do you feel, in your experience, do you feel it's more just the cost of the
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.940]   care is lower, the actual cost is lower?
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:52.740]   >> I think it's the cost of the care is lower, right?
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:54:00.180]   Because we're effectively operating outside of the subsidized system.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:06.220]   If I had Taiwan-based insurance, I would be inside the national health plan.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:11.700]   We basically, like, "Hey, you're the white guy.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:12.700]   Come talk to us over here.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.020]   Okay, this is what it's going to cost.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.820]   You need to pay in advance.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.460]   You need to pay cash."
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.460]   Okay.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:27.980]   As part of the process, I had to get a chest x-ray and an EKG and stuff because I had to
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:32.620]   go under anesthesia for part of the process.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:37.900]   And just that portion of chest x-ray, EKG, I walk in.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.260]   It takes like 10 seconds to do both of those things individually.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:45.620]   There's a nurse waiting there to run the x-ray machine and another nurse ready to run the
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.620]   EKG.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.620]   Go back to the doctor.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.300]   He's already got the results on his computer.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.060]   And they're like, "Okay, you're healthy enough to go under anesthesia.
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.820]   Just leave them off."
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:58.580]   I walk downstairs, hit the box or something like that.
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:54:59.580]   >> Wow.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:05.020]   It's definitely something I'm slow to talk much about, health insurance and healthcare
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.020]   systems.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:11.100]   And I studied for a financial planning designation called a registered health underwriter designation
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:16.380]   and as part of that, I read this like about a 500-page textbook on the history of the
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.900]   healthcare industry in the United States and the managed healthcare industry.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:28.740]   And what it opened up to me was how many moving parts there are and what a complicated situation
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.820]   it is.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.940]   And so at this point, I've kind of--you know, I have my own opinions about how I would like
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.220]   to live but I've kind of set aside any of my opinions for the general public and just
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.780]   said, "Well, here's how--let me just look for the ways that I can work my way through
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   the system."
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:48.900]   And I think that medical tourism is a tremendous--is a tremendous opportunity.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:55.420]   And as I've worked with a couple of people who are setting up destination medical tourist
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:56:00.580]   facilities in Central America and I think that, you know, people will often get--when
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:04.380]   they have a serious--when they need something, it's not uncommon for people who with the
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.980]   means to get on an airplane and go to another city where there's a well-known health clinic.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.940]   And in a world where I can get on an airplane and be in Costa Rica or be in Nicaragua or
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.340]   be in Guatemala in two or three hours, it's really no different for me doing that versus
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.980]   flying to Cleveland.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:23.260]   But yet if the cost can be massively lower, it's certainly worth pursuing.
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.420]   >> I agree.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:33.340]   >> So as far as last kind of thought I had, last question that I was curious about and
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.420]   then any of the--and you can share anything else that you would like to share.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.700]   But have you thought about--now that you're expecting a baby, have you thought about doing
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:47.780]   any kind of fun like international arbitrage with your future son or daughter as far as
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.180]   where they're born and citizenship and some of those--some of the fun things that you
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.180]   could do?
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.220]   Do you plan to have a baby abroad in Taiwan for Taiwanese citizenship?
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.020]   Have you researched any of that stuff yet?
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:05.580]   >> Well, it'll have US and Taiwanese citizenship just through parents.
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:06.580]   >> Okay.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.580]   >> Neat.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:13.740]   >> But we had talked about trying to get, you know, if it would make sense to have another
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:17.100]   passport and that's another citizenship.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:23.300]   And it turns out that there just aren't very many countries anymore that give citizenship
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.300]   on birth.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:33.980]   You know, the--let's see here, Australia and New Zealand did up until about 10 years ago.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:39.740]   Most of Europe has basically changed their laws and so just by being born there, you
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.860]   don't get citizenship.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:47.260]   And then--so you're kind of looking at like Mexico, the US and Canada, probably the three
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.980]   biggest countries that still have that option.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:54.900]   Well, we were thinking originally, like it'd be great to say have like a baby in Spain,
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.460]   Italy, you know, get the EU passport.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:02.980]   Our child could work across Europe later if they chose to, you know, or a commonwealth
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:09.540]   passport from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UK, and then have the option to work across
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.540]   the commonwealth.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.660]   But neither of those options really look viable anymore.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.660]   But I still have to do it.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.660]   >> Interesting.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.660]   >> A destination birth still might be an option.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.660]   >> Interesting.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.220]   It's such an interesting just thing to think about.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.380]   It really is.
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:30.860]   When you are free of the need to be in one specific place, it opens up a world of possibilities
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.900]   that frankly I never considered when I was younger.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.660]   And my wife and I talked about that with our--we have a one-year-old son and we talked about
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.660]   that a little bit.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.660]   But, you know, I just thought through it and it wasn't appropriate for our lifestyle at
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.300]   that time but with your kind of traveling lifestyle at the moment.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:52.820]   But at any rate, Taiwanese citizenship and it sounds like you'll both be--your wife is
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.140]   multilingual and it sounds like you are working on it if you're studying Chinese.
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.940]   That'll be a tremendous advantage for your child as well.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:00.940]   >> That's right.
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.300]   >> Anything else?
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.460]   If you were going to--let's close with this.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:11.900]   If you were going to give an exhortation, an encouragement and a little bit of inspiration
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:18.460]   to other people who are interested in following a similar path to early retirement and who
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:24.980]   are interested in pursuing a similar lifestyle to the one that you've created, what would
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:28.460]   you share with others who are working on that path?
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:37.380]   >> So, it's a lot easier and a lot faster than most people think.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:46.060]   If you're accustomed to save 10% retire at 65 by making a few relatively minor adjustments
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:52.260]   to life, learning to love your bicycle, learning to cook great food at home and learning to
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:57.300]   be happy in a smaller space where you can walk everywhere instead of driving a car.
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:05.340]   You can get there in just a few short years and then everything in the world effectively
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.700]   opens up to you.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:16.060]   So the rewards of spending a little less now give you the world.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.060]   >> Well said.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.500]   Thank you for the work that you do on your blog which is gocurrycracker.com.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.020]   I appreciate it because I know it's not--it would probably be easier and more fun to not
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:30.700]   have to write on a blog but it's a valuable source of information and inspiration to other
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:35.940]   people and I thank you for putting so much work into it because it really will help many,
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:40.860]   many, many people uncover the strategies and the ideas and have the encouragement as they
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.460]   walk through their path to be able to achieve it.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:48.140]   What is--I forgot to ask you this.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:53.100]   Where does Go Curry Cracker come from?
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:59.820]   >> So for our honeymoon, I think we spent about $0.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:02.620]   We went on a--what was it?
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:09.820]   A 100-mile hike around Mount Rainier outside Seattle.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.580]   You carry all your own food.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.260]   You shower by plunging into some glacial runoff.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:21.100]   >> You cry every night.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:28.860]   >> You cry every night.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.860]   It's not easy every day.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:35.480]   You're hiking 10 miles a day up massive elevation gains and whatnot.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:46.460]   We had these little curry crackers that Winnie had handmade with love and care.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.420]   One day in a moment of delirium and frustration, we were trying to find some motivation and
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:59.460]   we looked at each other and said something like, "Go, go, go, curry cracker."
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:06.740]   That's kind of been--anytime that we need a moment of motivation or something to basically
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:11.820]   say, "Hey, we can accomplish this and go forward," that's what we'll say to each other.
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:18.220]   It'll just kind of bring us back and give us a little laugh and push us forward again.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.220]   >> It's a memorable name.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.220]   It's a memorable name.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.420]   I wanted to make sure we included that.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.700]   Winnie, I feel like I neglected you.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   I apologize.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:30.260]   Is there something that--would you like to share as we close here?
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.240]   Would you like to share a bit of encouragement and inspiration for those who are listening
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   from your perspective?
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   >> I think Matt has been talked about already.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:47.240]   I just took a few pills so I feel a little dizzy tonight.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   >> Understood.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.200]   >> I just passed your bedtime.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.120]   >> The kind of work that you guys have done and to stay together and to commit to your
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.800]   goals does not happen unless you are united in it.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:09.840]   It has to be a team effort because if one spouse says, "We're going to go live on a
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.800]   sailboat or live in a tent in the woods," and the other spouse says, "No, I want to
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.360]   own a boat, but that's just for the weekends and why can't we have a big house?"
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.840]   The whole plan falls apart.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.840]   >> That's why you need an obedient Asian wife.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840]   >> Excuse me.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.200]   I didn't quite hear that.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.200]   Say that again, please.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.200]   >> That's why you need an obedient Asian wife.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.200]   >> Right.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.760]   I think I got a feeling that there's a little bit of a tongue in cheek there.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.760]   Can I?
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.760]   I want to refund that.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.400]   I don't think that was in the contract at the beginning.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.920]   Or it was in the contract maybe at the beginning, but I don't think you can follow it.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.880]   >> Did you guys learn something as far as going through that?
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.040]   How did you, Jeremy, was it your idea originally, your wife's idea?
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.720]   How did you talk together?
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.240]   I wish maybe we'd ... Let's explore that real quick.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.480]   How did you talk together and learn how to be on the same page?
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.000]   What was the process?
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.840]   >> About the early retirement and travel?
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   That's a good question.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   Travel?
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:34.320]   If you look back at our individual goals from before we met, seeing the world was one of
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.440]   them that we shared and shared strongly.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:50.200]   We both grew up in relatively low income environments and never really felt the need to strive for
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.200]   consumer items and so on.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:05:02.720]   So not having things that people consider needs, we just never really missed them.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.920]   When income started rising, we were able to be like, "Hey, would I rather buy a blender
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.320]   or go live in Thailand for a year?"
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.440]   There was no question.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.080]   It wasn't ever really a long conversation.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:24.400]   It was just like, "Well, obviously this is what we should do."
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.720]   >> Interesting.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.360]   It certainly is a challenge.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:35.640]   I've heard from various readers and I've seen in forums and things like that, "How do I
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.480]   get my spouse on board with this idea?"
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.080]   So it's good to hear that you guys were naturally aligned.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.640]   I think that can make a lot of difference.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:06:01.400]   That goes back to if we didn't click on those things early on, we wouldn't be together.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.720]   We were living in two different countries, speaking two different native languages and
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   different cultures.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   >> Maybe that's why we get along.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   I don't understand what you're saying.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:16.000]   >> When I said, "Hey, do you want to live frugally and travel the world?"
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.040]   You were like, "I don't understand that."
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   I thought you said yes.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.840]   >> You confused the language.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.840]   I like it.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.720]   Thank you guys so much for coming on.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.280]   I appreciate you making the time.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.000]   I thank you for the insight and I thank you for the work that you're doing.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   >> Thank you, Joshua.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   I appreciate it.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.880]   >> Normal people, extraordinary results.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:48.960]   Anything in their story that you or I couldn't do?
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.960]   Probably nothing.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.160]   I didn't ask him exactly how much they were making.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:59.160]   I know that they're professionals, but you and I could learn to do that.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:06.880]   Notice the guild, as Jacob Lundfisker and I figured out is a good word for it, using
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.920]   a permaculture word of guild, is a good word for it to apply to financial planning.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:17.840]   Notice the trio of things, like he said, focusing on the biggest expenses, housing, transportation,
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.840]   and food.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.840]   So what do you do?
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.840]   Number one, housing.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:26.280]   Try to find the least expensive housing option that is satisfactory for your needs.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.880]   If your needs are simple, then your solution that satisfies those will be simpler.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.140]   Think about it.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:38.880]   Not enough people think about and locate their housing strategically.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:44.920]   Because we live in such an automobile-centric culture, we're accustomed to just driving
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   anywhere.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.120]   So that's why we have miles and miles of suburbs around every large city.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.100]   It's almost impossible when you live in the suburbs to not have a car.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:56.400]   But if you're willing to do as they did and live in the city, live in an apartment, you
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.640]   can be strategic about it.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.460]   You can get yourself close to shopping, restaurants, grocery stores, libraries.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:08.600]   You can get yourself close to a main transit terminal, so where you're quickly on that
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.360]   main transit terminal.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.480]   And especially if you're in a city where that's not so popular, I think you could do it anywhere.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.600]   But there are some cities where, in the US and around the world, where people are much
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:25.600]   more tuned in to those ideas of, "How do I figure out a strategic location for my business,
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.120]   excuse me, for my house?"
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.160]   Maybe more difficult.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.000]   But there are many cities in which you could exploit that.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.640]   And it's cheaper to, if you can get rid of, so A, if you can get a good housing cost,
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.200]   low cost, small amount of stuff, inexpensive apartment.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:45.520]   B, if you can reduce or eliminate your transportation costs, that will free up so much money.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.880]   And then as I said, if you can reduce or eliminate your food, you can't eliminate your food costs,
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.880]   excuse me.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:56.080]   If you can reduce and right size your food costs, that can make a major difference.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.600]   And sometimes that stuff can free up so much money for you to pursue other things that
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.960]   are important.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   Choose consciously.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.880]   If you want a big house in the suburbs, go for it.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.120]   If you want a big house on the water and a big four-wheel drive pickup truck, fine.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.200]   But notice what your options are and make sure that you're going in knowing that my
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:20.080]   opportunity cost for this money is fill in the blank for what's right for you.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.600]   I love to hear stories like that because it just illustrates how doable so many things
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.600]   are.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.680]   And your results will vary depending on how hardcore you are.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:32.840]   If you make more money than they did and spend less, you could do it faster.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.120]   If you make less money and spend more, it doesn't mean you can't do it.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.000]   You're just going to do it slower.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.160]   Custom design your own plan that will work for you.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.360]   Consider also the medical tourism ideas.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.840]   I'm not an expert on that area.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.840]   I've read a couple of books on it, but some books from the library about people who have
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   written about it.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.960]   But I got a feeling that stuff changes so much.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.520]   I'd love to know if you know somebody who's an expert on medical tourism, I'd love to
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.600]   interview one.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.360]   I don't know who to interview at this point.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.440]   But if you know somebody that you've read, maybe they have a blog or a business in that
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.080]   market or they're really an expert, shoot me a note, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080]   and let me know who they are.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.880]   Or even better, get in touch with them and ask them to reach out to me for an interview.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.960]   I would be thrilled to bring them on the show because I think that's a really valuable resource
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.840]   that we could learn together.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.960]   I've intentionally stayed away from talking about most of the healthcare issues just because
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.320]   it's an overwhelming world and people are so emotionally tied up.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.400]   At some point maybe I'll talk about it, but it's just about my least interesting thing
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.360]   to talk about.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:39.680]   But medical tourism is something that I think has a lot of potential benefit, especially
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   if you need an expensive root canal or something like that, consider taking a trip abroad.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680]   It may be worth it.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.360]   It may not be worth it, but a lot of those times those types of expenses are simply not
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   covered with insurance.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.320]   And if it's not covered with insurance, then why bother?
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.960]   Why not just go ahead and book yourself a trip to Thailand or Taiwan or Costa Rica or
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.880]   something like that, or Mexico, and try to enjoy your experience a little bit.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   You've got to be careful.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.960]   I have no experience in that world, but I have known enough people who have done it
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.640]   successfully to at least consider it as a strategy.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   That's it for today.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.520]   I'll be back with you tomorrow.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   Have a great day, everybody.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:47.240]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:55.240]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:01.520]   Your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.240]   about you.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:10.600]   This show is not and is not intended to be any form of financial advice.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:18.960]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.960]   trustworthy and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:32.000]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.720]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.720]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.280]   and I make mistakes.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.880]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment so
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.080]   we can all learn together.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:13:17.400]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.980]   (upbeat music)
