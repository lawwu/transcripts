[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060]   I would remind you that we are considering together the Apostles' argument at the beginning
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.940]   of the second chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and this evening we are going to look
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.000]   especially at the end of verse 4 and verse 5.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.680]   "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.400]   that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.200]   But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against or
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.620]   in the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God."
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.120]   We are here dealing with the third argument, you remember, that the Apostle knew that the
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.900]   Jews brought up against this teaching of his concerning the wrath of God and the utter
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:10.460]   absolute need of believing in justification by faith, namely accepting God's way of righteousness
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.400]   rather than that old way of righteousness to which they were trusting, which was by
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.620]   the law.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.680]   The first was that they were guilty of the very things that they condemned in others
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.880]   but were not conscious of their utter inconsistency in so doing and didn't see that they condemned
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.720]   themselves in so doing.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.480]   The second was their failure to remember that the judgment of God is always according to
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.080]   truth.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.520]   And then he comes to this third argument, which is their complete misunderstanding of
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.180]   the biblical teaching concerning the goodness of God and the forbearance and the longsuffering
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.200]   of God.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.340]   And especially as he puts it like this, "not knowing"—and that is willful, remember,
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.360]   not choosing to know—"regarding with contempt, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.680]   thee to repentance."
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.600]   Now we ended off last Friday evening with an emphasis on that extraordinary word that
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.500]   the apostle there uses, "knowing not that the goodness of God leadeth thee."
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.600]   And we just ended by saying that the teaching is that it is the function and the purpose
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:39.280]   of God's goodness and forbearance and longsuffering to bring us, to lead us, to repentance.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.640]   And therefore we have to consider this evening first and foremost this great and all-important
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.080]   word "repentance."
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.380]   I simply said last Friday as I closed that it is of very great importance for us to observe
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.200]   that this is always the first note in gospel preaching.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.720]   First and foremost, the gospel calls us to repentance.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.600]   I gave you quotations, I showed you how John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.800]   for the remission of sins.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.080]   There's the herald of the gospel.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.620]   Our Lord went and preached everywhere that men should repent.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.320]   Peter on the day of Pentecost brings it out like a thunderbolt, "Repent every one of
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.200]   you," he says, "and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   And as we saw the apostle Paul in saying farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus reminds
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.640]   them that this was his ministry.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.280]   He preached the repentance that is toward God and the faith that is toward the Lord
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.800]   Jesus Christ.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.080]   Now this question of order is a very important one and a very crucial one.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.800]   Obviously it's one of those determinative points in the whole matter of evangelism.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.360]   And I think you will agree when I say that surely this is something that we are tending
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.200]   to forget at the present time.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000]   The idea seems to have come in that the business of preaching is to bring people to Christ
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.040]   and that later on they will repent.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.700]   No, it's not a matter of accident that in the scriptures themselves the order is always
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.680]   put otherwise.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.080]   And surely it's a very dangerous thing for us in the interest of results to vary and
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.560]   to reverse the order that is so plainly set forth in the scripture, an order which has
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.160]   always characterized the preaching of the church in every great period of revival and
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   of reawakening.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.720]   It's not surprising that there is but little evidence of a sense of sin these days.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.200]   It's not surprising that it's a rare thing to see anybody weeping under conviction these
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.720]   days.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.580]   It's not surprising that it's a rare thing to hear of anybody going through an agony
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:03.360]   of soul because of his or her consciousness of sinfulness in the presence of a holy God.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.800]   If we don't preach repentance, of course we cannot expect to see such things.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.080]   But as you go back and read the great story of the Christian church in every period of
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.040]   revival and reawakening, you will always find that this note of repentance has always been
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.560]   central and it has always been primary.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.000]   However, I leave it at that and I pass on, because we must consider, what exactly then
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.880]   does repentance mean?
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.920]   The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.720]   That's what it's meant to do.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.880]   Well what is this?
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:48.200]   Well a very convenient way of looking at this is just to take the two words, the Latin word,
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.680]   which of course is the one from which our word "repentance" comes, and also the Greek
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.160]   word which covers this term.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.400]   Now the Latin term "repent" means "think again".
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.600]   You think again.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.120]   In other words, you normally thought in a given manner, and the effect of the call to
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.320]   repentance is, the effect of God's goodness should be, to cause us to stop and to think
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.560]   again.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.360]   Now there are many illustrations of this in the scripture.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.820]   The one that invariably appeals to me is the one which we have in the Gospel according
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.200]   to St. Matthew, chapter 21, verses 28 to 32, where our Lord himself spoke a parable on
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.960]   this very matter of repentance.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.200]   It's the so-called parable of the two sons, you remember.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.160]   Our Lord says that a certain man had two sons, and he said unto one of his sons, "Son, go
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.540]   work today in my vineyard."
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:59.640]   And he said to his father, "I go, sir," but he went not.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.760]   And then he turned to the second and said likewise, and he answered—I've got them
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.720]   in the wrong order—he answered and said, "I will not," but afterward he repented
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.840]   and went.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.560]   And he came to the second and said likewise, and he answered and said, "I go, sir,"
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   and went not.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.880]   Whether of them Twain did the will of his father, they say unto him the first.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.580]   Jesus saith unto them, "Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.160]   into the kingdom of God before you, for John came unto you in the way of righteousness,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:41.480]   and ye believed him not; but the publicans and harlots believed him; and he, when ye
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.640]   had seen it, repented not afterward that ye might believe him."
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.280]   Now it's this first son is the important one.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.320]   When his father told him to go and work in the vineyard, he answered and said, "I will
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.920]   not," but afterward he repented and went.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.880]   Now then, the first thing about repentance is, I say, that you think again.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.600]   Here is a young man, you see, his father tells him to go and work in my vineyard, he says,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   "I won't."
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.720]   But then you see him going to the vineyard, well, what happened to him?
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.760]   Well, obviously, he must have thought about the question the second time.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.120]   He thought again.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.380]   It's always an essential part of repentance.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.400]   There are certain things we all seem to have made up our minds about them before we come
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.840]   into this world.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.900]   For instance, the natural man doesn't believe in Christianity.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.480]   He's already against it.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.240]   He doesn't turn against it, he starts by being against it.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.680]   And no man becomes a Christian, therefore, without thinking again.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.840]   The average man in this country today has made up his mind about these things, and he
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   won't listen to them.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.000]   Now then, if ever such a man becomes a Christian, it means of necessity that he must have thought
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.520]   again, repented.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.200]   But obviously, the mere thinking again is not enough.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.320]   And that is where this Latin term, the Latin word from which our word comes, is really
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.000]   not sufficient.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.720]   Because you see, that first son in our Lord's parable may have thought again about the thing,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.640]   but still have come to the same conclusion.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.560]   But obviously he didn't.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.920]   He came to a different conclusion.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.900]   So the Greek word for repentance is a word that carries the idea of a change of mind.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.200]   Not only looking at it and thinking about it again, but changing your mind about it.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.980]   Coming to a different decision, arriving at a different conclusion.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.320]   So there is the second element.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.940]   And the third element is equally obvious.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:51.680]   That is, that it involves action, because a man acts according to his thinking.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.340]   And this son, you see, having said to his father, "I won't," hadn't gone to the vineyard.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.160]   But then when he thought again and changed his mind, he repented and went.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.800]   And the going is a part of the repentance.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.140]   In other words, it isn't something detached and theoretical and academic.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.460]   Repentance does include the idea of not only a change of mind, but a change of a course
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.540]   of action, a change in the whole direction and habit of one's life.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.460]   Very well.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:28.140]   What are the things about which one does change one's mind and one's course of action when
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.900]   one repents?
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:37.620]   First and foremost, we do this with respect to God himself.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.860]   That's the thing in the immediate context of what we're looking at.
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.340]   There are people who look at the goodness and the forbearance and the long-suffering
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.100]   of God, and they come to a certain conclusion.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.480]   But it's wrong.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.940]   And as I tried to show you, in coming to a wrong conclusion about that, they're coming
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.700]   to a wrong conclusion about the very character of God himself.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.260]   And that is the teaching of the Scripture everywhere.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:07.500]   The natural mind is enmity against God.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.820]   Its thoughts about God are wrong and are unworthy.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.580]   The natural man either doesn't think about God at all, or if he does, he thinks of him
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.500]   as some great tyrant that is set against men, someone who's unfair.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.460]   No doubt we shall get a lot of this during these present days.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.460]   Why does God allow this and that?
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.460]   That's the question.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.460]   There's the enmity.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:34.100]   You see, the view of God that is expressed by these questions, if God is a God of love,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.260]   why does he allow spastics, why does he allow war, and so on and so forth?
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.060]   Now that's the attitude.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:48.220]   An attitude towards the character of God and the being of God, toward God's greatness,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.700]   his justice, his love, his mercy, and his compassion.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:12:01.780]   The natural man has a totally wrong view of God and all his purposes and all his plans.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:08.420]   The first thing that happens when a man repents is that he begins to think differently about
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.420]   God.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.340]   Now, that was the trouble with the Jews, wasn't it?
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.820]   You see, it's the exact reversal of what happened in the Garden of Eden when the devil
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.420]   tempted Eve and then Adam.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.980]   The first thing insinuated into the mind of Eve was wrong thoughts about God.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.260]   Hath God said?
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.060]   Is God fair in saying it?
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.500]   Isn't God against you in saying such a thing?
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.020]   And there they accepted it and the wrong view of God came in.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.420]   Repentance just reverses all that.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.780]   We begin to realize that all our ideas of God have been totally wrong.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:53.180]   There is a sense in which repentance leads to the action which was taken by Job.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.580]   When God himself had spoken to him, the first thing he does is to put his hand upon his
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.580]   mouth.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:05.740]   He'd been talking wildly and loosely, but now that he comes, as it were, into the presence
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.660]   of God and God reveals himself to him, he puts his hand upon his mouth.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.940]   He doesn't want to speak.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.500]   He's afraid to speak.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.700]   He sees now how wrong he's been in so many of his ideas.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.180]   That's an essential part of repentance.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.980]   The Jews, I say, were constantly sinning in this respect.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:31.780]   And the great purpose of the preaching was to bring them to this new conception of God.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.100]   Now it's very important that we should emphasize this, for some people seem to think of repentance
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.940]   only in terms of actions.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.580]   They think repentance means that a man stops getting drunk or being an adulterer or something
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.100]   and begins to live a different life.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.100]   That's the end of it.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.740]   That isn't the beginning.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:55.900]   The beginning is this changed attitude towards God, this new thinking about God himself,
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:01.820]   thinking about God in terms of the scriptural revelation rather than in terms of our own
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:08.420]   ideas and our philosophies and our arguments from man to God instead of from God to man.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.540]   That's the first thing.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:19.220]   But obviously it also means that we think differently about ourselves, and this is quite
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   inevitable.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.580]   It's our thinking about God that controls our thinking about ourselves.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.540]   And this is the second thing we always need in sin, is to think about ourselves in a different
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.140]   way, to think again about ourselves and to change our minds about ourselves.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.420]   Because you see, by nature, we all think that we're very good and we're very nice people,
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.060]   and God isn't really very fair to us, and we're having a very hard time, and if only
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.580]   we were given an opportunity, the world would be perfect.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:58.380]   But the moment we begin really to know ourselves, we begin to say, "Vile and full of sin I am.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.780]   I am all unrighteousness.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.900]   In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.780]   That's how the repentant man speaks.
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.480]   He changes his view of himself.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.780]   Having admired himself, having praised himself, having been very pleased with himself, having
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:24.100]   found no defects in himself, though many always in others, he begins to see, as one of the
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.420]   old Puritans, I believe, put it, that he's nothing but a mass of corruption, that he's
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.380]   a festering sore.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.460]   Now that's the language that the scripture itself uses with respect to men in sin, and
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.660]   it's a tremendous thing when we begin to get this new view of ourselves.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.220]   And we no longer say, "Well, we don't think that God is quite fair.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.740]   What amazes us is how God tolerates us at all."
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.340]   We no longer feel we've got any claim on the love of God, but we are reduced to tears when
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.080]   we realize that in spite of our being what we are and God being what he is, that he nevertheless
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.300]   has had mercy and compassion, and that there is such a thing as grace.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.340]   That's repentance.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.860]   And you see how important it is to define it like this.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:20.000]   It isn't only a matter of actions; it's a man's view of himself, I say, as well.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.020]   Do we abhor ourselves?
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.980]   Job abhorred himself.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.940]   He said so.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.820]   He hated himself.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.300]   You can't read the Bible without seeing that all these men have come to know God have all
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.920]   done the same thing.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.020]   Read your Christian biographies again, and they've all said it.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.020]   They've hated themselves and despised themselves.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:49.260]   Now, I'm not arguing that we should all feel it to the same intensity as the greatest saints
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:54.580]   have felt it, but I am arguing that surely we can't claim to have repented unless that
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:17:01.420]   is in some shape or form our view of ourselves.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.180]   Self-defense goes when we repent.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.300]   We feel we deserve nothing but punishment.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.180]   We realize that we are paupers, that we are vile.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.060]   A man changes his view about himself, and, of course, he changes his view consequently
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.100]   about everything.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.220]   His whole view of life is different.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:25.540]   Before this, you see, his idea of life was, well, what the world is enjoying tonight or
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.860]   what it persuades itself that it is enjoying.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.640]   But the moment a man repents, he's got an entirely different view of life.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.940]   He sees himself now, you see, in the light of God and before God.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.620]   He sees life now as a journey in the direction of God, not a place into which you come to
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.820]   settle down and just have a good time, so-called, and let yourself go and live like an animal
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.740]   to the lusts of the flesh and so on.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.740]   No, no.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.500]   He sees man now as someone under God with a great and a glorious destiny, and his whole
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.140]   view of life in this world becomes a different one.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.140]   Like those great men depicted in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, he
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.880]   sees life as a journey, as a pilgrimage.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.860]   He's but a sojourner in this world.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.920]   He's traveling home to God, and his whole view of life and everything that happens in
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.220]   it becomes quite different.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.580]   That's a part of repentance.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:26.460]   And likewise, his view of death, and, of course, as a consequence of all these things, his
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:36.300]   conduct changes, and his view of right and wrong behavior undergoes a very profound change.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:43.280]   But, and this is what I wanted to emphasize and have been trying to emphasize, the conduct
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.340]   and the behavior are the end result of repentance, not the beginning of repentance, not the whole
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.140]   of repentance.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:19:01.100]   The conduct and the behavior must change of necessity because of the changed view of God
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.860]   and man, of life and death, of judgment and eternity, and all these tremendous things.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:13.900]   Well, now, then, this is what the apostle is arguing, that the goodness of God and his
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:21.420]   forbearance and his long-suffering were meant to lead us to that.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:28.700]   And that patently, therefore, if we fail to come to that, we are entirely misunderstanding
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.220]   the goodness of God.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.900]   Indeed, we are guilty of despising the goodness of God.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:42.220]   Now, God reveals this goodness and this forbearance and this long-suffering in order that we may
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.220]   ask questions.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.140]   We may say, "Well, now, why does God do that?
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.460]   Do we deserve that?" and so on.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.100]   You begin to think again, and you should, having thought again, you should change your
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.940]   mind about all these things.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.500]   And you should end by saying, "Isn't it wonderful that God ever blesses this world
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.580]   at all?
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.980]   The world that he made, but which rebelled against him and sinned against him?
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.460]   Why does he send the rain?
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.060]   Why does he cause the sun to shine?
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.380]   Why doesn't he blast us all out of being and out of existence and punish us to all
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.900]   eternity immediately?"
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.940]   That's the kind of thing that the goodness and the long-suffering of God should lead
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.900]   us to question.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:28.300]   And as we question, we should end by being amazed at his mercy, his compassion, his forbearance,
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.660]   and his long-suffering.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.500]   And we should end by worshipping him.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:43.060]   "But," says the apostle, "these people do not know, not knowing, that the goodness
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:48.140]   of God leadeth thee to repentance."
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.420]   But he doesn't leave it at that, because that isn't the only thing which they don't
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.660]   know.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:02.180]   Indeed, it seems to me that at this point the apostle is gathering together a number
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.820]   of things which the Jews particularly, and all who are in that position and who have
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:12.240]   that attitude, he gathers together a number of things which they don't know.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240]   That was the first.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.900]   But let me go on to show you the others that he elaborates in the fifth verse.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:27.660]   They don't know, or they don't realize also, why they are in this condition.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:33.700]   Here they are, they despise the goodness and the forbearance and the long-suffering of
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.700]   God.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:41.180]   Now, I say that in the fifth verse he tells us that they don't realize why they despise
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.680]   it.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.240]   They don't realize what it is in them that accounts for the fact that instead of being
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.520]   led by this goodness to worship God and to repent and to yield themselves to him and
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.000]   to believe in his Son, they do the exact opposite.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Why do they do that?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.080]   Well, now this is what they're ignorant of.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:09.000]   They're ignorant, he says, of their hardness and their impenitent hearts.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.380]   Now this is, again, a most profound matter of doctrine.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:20.260]   I take first the word "heart," because this can well be translated like this, "But after
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:29.380]   thy hard and impenitent heart," the hardness applies to the heart as well as the impenitence.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.260]   The trouble with men, therefore, in sin, according to the apostle here, as indeed everywhere
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.300]   in the Scripture, is this.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:41.180]   The trouble with men is in his heart.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:46.940]   And here, by heart, he means the center of personality.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:52.100]   It doesn't merely mean the emotions or the affections, it includes that.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:23:00.020]   But the heart, in Scripture, stands for the very seat and center and throne of personality.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.600]   Now there, you see, according to the Scriptural teaching, is the seat of sin.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.980]   The essence of sin is to be found there and nowhere else.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:13.460]   Now I don't keep you tonight by showing you how completely that is in contrast with the
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.740]   modern view of sin, which is this, that a man rarely in his heart is all right, but
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.980]   he goes wrong in this respect and that respect.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.620]   It's exactly the other way around.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.880]   It's the heart that's wrong, and men are only right in patches on the surface.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.620]   The complete reversal of the modern view of sin.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.660]   Now let me show you how this is the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:42.420]   We've already had it indeed in the first chapter, in verse 21, where Paul says, "Because that
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:48.300]   when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:55.660]   vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.620]   There it is, exactly the same thing.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.340]   You remember how the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it in the third chapter
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:09.540]   in the twelfth verse, where he warns the people to whom he is writing against an "evil heart
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.420]   of unbelief," "evil heart of unbelief," you notice.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.820]   Jeremiah has already said it in the seventeenth chapter of his prophecy, in the ninth verse.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:25.260]   "The heart," he says, "is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.580]   Who can know it?"
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:32.300]   The heart's the trouble, you see, and our Lord himself has said, "It is out of the heart
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:38.060]   that proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, and so on."
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.820]   It isn't that which goes into the men, it's that which comes out, and the whole source
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.860]   of trouble with mankind, says our Lord, is this evil heart that men's got.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:53.140]   Now then, this is obviously very fundamental for us.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.740]   In other words, the trouble with men is not merely in his intellect.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.820]   It isn't merely in his mind.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.260]   There is trouble in his mind, but alas, the trouble with men is very much deeper than
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.860]   that.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.060]   And that is where so many go wrong, that is where all who are not Christian go wrong.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:19.740]   That is, of course, at the basis of the pathetic belief, especially in the last hundred years,
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.180]   that you've got nothing to do but to educate men and women, and they'll live a good life.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:31.260]   You see, it's been believed, but we are living in a world again tonight which shows how nonsensical
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.940]   it is.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.300]   The world, in a sense, has never been so highly educated as it is now.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.580]   But you see, here we are.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.100]   Are we on the verge of war again?
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.100]   What's the matter?
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.860]   Well, there's only one answer.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.540]   It's the evil heart that's in men.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.260]   "Why are there wars amongst you?"
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.100]   "Well, it's because of your lusts and your passions," says James.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.100]   Man isn't just an intellect.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.980]   There's something in men which is much more powerful than his intellect, and that is what
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.260]   is called his heart.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.220]   Man, doesn't matter how brilliant a brain he's got, nor how highly educated he may be,
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:08.500]   is much more governed by his instincts, and by that which is elemental in him, than by
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.140]   his higher centers.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.980]   You see, if that were not so, educated people would never pass through the divorce court,
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:23.100]   and they'd never behave as calves, and there'd be no such thing as infidelity and immorality.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.380]   But it doesn't matter, you see, what the brain is like.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.100]   There's something more fundamental, this flesh that the apostle talks about, this law in
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.660]   my members, warring against the law of my mind.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:44.060]   That's the thing, and that's the heart, this hard and impenitent heart.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:50.140]   And you see, my friends, the more you grasp that, the more you will see the absolute necessity
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:57.100]   of an operation by the Holy Spirit of God, before a man can ever be a Christian.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:03.500]   I've already quoted to you what the apostle says in the eighth chapter of this great epistle.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:09.060]   The natural mind, he says, you see, and there he's including the whole men again, is enmity
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.840]   against God.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:16.160]   The trouble with men is not simply that they don't believe in God, they hate God.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.800]   And it's no use disputing it, it is a fact.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.780]   Man in sin hates God.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   There's a vituperation, there's an antipathy, there is a veritable hatred in the heart of
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   man.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.380]   That is why men are always hoping that at last somebody, some scientist or somebody
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.220]   is going to prove that there isn't a God.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.300]   How delighted the whole world would be.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.300]   Why?
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.140]   Well, because they hate him.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.620]   It's something very deep.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.460]   So we must emphasize this word "heart."
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:55.940]   And then I take up the word "hard," after thy hardness, after thy hard heart.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:01.460]   Here, of course, the picture is a perfectly clear one.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.780]   It's a sort of callosity, a corn, if you like.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.300]   You know, if you use your hands a lot with many will labor, they become hard, the skin
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   becomes hardened.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   That's the sort of thing.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.760]   But let's look at this hardness in a different way.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.720]   Take a lump of clay, which you can mold and fashion almost as you like, put it out in
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.160]   the blazing sunshine, and it'll become as hard as a brick.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.840]   I think he's got something of that idea here.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.160]   And I look at it like this.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:40.280]   The goodness and the forbearance and the long-suffering of God are shining down upon mankind like the
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.520]   sun.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.080]   And they are meant to soften us and to melt us.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.560]   But what they do to these people is to harden them.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.300]   The sun does both things, doesn't it?
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.840]   It melts butter, it hardens clay.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.220]   And according to the apostle here, it's one or the other always.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.140]   And that is why the preaching of the gospel is such a tremendously responsible thing.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.500]   And that is why listening to the gospel is such a tremendously responsible thing.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.720]   It either softens or hardens.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.320]   It's one or the other.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.000]   It's bound to do one or the other.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.160]   And what he says here is this, that these people, because of their completely wrong
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:23.360]   attitude, are hardened by the very thing that was meant to melt them and to soften them.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   Hardness.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:30.840]   Oh, again you find this running right through the scriptural teaching.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.200]   Again we go to Hebrews chapter 3, verse 13, "Lest any of you be hardened," says the
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.040]   man, "through the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.840]   Sin in its deceitfulness hardens us.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.640]   It hardens our hearts.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.240]   That is this terrible process.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.320]   It is a process.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.680]   In other words, every time we refuse to listen to God's voice, we are correspondingly to
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   that extent becoming harder.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.120]   And it's going to be more difficult next time, as it were.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.440]   It's a process of hardening, "Lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.640]   of sin."
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:19.360]   And so you can often trace in the life story of an individual this process of hardening
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.480]   as it goes on.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.200]   It's a terrible term.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.620]   It's a very realistic term.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:30.400]   And the terrible thing is, as I say, to contemplate the fact that it is the love and the compassion
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.760]   of God that, as it were, produces the hardening.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.720]   If you don't respond to it, it will harden you.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.100]   And that brings me to the word "impenitent," which is again, you see, you notice that these
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.040]   terms that he's using are the opposites, as it were, of all he'd been saying in verse
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   four.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.920]   "Despisest thou the riches of the goodness and the forbearance and the longsuffering
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.300]   of God, shining like the sun, as it were?"
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.520]   Not knowing that the goodness of God "leadeth thee to repentance."
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:08.140]   Ah, but they don't, they're the exact opposite, "impenitent heart."
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.380]   And what's an impenitent heart?
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:20.660]   Well, an impenitent heart is a heart that is so hard, with such callosities upon it,
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.500]   that it cannot repent.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.100]   You remember that we are told about a king in the Old Testament.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.420]   He was on the point of being punished, but the prophet spoke to him, and he accepted
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:39.220]   the teaching, and God said to him, "Because thine heart was tender," he forgives him,
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.420]   "because thine heart was tender, a softening had come him."
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:51.420]   "Savior," says the hymn, "when my heart is tender, I will yield my heart to thee."
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.900]   That's it, and it's only the man who's got a tender heart, whoever desires to yield
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.500]   it to the Lord.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:03.240]   But these people, their hearts are hard, so they're incapable of repentance.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.820]   Now this is, again, a great idea in the Scripture, work it out for yourselves.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.740]   What we are told is that this is what happens to us in regeneration.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:17.020]   God says through the prophet Ezekiel, "I will take out of you the stony heart, and
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.100]   I will give you a heart of flesh."
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:27.020]   The stony heart can never be softened, it's got to be changed, and we are given a heart
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.080]   of flesh which can respond.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.300]   That stone you see, it can't respond, it's set and it's fixed, and you can do nothing
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.300]   with it.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.980]   We need a new heart, a change of heart.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.800]   The stone is taken out, the flesh is put in.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.440]   Well there it is, it's an impenitent heart, which means that it's incapable of repentance,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.820]   it doesn't admit the repentance for which God in his goodness is leading us.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.740]   That's the second thing which this kind of man doesn't know.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.700]   He doesn't know why he is as he is.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.700]   He thinks it's a matter of knowledge, he thinks it's a matter of learning.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.840]   He doesn't realize that his trouble is deep down in the very depths of his heart.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.500]   And it is the business of preaching to convince men of that.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.660]   But let me go on to the next thing.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:22.620]   He doesn't realize either, says the apostle, what he is doing quite inevitably by thus
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.460]   despising the goodness of God.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.460]   What is he doing?
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:32.460]   Well he says he is treasuring up for himself wrath.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.540]   But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against or
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.580]   on the day of wrath and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:49.180]   Now this is an extraordinary and indeed a terrifying thing in many senses.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.260]   Again you notice a contrast with verse 4.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:59.620]   In verse 4 Paul talks about the riches of God's goodness and forbearance and longsuffering.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.460]   And here in a sense he is talking about riches again.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:09.740]   There God has treasured up his goodness, here man is treasuring up wrath for himself.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.860]   You notice the play on words, he is bringing out the antithesis.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:25.140]   So we can put it like this, man in refusing the stored up riches of God's goodness is
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.620]   storing up for himself wrath.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.320]   This is an interesting word, this word storing up.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:38.020]   You talk about a thesaurus, well there it is, that's the very word, something where
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.480]   meanings of words are stored up.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.780]   And that is the thing the apostle tells us that is happening.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.700]   Now this is the most terrible thing to contemplate.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.140]   Think of the unbeliever, think of the person who is not a Christian in the world at this
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.140]   moment.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:35:00.060]   Here he is, he is misunderstanding, and he is ignoring God's goodness and longsuffering
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:06.980]   and his forbearance, and he doesn't repent, he just goes on and makes use of it to suit
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   his own ends.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   What's he doing?
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:15.940]   Well he is storing up for himself, every time he misunderstands that he is adding to this.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:21.100]   Think of the whole picture of a man treasuring up something, he is a collector of pearls
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.300]   if you like, he is a collector of anything.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.940]   And he gathers them and he takes them, he unlocks his cabinet, he puts the thing in,
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.140]   he locks it up again, then he gets another, he puts it in, he is treasuring up, he is
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.140]   storing up.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.780]   That's exactly what the unbeliever is doing says the apostle.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.860]   He doesn't know it, but he is doing it.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.600]   He is treasuring up in this way, wrath.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.660]   And this is the terrible thing, it's man himself who is doing this.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:54.940]   He doesn't say that God is doing it, but after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:59.260]   up unto thyself wrath.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.580]   This is the truly alarming and terrifying thing.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.700]   It would be a terrible thing if every time we are guilty of this, God as it were put
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.220]   a mark down against us.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.940]   But according to this teaching, it's the man himself who is doing it.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.300]   He is treasuring up for himself.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.940]   He is the one who is locking up all this for himself.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:28.500]   Each time in other words we despise God's goodness, this kind of individual is simply
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:39.220]   storing up for himself this wrath of God against him, and he doesn't know it.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.740]   But the last thing which he doesn't know is this.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:52.220]   He doesn't know, he doesn't realize what finally awaits him, and what is that?
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:37:04.700]   Well, it is the day of wrath, the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.980]   Now here again is something surely which we need to put before the whole world at a time
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.160]   like this.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.140]   You and I are living in a century of wars, a century of judgments.
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.620]   It's the only explanation.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.260]   That's the meaning of these wars.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.340]   They are a part of God's judgment upon sin.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.580]   We saw that when we considered the end of the first chapter of this great epistle.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.060]   God is giving the world over.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.940]   In its sin and its arrogance, he is giving it over to a reprobate mind.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:43.100]   He is allowing it to reap the consequences of its own false attitude towards him.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:51.740]   But all these things, the two world wars, what's happening at the present time, they
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:58.980]   are but pale adumbrations of something which is to come.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:06.860]   And the something which is to come is the day of wrath, treasurous up against thyself
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:18.020]   or for thyself, wrath, on the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.620]   of God.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:27.060]   Now, you good friends are familiar with your scriptures, and that you know therefore that
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:34.940]   everywhere in the Bible we are taught that there is to be a definite day of judgment,
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.540]   a particular day.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.420]   The apostle Paul in preaching in Athens, you remember, says this, "God now commandeth
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.860]   all men everywhere to repent, because he says he hath appointed a day in which he will judge
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:54.020]   the world in righteousness by that man which he hath appointed, whereof he hath given notice
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.540]   in that he hath raised him up from the dead."
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:04.640]   That day is appointed a day, it's a day that is already determined by God.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.140]   The Lord Jesus Christ said he didn't know the day, and the angels didn't know the day.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.780]   It's God alone who knows it, but he does know it.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:19.020]   In God's eternal calendar there is a day of judgment.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.620]   You find it everywhere in the scriptures.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:28.820]   The apostle in talking about himself and Apollos in writing the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.420]   and the other teachers, he says, "All right, every man's building upon this one and only
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:38.620]   foundation, some build wood, hay, and stubble, and others gold and precious metals."
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.700]   He says, "The day will declare it.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:47.940]   Every man's work shall be judged, the day will declare it, the day of judgment."
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.420]   Did you notice it in that reading at the beginning?
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.660]   Now to the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the day of the Lord.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.740]   Some people were teaching that the day of the Lord was at hand or had already come.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:07.060]   It hasn't, says Paul, certain other things have got to happen first, the day of the Lord.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.700]   But it will come.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.260]   "He which hath begun a good work in you," he says to the Philippians, "he which hath
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:22.460]   begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.540]   It's the same day all along.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:30.580]   It's the day of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ to the final judgment of the world.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.060]   That's the day.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:37.660]   And indeed you read about it in the book of Revelations, the last verse particularly in
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:44.900]   chapter 6, "The great day of his wrath is come."
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.100]   Read the book of Revelation again, keep your eye on this day and the manifestation of the
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.100]   wrath of God.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:55.500]   It's the whole of the scriptural teaching, the whole world, the whole of history is heading
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:01.260]   up to this great day of judgment, the day it calls it.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.540]   Very well.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.940]   It is to be a day of revelation of something.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.780]   And this word "revelation" is important.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.740]   The judgment of God is going on now.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.780]   The judgment of God is going on day by day.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:21.500]   "Some men's sins are revealed beforehand," says Paul to Timothy, "and they get their
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.500]   punishment.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.400]   Some are not, and they will get their punishment too.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.060]   But a great deal is revealed now."
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.140]   We've already dealt with that, I say, in chapter 1.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.780]   A great deal has happened, a great deal is happening.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:39.260]   God's judgment is being revealed, but, "It is only at that day it shall be revealed and
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.500]   unfolded in all its fullness."
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:50.180]   Do you remember how the Apostle Peter puts it like this in his second epistle, second
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:56.780]   chapter, fourth verse, "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:05.700]   down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment."
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.780]   They've already been judged innocent, they were driven out of heaven, yes, but they are
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.580]   being reserved in chains for the judgment of the great day.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:20.260]   And indeed Peter says it in the first epistle, in the third chapter, verse 19, where he says,
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:27.180]   "That our Lord, in spirit, preached to the spirits in prison that once were disobedient
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.180]   in the time of Noah."
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:35.220]   They are in prison now, they are spirits in prison, waiting, they've already received
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.300]   a good deal of judgment, but the great day is the day when the final sentence will be
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:47.860]   promulgated, and God will announce his verdict upon all men, every single individual.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:53.680]   It's the most tremendous thing, in a sense, in the whole of Scripture.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.580]   Let me just read one passage before we close.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.700]   I take you to the twentieth chapter of the book of Revelation.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:05.980]   Let me read from verse eleven, "And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:12.340]   it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.740]   them.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.940]   And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:24.820]   And the books were opened," ah, here you see, "the books were opened, the books which sinners
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:31.820]   have been marking themselves without realizing it, the books were opened.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:36.580]   And another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:41.940]   of those things which were written in the books according to their works.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.940]   And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.300]   which were in them.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.580]   And they were judged every man according to their works, and death and hell were cast
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.060]   into the lake of fire.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.820]   This is the second death.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:44:05.740]   And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:14.580]   That's the day, the day when the books will be opened, and all this wrath that men have
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:21.260]   been treasuring up for themselves will be produced in evidence against them and punished.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:27.860]   And what will be revealed, he tells us again, is the righteous judgment of God.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.620]   Nobody will have any complaint.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:38.420]   Everybody will see it then, and that is why the book of Revelation tells us earlier that
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.020]   some people, when they see it, will say to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.020]   and hide us."
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:50.980]   There will be no excuse, there will be no plea; it's a righteous judgment.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:54.060]   God's judgment is always according to truth.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:45:02.380]   And on that great day, the truth, the righteousness, the justice will be finally revealed.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.460]   Well, there it is.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:10.260]   That is what the apostle says about those Jews who misunderstood the goodness of God.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:17.600]   They're ignorant, they don't know that it was meant to lead to repentance.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:22.860]   They don't know what it is in them that leads them not to repent.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:28.220]   They don't know that by not repenting they're treasuring up wrath against themselves.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:35.100]   And they don't know and they don't realize that they shall have to stand before God and
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:41.420]   give an account of these things and be confronted by all his goodness, his forbearance, and
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:47.400]   his long-suffering, above all, by the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, the one whom
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   they have pierced.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:56.880]   "For every eye shall see him, yea, and they that pierced him."
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.020]   What an appalling ignorance.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:07.060]   Beloved Christian people, your business and mine is to enlighten people about these things,
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:13.340]   so that as you talk to them about the present crisis, lead it on to that.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.640]   Ask them why it is these things keep on happening.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.220]   Ask them what it is that's wrong with men.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.580]   Don't be content merely with discussing newspaper headings or taking the wealthy man's view
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.400]   of these things.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.620]   Make them see what it's all due to.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.780]   They're ignorant, not knowing.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.380]   And your business and mine is to give them the knowledge, to open their eyes, to enlighten
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:47.660]   them, and to exhort them to repent and to flee from the wrath to come.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.940]   Amen.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.820]   Our Heavenly Father, we come into thy presence again.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:47:01.780]   O Lord, we know not how to thank thee that thou hast opened our eyes and given us to
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.620]   see something of these things.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:15.180]   We simply cast ourselves before thee in humble praise and thanksgiving and worship and adoration.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:23.540]   O Lord, we pray and beseech thee, have mercy upon the people.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:32.300]   We feel like saying, O God, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:41.420]   God have mercy upon our world, and open the eyes of the people by the blessed gospel through
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.060]   thy Holy Spirit.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:51.580]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:58.260]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:06.620]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.340]   Amen.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:12.260]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
