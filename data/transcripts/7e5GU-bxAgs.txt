[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.360]   All right, we got a question here from Thiego. He says, Does working smarter beat talent?
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.160]   I'm a data scientist and researcher, so I know the value of good work. But you really think an
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.320]   average person who follows this path can achieve a PhD from MIT and make breakthroughs in science?
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.920]   Yeah, it's a complicated question, Thiego. It's a complicated question in part because talent is
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.200]   very vague exactly what that means. But I do think, yeah, it's realistic to say, no, not every
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.480]   professional objective, ambitious professional objective you have is necessarily achievable.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   Right? And this might be because of talent. My personal view is that talent is a complicated
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.760]   picture because it involves a lot of training. And it involves the circumstances for training.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.120]   It might involve maybe your personality is well-suited to stick with certain types of training.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.720]   I'm not a big believer in this, just you have this talent that makes it doing really complicated,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.040]   high-level work easy for you. High-level complicated work requires a lot of training.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.240]   But some people end up, now you're 20 years old, and for whatever reason, you've been exposed to
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.600]   and have done a lot of that training. And someone who hasn't, you're in two different places. So I
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.560]   find talent to be a vague issue. So I don't typically use that term. But I do think it's true.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.160]   Yeah, not every objective is open to everyone. So for example, I'm going to first be,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   what would you call it, sort of braggadocious. And then I'm going to humble myself. Right? I'll
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.120]   use myself as an example. Because you mentioned PhD from MIT. All right. So when I was in college,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.760]   for whatever reason, I found the computer science work, especially the mathematical
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.120]   or theoretical computer science work, pretty easy. Right? And I always used to think, well,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.000]   that must be because I had good study habits. I managed my time well, or this or that. But I
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.280]   received an email like a year or two ago from the fellow student who I used to work with on my theory
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.520]   and algorithms problem sets. And this was the student I like to work with because he was very
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.480]   sharp and we would be very efficient together. And I guess he saw one of my articles or something.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.640]   And he sent me a message and said, oh, it was cool to see whatever some article he saw of mine.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.280]   And he said, my memory from Dartmouth was working with you on some of these problem sets or whatever
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.160]   we'd working on was, oh, I can't do that. I know now I'm not going to be a professor, this or that.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.760]   I guess that's what it looks like when someone has a really strong aptitude for something. So
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.680]   that was his memory, is that it caught his attention and tempered his ambition, seeing
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   me working on these problem sets. So I guess there was some sort of thing there that made
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.800]   me good at that. But then I go to MIT and it became clear after a while of, oh, the top people
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.720]   here, the people who are going to be at the top of the theoretical computer science field,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.080]   I'm never going to be that. So there's things you can do, things you can't do. So for whatever
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   reason, I was pretty good at this stuff, but also not the best in the world. And I'm not sure if I
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.280]   would have been able to get to the best of the world. So I don't know, I'm sort of wandering
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.640]   here, which is my way of saying of like, yeah, there are some limits to what you can do. It's
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.880]   more obvious with physical stuff. I'm not going to play professional sports. I'm still holding
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.600]   out hope I'm going to play professional baseball, but I think that window is closing pretty rapidly
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.040]   here. So it's more obvious there than with intellectual stuff. I think people have more
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.520]   gives and they realize, but some of this stuff gets baked in over a decade of training. It's
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.280]   really hard to say, but all right, let's put that all aside then and say, so what do we do about it?
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.120]   I say, let's forget about that. Let's forget about talent. Let's forget about, can I do anything I
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.400]   want to do? And ask the better question. What is the real advantage you get from working smarter
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.800]   and deeper? So being really intentional about how you work and what you work on and how you organize
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.920]   your life. The goal there is not to enable the accomplishment of arbitrarily elite professional
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.440]   accomplishment. The goal is to give yourself the best shot of living a deep life. If you're
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.760]   intentional, if you're deep, if you're organized, you're making the most of your current circumstances,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.800]   that is the leverage you need to shape your life into something you can control. That's the leverage
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.080]   you need that when you do lifestyle centered career planning, you can push your life towards
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.560]   the lifestyle that resonates and away from the things that don't. That's what you need to feel
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.160]   engaged and meaningful and competent and efficacious. That is more important than I think
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.960]   hitting some arbitrary professional goal. I'm not going to be a MacArthur Genius Grant winning
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.400]   top in the world theoretician, but it doesn't mean that I can't use the skills I do have that I am
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.160]   carefully developing to try to build a really cool life. And that friend of mine, who's was very,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.400]   very smart, he might be saying, okay, I guess I wasn't going to be a professional academic to do
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.680]   theoretical computer science, but I'm sure he's doing something really cool and interesting with
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   his life because he was very sharp and focused and was working with what he wanted to do. And so
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.560]   that's what I would say, Thiego, who cares about this debate? About how much is, are you born with?
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.280]   How much is it life circumstances that trains you? How much of it can you just change now through
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.320]   deliberate practice? I don't know. Possible to answer. So why don't we just focus on what we
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.520]   can control and try to build the deepest, most interesting life possible, each one that's going
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:56.400]   to look different. That's a good question.
