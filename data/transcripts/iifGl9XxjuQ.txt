[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.780]   - What's the advice to someone who's passionate
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.560]   about a thing that's not necessarily a revenue source
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   for their life right now?
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.700]   - It's what's going to bring you the most joy
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.060]   and it's worth it.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.540]   You know, I think it's, if you go to work
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.260]   and your work makes you happy,
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.800]   that's living the dream at any level.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   And if it's very successful financially,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.600]   great, that's just sort of gravy,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.900]   but it's more about your peace of mind.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.600]   And I think that if there is something
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.980]   that makes you truly happy
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.040]   and maybe you have to do something else
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.240]   to supplement your income,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.640]   try to balance those things as best you can.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.560]   - Yeah, I've actually,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.600]   I've turned my position on this in the past few years.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720]   I used to say, oh, go follow your passion,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.320]   you know, find a way to make that your job.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.920]   But if you have a job that allows you
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.640]   to follow your passion, not as a job, that's okay.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.440]   - Yeah, that's enough.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.260]   - And for a lot of people,
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.200]   my brother-in-law went pro golfing
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.280]   and then hated it because it was his job
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.720]   and then got a job and just golfs on the weekend
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.800]   and loves it.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.380]   And so I think for some people,
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.880]   even pursuing it to some extent can actually take away,
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.200]   I don't know if there was ever a moment in your career
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.180]   where it was like skating to win competitions
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.700]   and to win trophies was just too much
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.960]   and it took away the fun.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.960]   - Yeah, for sure, especially in the late '80s,
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.320]   I became a machine and it was very cyclical
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.680]   and it was like, all right,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.040]   there's an event coming up next weekend.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.320]   I've got to learn a couple of new tricks for the event
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.160]   because the judges saw what I'm,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.080]   you know, they saw my current roster of tricks.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.080]   So I got to hide it from them
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.800]   and then unleash it in the finals.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.920]   And then, but it became so formulaic
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.200]   that it really was not fun.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.080]   And at some point I just pulled away
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.360]   and stepped away from it altogether
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.680]   because skating had become a job and it wasn't fun for me.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.040]   And then when I did pull away,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.720]   I got very creative with my skating
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.480]   and I was able to really learn a lot of different techniques
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   and a lot of stuff that I wanted to pursue,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.560]   even though I wasn't making a living at it at the time.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.440]   I mean, I kind of was,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.520]   I still had signature skateboards and whatnot,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.480]   but when you're not, in those years,
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.440]   if you were not competing actively,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.400]   you were not going to get coverage.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.960]   You were not going to get career opportunities.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.440]   But I was willing to let those go
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800]   to just at least be happy with it.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   And so it gave me this new sort of new energy
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.320]   to come back to competing
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.840]   and with a different approach that was more,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.760]   it was more, I don't know how to explain it.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   I guess it was less careful and it was more risky.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.720]   That was it.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.400]   I came at it with a sense of,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160]   I'm going to just try everything.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040]   If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.880]   I'd rather just do this and take the chances
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.840]   and have fun doing it.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.040]   And if it works, then it's going to work awesomely.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.520]   The downside to that was that
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.520]   when I did come back to competing,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.480]   it was when skateboarding was starting to take a downturn.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.560]   So I came back with this renewed energy
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.240]   and I was winning a lot of big events.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.520]   And all of a sudden it was like, what happened?
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.920]   Where's the crowd?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.120]   Where's the contests?
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.160]   - Where's the prize money?
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.520]   - You guys like, turn the machines back on.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.960]   I thought this was cool.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.480]   And so it was kind of like
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.160]   the wrong place at the right time.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.040]   - But you probably wouldn't have had the career
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.680]   you had after that, had that not happened.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.560]   - No, no.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.440]   Because in those dead years,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.440]   I was skating more than ever.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.560]   Having fun doing it.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.200]   Learning new tricks and learning new techniques.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.040]   It was just that I wasn't doing it in front of crowds
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.400]   because the crowds weren't there anymore.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.040]   - Yeah, I think I'm very fortunate that,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.800]   and I think you did the same with your podcast.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.640]   Like when you start a podcast,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.720]   if you can start it not needing to be
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.360]   your job and your business,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   you can do whatever you want with it.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.480]   You can kind of say, you know what?
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.760]   This podcast was not, you know, when I started it,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.920]   I never thought I'd be going over countries as episodes.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.000]   And then I was like, you know what?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.840]   I'm going to London.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.360]   I want to talk to someone who knows everything about London.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   Let's make an episode about London.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.640]   And then we did one on Japan.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.240]   So I think when you really start to do
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.040]   what you're passionate about in your work,
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.760]   it sometimes creates an even better experience.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.920]   And people love these episodes and I never had an idea.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.760]   - Oh yeah.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.480]   No, I think, well, my cohost, Jason Ellis and I,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.080]   we have a lot of,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.680]   we have a lot of experience, obviously skating,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.960]   but just life experience.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.800]   He was, you know, had a totally different path than I did.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.240]   And when we have guests, especially with non-skating guests,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.920]   we relate to them in different ways
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.040]   that people would not expect,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   but in a very parallel way.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.360]   For instance, we had two wrestlers on,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.400]   that's our most recent guests,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.080]   and Darby Allen and Jamie Hayter.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.800]   And people were like, why would you have them on?
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.600]   And then when we started to talk about our experiences
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.520]   and our injuries, we were right in line
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.040]   and we were bouncing off of each other.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.800]   And it was a really great conversation.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.240]   It was fascinating, you know,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.120]   and say what you will about wrestling
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.080]   or that it's made up or whatever it is,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   they are, those guys take as much abuse as skateboarders.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.360]   - Yeah, it was great.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.480]   I listened to this episode.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.280]   It was wild to kind of,
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.440]   I don't think I've gotten that behind the scenes look
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.280]   at wrestling.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.440]   You know, it hasn't been a passion of mine,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.160]   but it was super fascinating.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.600]   And you don't have to say who,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   but I know there's some cool guests coming down the pike.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.960]   So if anyone's listening and wants to check it out.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.000]   - Yeah, we have an insane roster coming up
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.840]   and I feel like now we're starting to hit our stride
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.960]   and we've been doing it a couple of years.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.240]   So you're right, it wasn't something that we needed
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.440]   but we enjoy doing it.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.640]   And we did find that we had something unique to offer.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.560]   We found a groove, we found an audience.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.400]   It was just that we weren't doing all the right things
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.960]   with the algorithms and the, you know, the promotions.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.360]   And so now we have a group, Malka,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.880]   that is taking the reins on that
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.960]   and they've been doing a great job.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   So we get to focus more on the content.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.520]   - Podcast is great.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   I enjoy it, especially 'cause I have my childhood
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.720]   skate dreams still somewhere buried in my head.
