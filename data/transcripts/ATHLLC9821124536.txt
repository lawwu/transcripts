[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.800]   free to join.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.160]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.640]   You heard about it here again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.680]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.640]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.680]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.640]   optimizer who loves doing all the research to get you the best experience
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.080]   in life without an expensive price tag to make that happen.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.680]   I'm sitting down with the world's best experts every week to learn the
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.640]   strategies, tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.560]   Today, I'm talking with Andrew Warner, a serial entrepreneur who in his
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.440]   twenties started a successful internet business doing 30 million in sales.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.480]   Later, he started Mixergy, a platform that offers interviews, courses, and
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.440]   mentorship to help founders learn to grow their businesses.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.360]   And since 2008, he's hosted Startup Stories, a podcast where he's interviewed
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.080]   over 2000 entrepreneurs from Ryan Holiday to Robert Green.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   I've listened to many episodes in my days and it's a fantastic show, but
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   today we're actually going to talk about his book, Stop Asking Questions,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.840]   How to Lead High Impact Interviews and Learn Anything from Anyone.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.280]   But don't think that because you're not a podcast host or a professional
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.760]   interviewer, that this isn't for you.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.720]   We're going to learn how you can be a better, more interesting
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.640]   conversationalist in all kinds of settings, from networking to job
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.720]   interviews, to talking with friends and family.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.680]   We're going to talk about why this is a skill everyone should master and
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.040]   learn, what most people get wrong about how they ask questions, how to improve
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.840]   the kinds of questions you ask and why that's important, how to build rapport
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.560]   with people you've just met or don't even know anything about, and a lot more.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.360]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.640]   Andrew, thank you for being here.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640]   Welcome to the show.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.000]   Thanks for having me on Chris.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.600]   So I'm just going to jump in.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.280]   You named the book, Stop Asking Questions, but it's really
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.800]   about asking better questions.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.600]   I don't agree.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.440]   Can you talk about that?
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   How did you pick that name?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.720]   We think as interviewers and conversationalists that
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.000]   we need to ask questions.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.680]   And what I've discovered is that asking too many questions makes you
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.200]   seem needy and makes you feel like you're not really part of the conversation.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.440]   We should not be having question after question, be our style.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.760]   Our style should be a conversation that brings out what we're trying to learn,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.520]   brings out what our audience needs to learn.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.480]   And I find that questions often counteracts that.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.560]   Okay.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.200]   We talk about this in a professional setting.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.680]   You and I both record a lot of podcasts, you a lot more than me, but this is a
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.520]   skill regular people can use also, right?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.240]   Yes, dude.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.880]   How many times do parents try to get their kids to just tell them about
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.560]   their day, talk about a problem.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.320]   And then they pelt them with questions that are really
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   challenging for kids to answer.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.200]   Frankly, sometimes even just saying what'd you do today is challenging.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.240]   But if they say, I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.800]   And you say, because that one word will often get them to open up.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.960]   It's like these magical phrases that will work in any part of life.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   And if you see my interviews, you see, I will just throw in the word
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.280]   because interrupt someone sometimes.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.960]   And because I've done that, they will go into the depth and the reasons
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.840]   of what they did and why they did it.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.920]   And so that's what it's about.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.640]   Sometimes it's about asking a question.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   Sure.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.680]   But often it's not asking a question.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.760]   It's just a one word like transition that I've handed to them and they
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.960]   can't help, but use to explain why.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.880]   Why don't you want to go to school tomorrow is kind of challenging.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.880]   Now they're put on the spot.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.200]   They've said something.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.120]   And I say, because now there's an expectation that they're of course
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.920]   going to finish the sentence because my friend doesn't like me because my
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.640]   friend is moved on to first grade.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.680]   And I'm still in kindergarten, whatever it is, it comes out naturally.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.080]   Now, the reason that I wrote this book is because I found that a lot of people
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.520]   were doing interviews the way they were supposed to, which is I'm
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.800]   going to ask the best question.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.600]   Some people would even write the questions ahead of time, instead of being more
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.280]   present in the conversation and instead of saying, what's the best way to get
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   the most knowledge out of this person who I'm talking with and the best bonding.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.320]   And when you start with that, instead of how do I write the best questions, you
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.360]   end up with a deeper conversation that often involves you sharing and not
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.600]   asking the question, you making a statement, you directing the person.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   My first use case, I thought about this, that an average person might be
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.480]   preparing for an interview is in a job setting.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.360]   I'm looking for a job.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.000]   I'm going in.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.040]   I know at some point someone's going to say, all right, what
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.200]   questions do you have for me?
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.600]   My initial advice after reading your book was, well, you should have such a good
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.800]   conversation that you don't even leave time for the questions.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.080]   How would you advise someone thinking about that professional setting
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.120]   where they have time to prepare?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.520]   Okay.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.200]   Let me give you one.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.600]   What questions you have for me, the natural next step might be to say, how
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.640]   many hours do we work here, right?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.400]   Now you're coming across as a needy person trying to understand.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.640]   It's hard for me to say this, but if you keep asking questions, you come across as
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.760]   an inferior versus saying, now tell me about the hours at work here, talk a
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.320]   little bit about what's expected from us in our off hours, talk a little bit about
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.200]   how we connect to each other in the company instead of, so how do we connect
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.640]   each other?
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.720]   So what you're doing, and this is one example is directing the person.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.640]   Directing gives them the confidence that you can lead them, that you could lead
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.760]   them through the conversation and also that you can lead at the job.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.880]   And so that's a good example of me saying, shouldn't be a question.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   Sometimes you just need to make a statement, take control in my book.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.800]   Stop asking questions.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.840]   I gave the example of how my wife and my family went on these tours of national
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.200]   parks.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.360]   And if we would ever have a tour guide who would walk around and go, do you want
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.320]   to turn right or left?
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.440]   What do you like to see?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.960]   Do you like to see this track or that it's too much?
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.720]   You're the expert say, and now we're going to turn left because when we turn
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.840]   left, you're going to see what the bears have done here.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.520]   And if we turn right after that, you're going to see what's happened because we
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   haven't had enough water here in California.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.480]   Boom.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.560]   Now you got somebody who knows you, who you feel confident that they could lead
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.720]   you.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.920]   That's the way you need to be as an interviewer, as a conversationalist.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   And yes, like you said, somebody is about to get a job and they're being asked, do
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.640]   you have any questions for me?
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.160]   You don't have to specifically give a question, start directing them.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.520]   So for not asking as many questions, talk about how someone should prepare for
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.400]   conversations when they have advanced notice of who they're talking about in
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.840]   the topic.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   The best thing is to go deep.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.920]   This is going to be a little bit, woo, go deep in your heart and say, what the
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.480]   hell do I need to get out of this person?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.080]   What do I need to get out of this conversation?
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.520]   Not what does some imaginary audience member need to know?
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.960]   And I need to get, we don't need that imaginary audience member anymore.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.840]   It's, I have a problem.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   What do I want to understand from this person that I can't get from anywhere
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.320]   else?
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.040]   Go deep and say, ah, that's the thing that I need.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.520]   And if it's for your audience, the only way I think to get to your audience is to
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.760]   have a drink with your audience members or a meal or dinner with a few of them.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.080]   One at a time, ideally in small groups, if you can do one at a time and as often as
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.920]   you can, and then have them tell you their problems, let them find ways to get
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.520]   it out, have them tell you their problems.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   And specifically the ones you can't answer, feel that pain of having somebody
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.120]   come to you as the expert interviewer, as the expert business person is the expert,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.600]   whatever.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.160]   And they're asking you a question.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   You don't have the answer.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.400]   And then you say, be humble.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.080]   I don't know.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.480]   I'm going to do interviews and now I'm going to find out.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.800]   And now when you ask that question of somebody else, you're going to have a
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.200]   deep need to get the answer because you couldn't answer it because somebody you
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.560]   cared about who you had a meal with or a drink with asked you a question that you
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.360]   can't answer.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.080]   That's where it comes from.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.960]   And so the first thing to do is not to do research.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.880]   And I believe in doing research and I know you do too.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.480]   The first thing to do is not to write out a list of questions.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.880]   And a lot of interviewers do that.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.800]   We don't want to do that.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.200]   The first thing is to say, what do I need?
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.840]   What do I need?
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.960]   I just thought of an idea of what you just said.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.760]   Using this job interview example, start talking to your friend, talking to your
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.200]   spouse, talking to your family members about this job you're getting and see
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.840]   which questions that they have for you about the company that you can't answer
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.960]   and you wish you knew as a way to kind of generate ideas of what could be
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.360]   interesting.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.000]   Great one.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.720]   What about when you don't know someone there's practicing for a conversation,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.760]   you know, you're going to have, and then there's, I'm going to a
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.280]   cocktail party, I'm going to a conference.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.160]   I don't know who I'm going to meet or who they're going to be.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.240]   Is there a way to just build repetition or get your reps in for practicing
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.040]   conversational skills without any person that you know you're talking to?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.360]   Oh, I do that a lot.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.040]   First of all, if you don't know someone and you need like a hook in, the thing
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.600]   to do is to find out what are they really passionate about.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   And again, if you say, what are you passionate about?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.560]   I don't know.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.760]   It seems a little bit like 12 year olds going on a first date where they're
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.120]   pretending that they know what they're doing, but they don't like, it feels
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.560]   like the wonder years where the boy in there was trying to go on a date and
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.680]   you just get a lot of questions.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.080]   I think a better way to do it is I would think about what did I do
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.000]   that it was passionate about.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   So I might say, we just did some standup paddleboarding.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.640]   I never did it before.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.720]   We got this inflatable standup paddleboard, 230 bucks off of Amazon.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.800]   The thing is fricking good.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.760]   What's not good as me, I got on the paddleboard and I just kept going into
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.360]   these waves in the lake over here.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.680]   And the reason they're ways is that people go through a jet skis and boats.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.040]   And anyway, I'm falling off in their way and I lost my paddle,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.240]   but I bought a new one.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.600]   I'm so psyched to go back.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.040]   There's so many places here in Austin where you can go do it.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.960]   Anyway, I've talked too much.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.480]   What do you do this fun?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.840]   Or what are you doing around here that gets you this excited?
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.080]   Give him some direction after you've shared a little bit.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.560]   And by the way, as an interviewer, I thought I wasn't allowed
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.120]   to share my part of life.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.320]   I thought all I needed to do was be there for the other person.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.240]   But when I get this excited about what I'm doing, the other person can't help,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.120]   but say, oh yeah, my big thing is.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.760]   And then they go off on how they love going to water parks
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.480]   or they love lifting weights or whatever it is that they get into.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.760]   So that's the thing that I try to do.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   And then you talk about how do you get your reps in an experiment?
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   I absolutely do practice my question techniques in private
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.360]   when there's somebody that I meet and I don't think I'm ever going to meet them again.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.480]   I just throw out a question approach to see how will they respond.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.040]   I try to direct them.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.760]   Tell me what you were doing this weekend instead of.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.880]   So what were you doing this weekend and see what happens if I try it on someone
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.920]   in person and it doesn't feel awkward and I don't see a distance
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.880]   in the conversation, I think it's a good technique.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.920]   Keep it in my Google Doc full of techniques for having better conversations.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.400]   Tell me what else is in the Google Doc, right?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   You've got starting with tell me you use pausing and interrupting
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.080]   people saying because let them continue.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.600]   What other tactics work really well in this conversational flow?
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.080]   The one that started the whole thing for me was I, for years,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.360]   felt really bad because I asked Jason Fried,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.880]   the founder of Basecamp, how he failed, when he failed.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.920]   And he just kind of looked away.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.280]   I still see him right now as we're talking in my head, looking away and going,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.720]   well, sometimes we just don't have any setback.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.600]   Some things just don't have that.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.480]   And the more I push, the more he just acted
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.320]   or I felt that he acted like I was an idiot
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.440]   who always failed and couldn't understand that sometimes people don't just
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.840]   fall on their face when they're just trying to walk to the other end of the room.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.520]   Anyway, that ate away at me.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.680]   I asked him about his setback and he didn't give me an example.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.960]   And I kept pushing.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.040]   And the more I pushed, the more he resisted.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.800]   So I hired an interview coach and I gave him that specific example.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.160]   I said, look, Jeremy, before we talk about anything else,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.680]   I have to tell you about this one problem.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.360]   And I told him and he goes, oh,
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.880]   my therapist had a situation like that.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.480]   Go tell me, goes my therapist had a technique called join the resistance,
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.920]   says my therapist would have these men who would come into her office
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.600]   and she would say, OK, tell me about the problem you and your wife are facing.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.640]   And the husband would go, I don't have any problems, say,
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.360]   but you're clearly in here because you have a problem.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.480]   There's an issue in the relationship.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.120]   It's not me. It's her. I don't have any problem.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.440]   What are we doing here?
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   I don't know. She made me come.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.120]   And the more the therapist pushed, the more the person put up a resistance
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.880]   and then like sidestepped the whole problem.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.920]   So Jeremy's therapist said she decided to join the resistance
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.200]   if she said, tell me about the problem you and your wife are having.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.600]   And the person said, I'm not having any problem.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.880]   She would say, oh, must be good.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.680]   You know what? All I hear that people have problems.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.400]   It must be good for you to just have an easy going life without any problems.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.120]   Congratulations.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.960]   And then the person go easy.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.840]   All she does is she keeps complaining to me.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   And I don't know when we could spend time together
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.000]   because my work is now taking up a whole lot of time.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.400]   And I've never had to work this many hours, let alone this late in my career.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.040]   Now they were off on a conversation that mattered.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.960]   And so, Jeremy, my interview coach said, join the resistance.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:05.560]   Whenever you ask a guest a question and they resist, stop fighting with them.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:11.000]   Join the resistance. Say something like, well, it must be great to have an easy business.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.080]   Everyone else is struggling.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   It must be great to have an easy time building your company
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.320]   when the rest of us are working really hard.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.000]   When I say that, the person will immediately lash out at me and go hard.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.080]   I mean, you think this is easy?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.520]   You don't know.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.200]   Last night we were up because the servers were down.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.480]   And then somebody a week ago was complaining to me about the way
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.400]   that we are interacting at work.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   And I'm trying to get work done, not talk about what their interpersonal issues are.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.320]   Now we've got a real problem we can talk about.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.600]   So anyway, because the coach said, join the resistance.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.920]   And he gave me that phrase.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.960]   I wrote it down in a Google doc with that phrase.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.600]   And I said, oh, I'm going to remember this because it has a name.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.240]   And so I started to whenever I would have a new technique, I would give it a name
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.560]   and I'd add that technique to a Google doc.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.240]   Yeah, I saw the list in the book where there's like a directory of tactics.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.680]   So there are plenty more for anyone listening who wants more than we'll get to today.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   But you talk about building yourself up, not making yourself seem needy
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.800]   and asking questions when you're interviewing for a job
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.880]   or maybe you're doing references with someone's previous manager.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.680]   Can you still use those techniques to get people who are more guarded
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.320]   with information to share?
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.080]   I use it with people all the time.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.440]   I think sometimes people are guarded because they're modest,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.960]   because they're not jerks.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.800]   I used to in San Francisco have entrepreneurs come over for scotch at my office
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.680]   and they would just ask me all these questions and someone say,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.720]   how do you get people to give you their numbers?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.960]   And I said, well, what I do is I give them a dramatic lowball.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.560]   I said, what do you mean, dramatic lowball?
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.400]   I said, I had this woman on.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.600]   She wouldn't give me her revenue number.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.000]   So I said to her, and I knew that it was at least 10 million.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.560]   I said to her, do you think you'll hit a million soon?
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.680]   She was a million.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.560]   We're doing at least 10, 20 times that.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.320]   We're not trying to reach a million.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.360]   Anyway, I said that at scotch night and the guy goes, Oh, that's such a good technique.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.120]   If you go dramatic lowball, people feel insulted enough
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.160]   that they have to come back at you.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.800]   So we started talking about other things.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.880]   And when we're at scotch night at my office, we're tasting different scotches,
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   talking about what we're into.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.240]   And at one point we got into running and the guy said, So how much you run?
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.000]   I said, Yeah, I run as much as I can here and there.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.200]   And the guy goes, Andrew, do you think you'll get to run a marathon sometime?
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.600]   Maybe. And I go, a marathon sometime.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.240]   I've run more marathons than I can count.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.560]   Literally, there was one time in Washington, D.C.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.760]   My wife left me at the top of Rock Creek Park and I just ran all the way down.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.360]   That was over 30 miles.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.440]   And there was no other way for me to get home except to run back to the house.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.600]   So a marathon is nothing for me.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.760]   And then he was smiling and others around the scotch table were smiling, too.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.600]   And I couldn't understand why they were laughing at me at first.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.480]   I thought maybe they were laughing at me because that's not that much to run.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.800]   And then I realized he used dramatic lowball on me.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.560]   And so this works everywhere.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.800]   Yes, it works in interviews.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.920]   Yes, it works in private conversations.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.080]   It absolutely does.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.640]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.960]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.600]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.880]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.240]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.040]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.840]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.720]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.160]   you're wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.960]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.760]   And it's not just for men.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.400]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.000]   I think I have three pairs, and they are probably the most
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.800]   comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.600]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.880]   whether it's running, training or yoga.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.560]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.120]   or their meta pants can even work for a night out.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.480]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.680]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20 percent off
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.920]   your first purchase, as well as free shipping and returns

[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.640]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.720]   With over 100 classes from a range of world class instructors
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.080]   like Steph Curry, Richard Branson and Martin Scorsese,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.800]   that thing you've always wanted to do is way closer than you think.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.400]   When I signed up a few years ago, I jumped straight into an amazing
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.600]   cooking class by Thomas Keller that has totally leveled up
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.000]   my skills in the kitchen.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.880]   I also really enjoyed FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss's class
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.600]   on the art of negotiation.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.240]   And with every class I've taken, I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.160]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.480]   And a MasterClass membership makes such a good gift for someone
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.680]   that's hard to shop for.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.240]   I highly recommend you check it out.

[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.560]   Are there some examples of people you've talked to outside
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.120]   of the professional interviewing setting that after adopting these techniques
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.000]   have seen real tangible outcomes
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.320]   or improvements in their career or their life or their relationships?
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.800]   Yes, I was invited in when I first wrote the book to talk at a company.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.240]   It was called People.ai.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.920]   They said, oh, we're salespeople.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.880]   We need these techniques, too, because salespeople, if they do it well,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.120]   what they do is they ask questions.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.800]   And so they bought a copy of my book for each one of their salespeople,
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.320]   and then they invited me in to speak.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.120]   And then afterwards, I got messages from people about how they use these techniques.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.800]   There's one salesperson who said, Andrew, you want to know numbers
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.480]   because you're trying to create a podcast where you're revealing to your audience
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.680]   the revenue that your guest has.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.600]   He says, I need numbers because I want to know the extent of a problem.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.040]   I want to know, like, how much of an issue this is to figure out
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.920]   whether we can solve it or not.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.280]   It was what I do is I come in with a dramatic low ball.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.880]   I will use something like, well, it seems like you're maybe losing
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.000]   only a thousand dollars a month with this problem that you've told me about.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.960]   And the person will come and know it's more than a thousand dollars,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.640]   and then they'll start to fight back and explain how this is really costing
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.000]   the business half a million a year.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.160]   And now that the salesman knows the measurable pain of not solving it,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.880]   he can address how just spending a little bit of money on their software
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.120]   can help him alleviate that pain.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   Salespeople for sure use this.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.840]   What about at home?
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.240]   Do you use any of these tactics with family and friends
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.040]   when there's no business use case?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.200]   It's just trying to build deeper relationships with people
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.080]   you already know a bit about.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.720]   I do. I think the biggest one that I use is the word because
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.120]   the thing that happens in conversations is we say what happened is factual.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.600]   It's interesting, but it doesn't tell me why you're doing something, why it matters.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.000]   And the problem is, if I say, well,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.680]   tell me why you feel that way or tell me why you did that.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.920]   I'm putting you in this self-evaluation mode
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.080]   that you can't really tap into in a conversation.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.680]   Even with a therapist, you have a hard time doing it.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.880]   But if you're telling me that you did this and you did that, and I say because.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.600]   Now I'm just handing you the next word for you to have to respond to.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.440]   I'm almost insisting that you tell me I'm creating a gap
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   that you feel you have to fill in.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.200]   If I say because you feel like you have to pick that up and say, well,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.320]   because I wasn't feeling very good because I'm feeling this way that now
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.200]   you understand why.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.160]   So because it's an easy one to use with people.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.680]   You say in the book, people prefer to be heard more than to be helped.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.080]   I know my wife would agree sometimes in our conversations
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.320]   for people who have a natural tendency
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.680]   to jump in and help to try to solve a problem or interject.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.600]   Are there any ways that you found helpful to bite your tongue effectively?
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.000]   Maybe that's literally the answer for people that that's not natural for.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.480]   I have found that I don't take advice very well
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.000]   when it comes to problems that I don't recognize
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.640]   in an environment that I feel comfortable with.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.080]   So if you were to give me advice on how I could use my Mac better,
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.360]   maybe even about my business, I feel like, all right,
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.800]   I've heard it from so many people, I don't need it.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.080]   But we just moved to five acres in Austin.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.840]   I decided that I would get a circular saw
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.000]   so that I can cut wood and make it into a compost box.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.240]   I don't know how to even turn on a circular saw.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.440]   I literally didn't know how to put the blade in.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.240]   I don't know how to connect two pieces of wood together.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.320]   Turns out you have to drill a hole first and then put a screw into it.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.040]   And the videos I saw on YouTube, they were just putting a screw in.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   But I didn't realize there was a hole there before.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.160]   Anyway, I don't know any of it.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.440]   And so I'm ready to take advice better.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   I'm ready to be more of a learner and less of a know-it-all
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.040]   who's going to stop and interrupt you.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.840]   What I'm getting at is I think if anyone out there is in a very
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.720]   know-it-all place where they can't stop, but give people.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.440]   Answers and solve their problems that are listening to their problems,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.520]   get out of your own comfort zone, get into a place
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   where you don't know what you're talking about,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.680]   because there you're just going to shut up more
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.840]   and give direction and advice less, and it'll build a better habit for you.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.240]   And I think that if you do that, you're going to be much more open
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.760]   to listening to people and less to giving them advice.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.600]   You're going to be much more open to not knowing and looking for understanding.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.480]   And I think that I was blessed with Mixergy, my podcast of 15 years,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.080]   and that I really started it after I failed.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.840]   The thing that made it into a podcast was this video that I posted
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.800]   where I said I was starting a software company and I failed.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.960]   I'm going to do interviews with people to learn how to not fail this way again.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.480]   And if I've admitted to myself in the world that I failed,
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.800]   that I don't know how to do entrepreneurship the way that I wanted to,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.840]   the way that I thought I could.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.280]   Now, when someone came to me, I couldn't give them advice.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.440]   I just admitted I don't know everything.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.240]   I had to ask questions and learn.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.160]   I had to say I don't know enough, and that's why I'm interviewing these people.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.400]   Let me ask them.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.600]   And so what I would suggest is if you're talking too much,
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.880]   you need to get into an environment where you don't know enough.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.160]   And if it's in a relationship and the person you're with is a better runner,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.920]   go run with them.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.480]   If they're a better swimmer, go sign up for a swim with them.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.800]   If they're better at anything, if they're better at knitting,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.040]   go sign up for knitting class with them so that you are not the expert
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.400]   and you have to be the I don't know what I'm doing here.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.240]   This seems so foreign to me.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.600]   And you'll learn to listen and you'll learn to want other people to talk.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.960]   So back to your example of paddleboarding,
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.520]   if you're having that conversation with someone and you hear something come up
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.600]   about a topic you don't know and you want to try to build
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.040]   a more engaging conversation, just let them run.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.880]   It might help you shut up, which I know is something that has been effective
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.800]   for me in my career is just learning when to stop talking,
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.880]   which goes back to the title.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.400]   But let's go back to that example of productivity.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.600]   So you mentioned if you're going to have a conversation for an hour with me
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.000]   or anyone, and we were just going to talk about how to optimize using your Mac
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.120]   and moving windows around, which we actually just did in an episode
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.960]   a couple of weeks ago.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.680]   You might be like, I just don't want to be here.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.480]   But there are a lot of conversations that people get into
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.840]   where leaving is not the option.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.480]   So what do you do in those circumstances?
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.560]   Right. I'm about to talk to someone and I don't want to hear what they have to say.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.640]   Yeah. But you want to build a relationship with that person.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.960]   Oh, I just shifted to what I really care about.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.080]   There's so many times when you have to really go into a conversation
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   with people and you don't care.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.960]   I think it's OK to shift the conversation to what you genuinely do care about.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   What if it's clear that's what they want to talk about?
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.960]   Do you give it to them?
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.680]   Do you just kind of nod your head or have you found some way to harness
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.720]   interest in things people are talking about that
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.200]   at first glance are just not interesting?
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.720]   I was never able to have conversations with people.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.960]   I just didn't know the mechanics of conversations.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   Then I read a book called How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.000]   Carnegie, and the big message of it is take an interest in other people
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.440]   if you want them to like you.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.000]   So if they are interested in a thing, you talk to them about the thing.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.440]   And I was so moved by the book
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.800]   that I went and I knocked on Dale Carnegie and Associates office door.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.000]   And I said, I want to volunteer to work for you for free
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.400]   just to see how you live these principles.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.840]   And I learned it and I got good at it.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.320]   And then one day in college, I was going home with my friend Michael on.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.360]   I think it was the F train in New York.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.480]   And he started going off on these comic books that he was into.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.120]   What superhero he liked, how many of these comic books he had.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.960]   And all of that stuff that I couldn't care less about.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.920]   I was so bored.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.040]   He loved that I was taking an interest in him, and I would ask him questions like,
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.920]   well, why did you buy that one and how valuable do you think it is?
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.640]   And he loved it and I hated it.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.200]   And what I realized was if this is the epitome of success
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.440]   in the Dale Carnegie world, I don't want it.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.880]   I don't want a life where I'm sucked into conversations
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.760]   that don't mean anything to me and I'm pained by just so that other people like me.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.480]   There has to be a better way.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.040]   And what I've learned is I can shift the conversation to what I want it to be
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.960]   somewhere in the Venn diagram between what this person loves talking about
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.040]   and what I'm really eager to hear about is an overlap.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   And that's where I go.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.600]   And so today I would have asked, does your Russian father
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.480]   have a problem with you reading these comic books because he's so serious
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.120]   and there's a whole Russian culture of literature that matters more than this?
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.880]   And I would have gotten into his Russian experience.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.960]   I would have today asked him if he was worried that girls weren't into him
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.240]   because his head was in these stupid comic books all the time
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.160]   because I was wondering about that.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.840]   I would have asked a conversation that related to the comic books,
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.760]   but also to the thing that I cared about.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.120]   And that, I think, is the answer.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.040]   How do you do that?
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   I know you've read a lot of your transcripts to kind of build a muscle of, OK,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.560]   how am I doing this? What am I doing right?
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.600]   You've even probably hired people to review them.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.200]   Is there a version of that conversational review
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.040]   for people not in a professional setting?
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.600]   Is it recording business meetings, maybe with or without consent
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.760]   and listening to them?
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.760]   No, always do it with consent.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.880]   There's no reason for us to do it without consent.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.200]   But I will tell you how you get consent and then what to do with it.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.880]   The way you get consent is to recognize that the other person doesn't care
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.600]   that you want to study the way that you sell so you can sell to more people
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.800]   or study the way that you talk so you can talk to more people.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.920]   The other person wants to have notes on what they're doing.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.600]   So if you're doing a coaching call, can I record this coaching call
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.800]   so I know what it is that I said to you that's helpful?
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.160]   But I've coached people on like interviews and other things.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.880]   I will say, do you mind if I record this?
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.000]   Because I found that in the past, people want to see what I've said
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.160]   and they don't want to waste time writing it down.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.440]   This is helpful.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.040]   That is 100% useful to do.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.400]   So, yes, you can absolutely record with the other person's consent,
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.480]   but give them the reason, the incentive to have that call recorded.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.600]   Salespeople do this all the time.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.320]   There is this software that's used.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.920]   I'm actually going to interview the founder of it.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.520]   What they do is they record salespeople's conversations
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.880]   so that the salesperson can have an understanding of what she said
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.320]   that helped close the sale.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.080]   And then I will go through and analyze.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.480]   The thing is that outside of sales and interviewing,
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.520]   there just aren't enough people who care about conversations
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.960]   to do anything with it.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.160]   Too many people think conversations are just.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.920]   A thing you do instead of a thing you study to do well,
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.040]   you would never find people who are serious swimmers
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.880]   just hoping to go in the pool and figure out the way that they're supposed to swim.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.160]   You would never find a serious chess player saying, I'm just going to wing
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.320]   playing chess. They study it, they learn it.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.000]   And I think a lot of us go into conversations saying,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.400]   I'll just work on it and be better at it instead of studying
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.400]   the way they played before and then seeing what they could do better.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.920]   By the way, that software is called Wingman by Clary now.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.320]   So if you go to try wingman.com or salespeople know about this,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.040]   I don't need to tell them it will record their calls and then give them feedback on it.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.520]   Do you think someone could benefit in a situation
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.280]   where they don't feel comfortable asking or can't get permission?
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.080]   Is it debriefing in some particular way right after and taking notes
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.760]   or collecting feedback from the people you're speaking with?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.360]   Now, let's take the job interview example.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.200]   I imagine if you said, hey, can I record my interview with you?
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.960]   I can imagine a lot of companies being like, no, we don't let people record
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.800]   our job interviews, but it's a skill that I think a lot of people
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.160]   looking for jobs right now wish that they could review and see how they did.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.960]   Is it notes after? Is it asking feedback?
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   I think that studying it afterwards is a problem.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.320]   I mean, without a recording. And here's why.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.720]   I had this one interview that I brought back to my coach and I said,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.440]   look at this, I'm such a wuss in these calls.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.960]   That's what I mean. I said, look, all the people that I admire.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.400]   I remember at the time I told him Ramit Sethi is a great blogger.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.640]   He keeps talking about how great he is at saving money,
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.920]   how great he is at handling hot sauce in his mouth.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.760]   Like he talks about how great he is.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.280]   And that's what people want when they're reading these posts.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.120]   They want to see someone who loves themselves enough
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.920]   to talk about how great they are so that as readers,
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.120]   as followers of this person, they could want to be that great, too,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.040]   and be that happy with themselves.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.680]   And what do I do as an interviewer is I talk about the things
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.800]   that aren't working for me,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.320]   how I don't understand how I can systemize my business,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.920]   how I don't understand how I can hire better.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.120]   I keep talking about my problems and the guest talks about all their wins.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.960]   And look at this, I said in the transcript.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.480]   And my coach looked at the transcript and he just stopped talking to me.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.920]   Oh, this guy thinks that this question is not serious enough
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.480]   to take a look at or to consider.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.680]   He's just kind of off in his own world.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.160]   I just sat there feeling more miserable.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.480]   And then Jeremy says, Andrew, I think he said something like double
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.840]   click on my face, which in Google Docs means you could scroll to where
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.000]   the person is because, look, this is what you're talking about.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.680]   Go, yes, look at how I put myself down there by saying what I don't know.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.760]   He goes, now look at this double click on my face again.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.520]   I double click.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.520]   He took me down further in the transcript and he said
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.360]   she now is being open about her problem with her mom
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.440]   and how it led her to where she is and to be the kind of person she is.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.600]   He said, you are thinking you're going to get vulnerable
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.080]   and the other person will immediately be vulnerable back.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.240]   And when they don't, you feel like you're alone in your weakness
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.960]   and everybody else is a success.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.160]   What you don't realize is you start out with this vulnerability.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.600]   The person needs to process it.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.720]   And eventually they often feel comfortable sharing.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.360]   And look at how it is in black and white.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.000]   The reason I'm saying this to you, when we're trying to find non-obvious
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.080]   wins and losses in our conversations, it's really hard for us
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.240]   to evaluate ourselves. We just can't do it.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.400]   That's why when you see a stand up comic perform, you'll often see
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.880]   that they're recording themselves because they might think that a joke bomb.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.640]   But in reality, there was a hint of a laugh that they didn't realize
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.280]   because they were feeling vulnerable and insecure about that joke.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.880]   They need to see it afterwards, not when they're in performance mode,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.600]   but when they're in evaluation mode and performance mode.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.440]   You are much harder on yourself in evaluation mode.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.280]   You can go much more cerebral.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   So coming back to the job interview, I would suggest to you
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.480]   that there are a lot of people who could say,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.800]   I want to record this conversation so that I have notes for how to follow up
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.120]   on this.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.840]   What I've discovered is that you're going to teach me a lot about your company.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.120]   And if I start to write it down because I want to learn it,
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.920]   I'm not going to have it afterwards.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.200]   But if I record it and I give both of us notes on it,
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.640]   I'm going to have something that I could follow up on.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.480]   I would suggest to you that something like that is really helpful for people
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.160]   to say, I'm going to record what we're doing because I found that
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.800]   a lot of people, when they do interviews with me, aren't aware of
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.960]   or maybe sometimes I don't express everything right.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.440]   And I want to fact check it for you.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.560]   So if I have a recording, I can go back and I could look at it.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.960]   Give them the wind, tell them why it's important.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.840]   And people will be willing to do it.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.680]   Now, if that's not an option, I should tell you that
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.360]   one thing that I've done is I will record my side of the conversation.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.640]   I don't need the other person necessarily.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.840]   I can just say I'm recording this so that I have my own voice.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.280]   And I think that helps. It's not ideal.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.240]   I prefer to see both, but I think there's a way to follow up.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.480]   So as one, if you're doing that, make it clear
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.280]   that you're not going to be doing anything with the audio.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.440]   You're not going to be sharing the audio publicly, right?
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.040]   It might seem obvious, but I think that's something to add.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.720]   And the other I was thinking, gosh, how would you just record one person?
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.920]   Then I was just thinking right now, oh, I've headphones on.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.080]   If I had my iPhone right now recording in this room.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   So if you're doing a zoom call, throw some headphones on.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.280]   If you're watching this on the YouTube channel,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.880]   you could see that Andrew has headphones on and doesn't look like it.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.680]   I have headphones on and look like it.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.880]   He's got the better headphones set up here from discreteness.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.040]   But I think those are both great.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.240]   Chris, there's one other thing that I think is worth noticing.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.800]   When I started Mixergy, I was in Southern California,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.640]   Santa Monica, even Santa Barbara, that whole little stretch
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.240]   has venture capitalists.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.520]   But the elite venture capitalists were always in San Francisco,
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.640]   and it was just a short ride away.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.560]   So many entrepreneurs go there.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.920]   What I noticed having dinner with entrepreneurs is they would often go
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   and have meetings with the local VCs, the locals who are newer,
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.200]   less likely to give them money, less likely to be the ones
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.840]   that they wanted to take money from.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.080]   And around the table, when someone would say,
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.840]   why did you take a meeting with this person instead of going up to San Francisco?
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.680]   Sometimes the response would be I needed the practice.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.280]   I wanted somebody who was going to question me.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.160]   I wanted to get my story and they would practice with them.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.120]   And the reason I bring this up is because if you're trying to improve
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.200]   your conversations, if you're trying to improve the way you do job interviews,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.800]   you can go out for practice with people who you're not as concerned about.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.000]   Maybe there's a third tier job that you are thinking about
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.560]   or you would never even consider.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.880]   Go take the interview and then try some of the techniques that I'm suggesting.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   Try some of the conversation techniques.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.440]   Try to ask them to record.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.720]   Get comfortable with it.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.600]   You're in some ways going to feel superior.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   And you'll say in yourself, I deserve to be able to record this.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   Of course, this makes sense.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.280]   I'm going to record it so I can follow up with them.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.360]   And then you'll feel better about it.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.800]   Once you do it there, you're going to feel better about doing it somewhere else.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   So I think that's a huge, huge win.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.080]   It kind of makes me want to go to a networking event for something
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.800]   that I have no professional designations for.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.360]   Like, let's go to the veterinary networking event in the Bay Area
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.720]   and just go talk to people in a totally different industry.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.560]   Obviously, I won't be the expert.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.960]   I got to go find out where they are.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.600]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.080]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.880]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.920]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.360]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.400]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.480]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.640]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.120]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.800]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.880]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.920]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.880]   on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.280]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.560]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.920]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.840]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.200]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.440]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.320]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.040]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts from our partners,
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.240]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.640]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.480]   If we rewind, you were talking about vulnerability,
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.600]   but I don't think you unlocked why it can be so valuable.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.920]   So I'm going to give you a little bit of your vulnerability
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.840]   can be an awesome skill in conversations, because I'll let you finish that.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.080]   First of all, I think we get a benefit in talking about it
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.520]   to see that it's OK to say that
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.400]   my family had some mental health issues or someone in our family did
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.920]   and how it just really wrecked the family to know that somebody is going through that.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.600]   That's a share that you can see my voice is still not.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.800]   You can still hear my voice, how I'm not fully comfortable talking about it, but
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.520]   by sharing it, by talking about it,
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.640]   I release some of the pain that I have around it.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.760]   I also connect with other people who are having it.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.560]   And then it gives the other person an opportunity to say, oh, it's safe
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.040]   to say this, to talk about their suicide attempt in their family,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.280]   their mental health issues.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.080]   So I think if we really want to get to know the other person,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.600]   we have to show them some of ours. Otherwise, people won't do it.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.720]   They'll feel like you're taking advantage of them.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.360]   I talk a lot about money on the show,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.680]   and I find that money is one of those places where people are very guarded.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.960]   People don't talk about it.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.960]   And so I often just open up and just say, oh, here's how much we spent on this thing
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.520]   or here's this situation, and that helps.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.400]   Another tactic that I picked up from you was
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.760]   asking them permission to ask them the uncomfortable question.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.240]   Yeah, I think the way you frame in the book and tell me if I'm correct.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.200]   Is it OK if I ask you, which is two questions in one?
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:39.320]   And people will answer the easiest of the two questions.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.600]   Whenever there are two questions,
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.120]   they will immediately go and take the easy answer.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.720]   So is it OK if I ask you if you and your wife are still married?
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.520]   If they don't feel comfortable saying that they're not married,
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.400]   they'll say, no, it's not OK or no, I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.120]   You just ask them that question. Is it OK if I ask you?
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.040]   Is it OK if I ask you what your revenue is?
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.720]   Do you feel comfortable revealing your revenue?
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.800]   Those types of things are giving the other person an opportunity
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.000]   to take a graceful exit.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.240]   And I've seen this used by other interviewers,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.400]   and I have transcripts of myself using it.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.480]   And you will see that people will reveal things that you didn't expect
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.000]   because you've created that environment where they get to choose
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.440]   whether they answer or not.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.400]   And you'll also, if you see my transcript, see that some people will say,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.680]   no, I don't feel comfortable answering that.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.240]   I'll ask, do you feel comfortable talking about your revenue?
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.440]   And they'll say, no, I don't feel comfortable talking about that.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.200]   And we can move on.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.920]   And there isn't that awkwardness in the middle.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.880]   So I did this mistakenly on an episode that will have by the time
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.560]   this airs already come out, where I was asking Adam Levin,
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.160]   who runs a podcast called What the Hack, and it's all about cybersecurity
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.760]   and fraud and identity theft.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.680]   I wanted specific recommendations for places to go to monitor
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.080]   your identity and credit because there's just so many sites.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.680]   I didn't trust him.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.240]   And at first answer, I asked him and he said,
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.720]   I don't like to give recommendations.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.600]   And then later in the conversation, I said something like, OK, well, then.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.360]   Who should we avoid?
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.000]   Like, if you don't want to tell me who to pick, who should we avoid?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.840]   And that broke him down.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.240]   And he said, you know what?
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.200]   I said, I don't like to do this, but these three guys are really good.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   You should check these out.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.160]   So I'm curious if I had said, is it OK if I ask you
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.040]   to recommend a few companies that you think are really good?
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.720]   His answer would have been no.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   Eventually, I found out that he was willing to share more.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.960]   Are there any ways to get a sense of whether you've gotten someone to open up
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.200]   and revisit something that you thought might have been
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.360]   they weren't willing to share, but might be now?
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.440]   The thing that I think about when you say that is I would write that down.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.160]   I would analyze why that question worked, write it down and then try it again.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.640]   And then if it works, add it to the repertoire.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.080]   I think that's an interesting approach.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.840]   You've asked him a tough question.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.720]   He didn't answer it.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.000]   And then you ask him an even tougher question.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.240]   And suddenly the first one seems easy.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.400]   And so he might come in.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.560]   That might be why it works.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.400]   I would try it in conversations in private to see if that worked.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.600]   And if it didn't, then I discarded.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.320]   If it does, it goes on to a Google talk for me.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.720]   And that's what I use.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   I think that's important to analyze.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.760]   You're asking me if there are other ways to get at it.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.080]   I think that one way to get at it is to say, I don't need the exact.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.720]   I need a ballpark.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.640]   So if I try to ask someone what their revenue is and they don't feel comfortable,
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.800]   I say you feel comfortable giving me a ballpark.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.240]   Like, is it millions is tens of millions is a thousand.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.040]   OK, sometimes people will say, OK, I feel comfortable with the ballpark.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.520]   I just don't want you to get the exact number.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.080]   Great. Sometimes I hit him with the dramatic low ball.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.360]   If in your situation, my approach might have been to say
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.440]   if I asked him which three companies I should work with and he didn't give me
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   the answer, my way would have been to suggest a really bad one.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.320]   Oh, you want to get.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.200]   And then I give him some clearly bad example and have him go, No, are you kidding me?
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.480]   That's absolutely the worst company.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.880]   If you want someone, just go at least use this other company.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.280]   And then that approach would work.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.840]   So there are a few different ways.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.880]   But I think the bigger point here is you've just discovered
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.960]   a new approach to asking question, and I would keep an eye on that
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.440]   and see if you can use it multiple times.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.760]   And that's the way that I added to my repertoire.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.120]   This whole book was written on me
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.000]   discovering these ways of asking questions that worked and then writing them down.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I would always give them a name.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.760]   I would write them down
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.720]   and then I would copy out of the transcript why they worked.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.320]   I have another one I'll add to my repertoire.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.280]   I'm not going to share it now.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.640]   I got to go test it first.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.800]   So if you're listening, maybe you'll hear me bring it up some more.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.560]   We talked a lot about the questions you ask, the questions you don't ask,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.000]   the ways you interrupt.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   What about at the end?
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.480]   Is there anything about how you build a relationship
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.880]   and then follow up on that relationship, whether it's wrapping up
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.440]   the conversation or following up after that you think has helped?
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.080]   Oh, Chris, I've been so bad at that.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.240]   Like, I will meet these amazing people, have phenomenal conversations,
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.080]   and then I won't do anything about it.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.080]   And then we're gone from each other's lives after the person loves me.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.760]   Or at least we connected.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.000]   I love chess.com.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   I am on it all the time.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.200]   I keep analyzing my chess game.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.720]   I interviewed the founder of chess.com.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.240]   We hit it off.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.640]   He was texting me questions like, can we buy an ad on your podcast?
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.400]   I said, I'm sorry, I've run out of space.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.040]   Anyway, when we were into that kind of a thing,
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.840]   we chatted and then the whole thing disappeared.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.840]   I happen to be in therapy recently.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.560]   And one of the things that I uncovered was that I am not a great
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.520]   stay in touch with someone person,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.960]   like even the people that I work with, my producer, Ari Dusermo,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.120]   we worked together for a decade, I think somewhere around there.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.760]   And I won't just say, here's what I'm up to or check in
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.960]   and see how is it going with the kids or anything like that.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.240]   And he said, Andrew, people want to hear from you.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:35.600]   They don't.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.400]   I said, all right, I'm going to try it because I want to hear from you.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.320]   I go, OK, I'm going to try it.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.000]   You're my therapist.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   You're saying I should hear from you.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.080]   I have your number because we do this on FaceTime.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.120]   And when I discovered something like how to drive a lawnmower here in Austin,
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.160]   I've never mowed a lawn before I moved to Austin.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.320]   I've always been a city person.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.480]   So I discovered how to drive a driving lawnmower and how to change a blade.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.440]   I sent him a picture.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.880]   I saw that he got excited about it, and I kind of like that touch point.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.840]   So then I started doing that with other people.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.560]   I would just send them a picture of the thing that I've learned to do.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.200]   And it might be some random thing like, hey, I just got this guitar
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.320]   that I've been traveling to Europe with. It's kind of fun.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.840]   What are you up to, by the way?
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.480]   And these little experiences that I'm sending in just a picture, nothing more.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.920]   They're super personal and they're an easy way to connect.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.440]   And I wish I'd done it more.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.760]   And so if I were to answer your question, honestly, it would be
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.640]   I sucked at it for years.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.880]   I'm getting better at it.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.720]   And my solution is to not try to find more work related things to say to someone,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.400]   but to instead just find a few personal things and share it with them.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   And one of the producers at Mixergy that I've had, like the first one,
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.800]   Jeremy Weiss, is amazing with it.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.680]   He will send me holiday text messages.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.320]   He'll send me random text messages about the date night he had with his wife.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.120]   And at times it feels, oh, I don't care about where you and your wife went,
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.560]   but never bothered by it because we're staying in each other's lives
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.120]   and it's incredibly effective.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.520]   So that's the one thing that I've learned to do.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.360]   And if I were to just add one other thing that's a little less harsh on myself,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.240]   but recognizing one thing that I randomly have done that works is.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.440]   I still have the same email inbox from forever,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.080]   and if I've ever interviewed somebody, our initial conversation is in that inbox.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.600]   So the founder of Dropbox, I have the first message where he said,
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.760]   yeah, I'll do the interview with you, Airbnb, and then other people
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.080]   who you may not know, but who matter to me.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.200]   If I need to reach out to them, I hit reply on that old message.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.520]   It gives them a sense of who we are and then it's easier to reconnect.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.800]   I'm not just somebody who needs something from you now.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.760]   I've connected with you.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.680]   I've helped you before through this podcast.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.360]   Now I'm checking in or asking for something.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.840]   Yeah, I don't know if you know Nick Gray, who's a fellow Austin local,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.840]   but he creates a friend's newsletter, which I've done in the past,
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.960]   which is like a scalable version of your lawnmower example,
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.560]   which is, you know, he sends an email out.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.720]   I think now it's weekly, but you could do it once a month.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.400]   It's just, hey, here's what's up in my life.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.680]   And I've actually noticed that the All The Hacks newsletter
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   that I ship out every month just last week, someone who I went to college
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.240]   with and haven't talked to in forever, but because I merged it
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.560]   from an email list I had before, wrote back and said, oh, my gosh,
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.400]   I've been staying in touch with you for all this long.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.160]   This is what I'm up to.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.720]   And it kind of brought us back together.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.560]   I would have never thought to text that person a picture of something,
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.240]   but to put them on an email that I send to everyone I did do.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:19.840]   And it worked.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.880]   So I said at the beginning, I wasn't going to spend too much time
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.400]   focused on just professional interviewing and all of that,
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.000]   because most people listening, this is not a podcast for podcasters.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.920]   But I know the listeners of this show have a pretty vested interest
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.040]   in the continuing evolution of this show.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.760]   So I am curious to get your take on a few things.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.600]   You've done over 2000 episodes and built a pretty big community around it.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.720]   How do you engage your listeners or advice for me to engage people
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.240]   listening today in the process of finding, recruiting and preparing for guests
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.960]   and kind of make it something that more people are involved in
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.640]   than just me and then publishing?
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.680]   I think podcasting is such a one way experience in many ways.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.760]   You can maybe get an email or review, but I feel like there's more opportunity there.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.400]   I was just at a conference that Nathan Lotka put on.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.160]   He asked me to go and introduce a speaker,
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.080]   and then he introduced me before I introduced the speaker.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.320]   And he said, Andrew once gave his cell phone number out on his podcast.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.800]   I said, there's no way that's really Andrew's number.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.160]   So I called it because I called it and it was Andrew.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.240]   And he picked up and I was in college and we talked.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.920]   And I said, that is an amazing thing that he would actually do it.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.200]   And he said, we've stayed in touch since then.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.520]   And it's been about 10 years now.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.760]   And the reason that I say that is I think we think a lot about
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.320]   how do we talk and engage our whole audience en masse.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.080]   And what I've discovered is that if we could just talk to them one on one,
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.720]   that's where the real value is.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.480]   The big thing I wouldn't get rid of if I absolutely need the broad reach.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.840]   But the more one on one that I could do, the better without killing myself,
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.000]   the more in person that I can do, or I spend time with you in the same room
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.280]   and we have a personal conversation, the better.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.200]   So scotch night was a good way to make my cell phone available.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.800]   It was a good way to say, here's my email address and anyone can reach out to me
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.360]   and then respond to people is a good way of reaching out to them.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.520]   The problem people come up with is what if too many people reach out to me?
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.760]   And that's a definite problem.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.640]   And I've run into that over the years.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:27.320]   But if you care about the people you're reaching, it's worth it.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.240]   And if you don't, then you have a real problem.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.720]   Like I could never be some of these YouTube stars
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:37.880]   who are writing about how to use, I don't know, just any random thing.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.680]   I need to care about the people who are out there enough
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.400]   that I would want to spend time with them,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.560]   not enough to just make a profit off of them.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.040]   And once I do that, then I want them to reach out to me.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.160]   I may not give my cell phone out anymore,
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.040]   but I'll get my email address out and respond.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.760]   And if I see someone on the street, I'll stop and we'll say hi.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.280]   And I think that's the best answer to reach an audience
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.920]   you genuinely care about and not just one that you need more of
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.200]   and be as open to personal one on one conversations
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.320]   and in-person meetings as you possibly can.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.720]   Yeah, I think anyone listening who's emailed me
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.360]   knows that I would like to assume that all of them have gotten a reply.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.880]   And as the show grows, maybe that reply is taken longer.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.160]   But often it starts with a question.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.320]   And then sometimes I follow up with a conversation
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.120]   trying to understand what do you think of the show?
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.000]   What direction would you want to take it?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.600]   So keep those emails coming.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.400]   Even if you don't have a question, feel free to reach out and let me know
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.280]   what you think about the show, where it should go, other things like that.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.080]   I'm always looking to improve and adapt.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.440]   Can I add to that and say,
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.800]   I think it's important that people also take that part of it,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.560]   that we keep talking about how we, if we get inbound, respond,
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.640]   we should be responding to as many people as possible.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.080]   I think people should also send out as many messages as possible.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.800]   There's this entrepreneur who I've invested in, Matt.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:57.400]   Matt reached out to the real founder of Netflix, Mark Randolph,
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:02.320]   and he got a frickin response back and then Mark Randolph became his advisor.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.400]   And then in the book that talks about the story
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.640]   of how Netflix was really founded by Mark Randolph,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.240]   there's a reference to Matt in the frickin book.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.600]   And then I asked Mark Randolph, the founder of Netflix, I said,
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.360]   is Matt Morales really like how do you connect with him?
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.920]   Is he someone who you really are advising over the years?
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.400]   He said, yeah, he just reached out to me and I care about entrepreneurs.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.440]   I responded back to him.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.120]   And in fact, I invested in his latest business, Oasis, and he's a good person.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.600]   I go from one frickin email out of the blue.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.840]   I think I think people are too intimidated to reach out.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.240]   And it's a problem.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.200]   We should also be reaching out to strangers whose work we like on the Internet
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.840]   and tell them why we like it, because they're trying to establish
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.160]   a relationship with their audience, too, and with people they care about.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.400]   I found that from the case of reaching out to people who I just sent you a DM
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.160]   and said, hey, like your work, can we have this conversation?
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.120]   I've sent those DMs to other people.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.000]   Some of them say no. Some of them say yes.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.400]   I found recruiting people to come on the show,
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.760]   trying to get interesting people to talk to.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.480]   Half the time, it's just a numbers game, right?
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.040]   You just have to send out enough messages that you can get someone
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.640]   on the time that they're looking at their email on the week.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.520]   They're not too busy.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.520]   And I think people should also be just trying more to get in front of people.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.560]   Dude, also, a no is good.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.080]   A no is good. You've stayed in touch with them.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.280]   I started Mixergy by organizing events.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.640]   I would go and invite people to an event who wouldn't show up.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.200]   But nobody said that jerk Andrew invited me to an event.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.600]   Instead, they go, oh, that's a guy who invited me to an event.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.360]   I better stay nice with him, because maybe the next time he invites me,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.280]   it'll be to an event that I care about.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.000]   If you invite someone to do an interview, there's nobody who goes that jerk
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.760]   Chris invited me to do a podcast interview.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.560]   He cares about me.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.880]   No, just inviting people, even if they say no.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.160]   It's a sincere way of saying I care about you.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.520]   I'm here reaching out to you before I really even need something.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.120]   I'm inviting you to do this thing to get exposure for your book.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.600]   In this case, to get exposure for your business.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.240]   In the case of me asking somebody to do an interview with me,
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.960]   it's never a loss to just invite somebody.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   And you talk about Nick Gray.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.160]   He's organizing events all over Austin.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.000]   He's constantly inviting people and people can't make it out.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.040]   But he's got this reputation now for inviting people to events
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.440]   that creates a warm feeling, the frickin guy.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.600]   I moved to Austin.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.280]   He invites me to go paddleboarding.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.120]   Now that I think about it,
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.800]   I must have done stand up paddleboarding with him.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.960]   That was my first time.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.520]   He invites me out stand up paddleboarding while we're there.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.720]   He goes, You know, Andrew,
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.640]   if you and your wife want to just go and experience Austin,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.720]   there's nothing like a paddleboard together.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.920]   Just come on over, borrow my stand up paddleboard and you and Olivia can go out.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:32.920]   You'll love it.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.800]   I've never taken him up on it because with paddleboards costing what?
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.640]   Two hundred fifty bucks.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.600]   I don't need to use his for free and then worry about damaging it.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.880]   But dude, the fact that he invited me to use it
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.840]   make me feel that he is a caring person
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.960]   who is offering me something that's that's that personal.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   Never a bad idea to invite people.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.200]   OK, I'm actually going to interrupt and add something
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.480]   that I didn't include in the interview after we stopped rolling.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.640]   Andrew suggested that I share some of the ways you all could help out with the show.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.320]   So I'm briefly going to do that.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.040]   The first thing is suggesting and helping me recruit guests.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.720]   Many of you have sent names in, so please keep those ideas coming.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.240]   It is so helpful.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.880]   But where I could really use your help is trying to get ahold
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.680]   of some specific people that I'd love to have on the show.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.560]   So if you happen to know them, that's incredible.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:27.120]   But even if not, if you want to tag them and me on Twitter
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.920]   or other social media or email them through their contact page
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.080]   and tell them you love the show and would love to see them on as a guest,
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.040]   it would be so helpful.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.840]   I'll put the list and links to each of them in the show notes.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.280]   But my top dozen people I would love to get in touch with are Bill Perkins,
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.840]   author of Die With Zero, to talk about getting the most out of your money.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.280]   Ray Dalio to talk about his principles for life and work.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.840]   Matt Walker to talk about sleep.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.360]   Jim Quick to talk about brain hacks.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.440]   My favorite parenting author, Emily Oster, to talk about having and raising kids.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.520]   David Sinclair to talk about health and longevity.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.240]   Ryan Holiday to talk about stoicism.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.840]   Sam Harris to talk about meditation.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.600]   Jay Shetty to talk about thinking like a monk.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.280]   James Clear to talk about habits.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.840]   Simon Sinek to talk leadership.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.040]   Brené Brown to talk courage, vulnerability and more.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.760]   And Tony Robbins to talk performance, psychology and money.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.480]   So that's actually 13.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.640]   But feel free to add anyone to the list that you think I missed.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.360]   And as long as we're here, I might as well swing for the fences
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.960]   and see if anyone's connected to Michelle or Barack Obama,
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.120]   because I would love to have them on as well.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.160]   So thank you all in advance.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   I'm going to find something cool to do for anyone who can help make these happen.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.680]   And it won't just be a sticker or something, though.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.800]   To be clear, it's also not going to be a vacation.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.480]   So somewhere in between.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.960]   OK, that's guess I'll keep my other two asks very brief.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.040]   First, I have a bunch of video from the YouTube videos of the podcast.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.520]   And I would love to find someone who knows what they're doing
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.520]   when it comes to cutting and clips, overlaying graphics and more.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:07.040]   So I can put those videos out on IG Reels, Tick-Tock and YouTube shorts.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.920]   And finally, I would love to find someone really adept with CSS
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.040]   to help me spruce up the All The Hacks website.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.640]   And just to be clear, both of those projects would be paid projects.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.760]   OK, thank you so much for supporting me in the show.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.600]   Let's get back to wrap up my conversation with Andrew.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.120]   OK, this has been fantastic.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.920]   I feel like I have a lot of homework
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.360]   so that the next time I'm interviewing someone, I'm doing a better job.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.600]   I'm asking the right questions.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.240]   I'm pausing, I'm interrupting and everything.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.040]   So thank you.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:38.080]   Hopefully everyone listening will thank you as the quality of the show goes up
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.920]   and the quality of my skills do.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.800]   I'm excited to engage with the audience more.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.120]   So if you're listening, reach out anytime.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.800]   Andrew, where can people find out what you're up to and everything you're working on?
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.080]   If you Google me, I'm totally Googleable.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.240]   Sorry to every other Andrew Warner on the planet, but I got there first.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.600]   Number two, the podcast, if they're curious about how I do my interviews,
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.440]   it's called Mixergy and the book Stop Asking Questions available at libraries and bookstores.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.960]   Oh, I've never heard the plug for libraries, so I appreciate that.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.640]   Everyone that listening knows library extension to take advantage of their library as well.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.320]   So, oh, dude, Chris, Libby app is amazing for that.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.880]   There's so many books that I would never think to buy.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.640]   Wouldn't even think to get the chapter to download.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:23.720]   Then I use the Libby app and I get the book directly sent to my Kindle
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.680]   and then the audio book directly on my phone to listen to.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.000]   And now because it's just you don't think about the price,
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.880]   you're just kind of experimenting.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.560]   I might take a few and start reading books that I never would have before.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.120]   You know about library extension?
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.320]   No, what's library extension?
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.160]   I thought that was for everyone listening to me.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:40.920]   Library extension.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:46.240]   So Libby is like 30% of library extension, but library extension is a Chrome extension
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.560]   that when you're on Amazon looking at a book, it just pops up and says,
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.960]   hey, you can get this at any of these local libraries.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.480]   And if you live in a metro area or I have my San Francisco library card
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.960]   and I've got my Berlin game library card and in order to join
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.240]   Stanford Federal Credit Union, I had to join the Friends of the Palo Alto Library.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.920]   So like I have a couple of library memberships
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.880]   and it just searches all of them from any Amazon page for a book.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.800]   Oh, that's great.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.880]   There's a little hack for everyone on the way out.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.040]   Andrew, thank you so much for being here.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:14.640]   Thanks, Chris.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.200]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.960]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.800]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.240]   in Apple Podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.240]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say hi,
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.400]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com or @Hutchins on Twitter.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.600]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
