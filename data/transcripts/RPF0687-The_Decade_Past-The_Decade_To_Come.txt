[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:28.640]   The obvious example of that, the Jewish Bar Mitzvah Bat Mitzvah was not always just a religious ceremony with no actual meaning. It was a rite of adulthood, a rite of passage. You can find some tribes of Indians who would have rites of passage into manhood at 13 years old. And then if you think about what happens physiologically for a child in their teens, in the US we call it adolescence, but it's a term that's denoting major changes and those changes are not just the changes that are being made in the world.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   It's a rite of passage into adulthood where I want to treat them in many ways as adults starting from about those early teenage years.

[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:13.680]   So in the coming decade, I'm going to build a much bigger business, hire more people to work with me, to expand my ability to keep me working in my unique ability and to expand out or to deliver more excellence.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.800]   I want people to get results faster.

[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:53.560]   I'm not going to play small. I am devoted to doing as much as I can to serve as many people as I'm capable of. Just with the skills and abilities that I have.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:08:03.920]   I still struggle to figure out the progression of how to do those things. I don't want to...
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:30.180]   I've learned as I get older, I'm learning to be more careful with the words that come out of my mouth. The classic entrepreneur problem is having a billion ideas and not being able to execute on them. And that's been always the challenge of my life is so many ideas. And then I struggle to execute, mostly because I haven't built the right team that helps me to execute on them. And I get embarrassed when I say, "Hey, look, here's this great idea. Here's this thing I'm going to do." And then I don't execute on it. So I'm going to...
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:33.940]   I was going to talk about kind of what I was doing.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:33.960]   And then I was going to talk about what I was doing. And then I don't execute on it. So I'm going to...
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:09:04.000]  , I'm going to do over the next years, but I'm just going to be quiet on that for now and work a focus on executing and not talking about stuff. So we'll see. I don't, if I think about a decade, I don't think I actually, I don't think I'll be doing radical personal finance a decade from now. I just don't think I will. My goal is to do is to create something and I'm still a year, probably a year away from my thousandth episode. But my goal is to create something
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   I'm still a year, probably a year away from my thousandth episode. But my goal is to create something and I'm still a year away from my thousandth episode.

[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.500]   it's just really exciting to feel that way and when i think about the phase that
