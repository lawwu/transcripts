[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600]   It is New Year's Eve, 2019.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.340]   Today closes out a year and also a decade.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.140]   And probably as you're listening to this,
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.640]   we're opening up into a brand new year
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.140]   and a brand new decade.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.280]   And I am an unabashed fan.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.780]   The turnings of the years,
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.780]   just the marking of the seasons,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.760]   I really enjoy that.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.160]   My birthday is in June.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.120]   And so I have this really mathematically organized life
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.000]   where I'm always looking forward
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.900]   either to my calendar year achievements and goals,
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.700]   or I'm looking forward to my birthday year
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.900]   achievements and goals.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.280]   And in fact, I actually have the blessing
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   of having an even more organized life
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.980]   in that my years line up quite nicely
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.880]   with big round numbers in five-year increments.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.420]   I'll turn 35 this year.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.920]   And so on the 2020, the decade markers,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.120]   I have a nice round five-year birthday.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.920]   And then my big decade birthdays come right
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.860]   in the middle of the chronological decade.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.460]   So I think very much in terms of these five
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.540]   and 10-year increments,
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.460]   one year, five year, 10-year increments.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.000]   And over the last few days, as I've encouraged you to do,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.740]   I have, together with my wife,
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.540]   we've been reflecting back on the last 10 years.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.600]   And I gotta say, I didn't expect it to be as much fun
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.640]   as it is, and it has been.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.080]   For us, it's been a really joyful decade.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.180]   And I knew that we had done some cool stuff
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.860]   in the last 10 years.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.060]   I knew that we were living our best life
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.020]   and just really a lot of things are going well.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.720]   We've had a whole lot of challenges,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.900]   but a lot of things have gone really, really well.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.260]   And I knew that, but it wasn't until we sat down
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.800]   and really made a list,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.840]   when I realized just how incredibly productive
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.700]   the last decade has been for me and for my family.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.700]   It's been awesome.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.420]   And that has helped to give me just a lot more confidence
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.240]   going into the next decade.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.120]   It's helped me to dream bigger dreams
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.320]   for the next decade than I was previously.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.460]   And it's helped me to feel like I can really accomplish
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.560]   some really cool stuff in the next decade.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.120]   I am constantly missing short-term
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   or short timeline goals, deadlines, targets, et cetera.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   I'm forever failing on accomplishing things
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.000]   in the short term.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.640]   Almost every single day, my to-do list is longer
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   than I can ever get accomplished.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.340]   Almost every single week, there's far more
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.540]   that I wanted to get done than I actually got done.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.660]   And so, I knew this intellectually,
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.960]   but just even the last few days, I experienced afresh
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   how what actually is happens is that I focus
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.040]   on the failures of the short term
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.920]   and I don't zoom out to appreciate the major progress
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.360]   in the right direction.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.760]   And it's so easy just to reckon, to think of yourself
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.320]   as I'm always missing that and not getting that done.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.880]   And you know all the things that you wanted to get done
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.400]   this week, this month, this year that you didn't.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.780]   And so, it's easy to feel behind.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.120]   But when I've reflected back on the decade though,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.460]   I realized, wow, no, actually,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.340]   I'm making tremendous progress toward my goals
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.420]   and that's been deeply motivating.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.700]   So, what I thought I would do in today's show
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.760]   is just simply share with you some of my reflections,
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.000]   tell you a few stories about the last decade for me.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.540]   I'll share with you some of the lessons that I have learned
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.160]   as I've processed some of the accomplishments
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   of the last decade, some of the failures of the last decade,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.380]   and then talk with you a little bit about what I see
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.200]   in the next decade and some of my big picture goals
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.160]   and some of the personal systems that I'm seeking to have
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.480]   in my life that will hopefully allow me
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.960]   to achieve some of my goals.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   So, beginning with some of the biggest impact events
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.360]   of the last 10 years, the most obvious biggest impact events
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.960]   for me is simply that I got married.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.080]   My wife and I got married within the last decade.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.560]   And then of course, we went on to have,
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.360]   so far we've had four children.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.600]   And being married and having children
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   has basically formed the basic structure of our lives.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   And as I was reflecting on lessons learned,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.040]   I have no regrets about getting married.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.120]   Thankfully, I married my best friend
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.320]   and my wife would say the same thing,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.840]   that she married her best friend.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.520]   And so, we've been really blessed.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   Many times we talk and I realize that when we chat,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.200]   I just realized more and more as we get older
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.160]   how deeply compatible we are.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.000]   And that's a real blessing where I'm more looking forward
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.760]   to the future than I was 10 years ago.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.280]   I'm more excited about our life together
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.760]   than I was 10 years ago.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.120]   And we have a few things that we disagree on,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.860]   but in general, she and I are highly compatible,
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.460]   which just really is a blessing.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.520]   I was reflecting with her and talking about,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.960]   do I have any regrets about getting married?
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.240]   So, I have no regrets about actually getting married.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.280]   If I do have regrets, which I don't love to worry
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   about things that are in the past,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.100]   'cause you can't change it.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.800]   I don't like the whole idea of having regrets.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   But if I were to do it over again,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.120]   would I do things differently?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.880]   I think one of the things I would probably do differently
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.720]   if I were doing it over again,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.420]   is I'd probably get married younger.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.200]   I wish that we had gotten married younger.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.480]   We married at 26, which is not exactly old.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.720]   It's also not exactly young.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.560]   It's the exact median age of many of the people
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.360]   who do marry in today's world.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.960]   It's what all the data would say,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.320]   it's a good age to get married,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.800]   where you're old enough and mature enough, et cetera.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   But I guess for me, when I look back,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.560]   I don't know why we waited so long.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.180]   My wife probably would have been willing to marry earlier.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.000]   I was the one who dragged my feet.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.100]   And I think I wish that we'd married younger.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.200]   Can't change it.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.700]   We both did fine.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.800]   Don't have any regrets about anything.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.360]   It's not like it's a big thing.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.040]   I just wish we'd, I think it would have been nice
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.200]   to have had more memories together as a married couple
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.840]   from those years in the early 20s.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.120]   I've thought a lot about this,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.480]   and I'll finish off that marriage series
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.260]   that I've neglected for quite a while here,
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.800]   but I'll finish that off here in January,
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.820]   about how to find an excellent wife.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.880]   I really think that if you're careful and thoughtful,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.640]   it has to be careful and thoughtful.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   You can't just go in and say, oh, I love this person,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.840]   so I'm gonna marry them.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.280]   But if you're careful and thoughtful,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.120]   getting married young is really, really the way to go.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.240]   At least I'm convinced for me.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.320]   So that would be one thing that I would change.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.760]   Another thing that I would probably change
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.440]   is if I could figure out a way to do it.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.560]   I wish that we'd done something more radical
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.440]   with regard to our first year of marriage.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.280]   Now, a lot of people would say
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.000]   we did some pretty radical stuff.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.320]   We lived, I'll talk about housing.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.600]   We lived in our first year of marriage
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.800]   in this tiny little 234 square foot studio apartment
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.720]   that we rented right by the beach.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.360]   It's about $500 a month, I think, was our rental cost.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.200]   And it was great.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.360]   We really loved it, and I'm really glad we did that.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   One of the things I would probably change
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.200]   if I were doing it over again
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.680]   is I'd probably stay a little longer
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.760]   in that particular place,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.080]   instead of moving out into the big house
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.280]   that we did move into.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.320]   But in hindsight, I've often wondered
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.000]   how cool it would have been to have done something
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.360]   where we took a longer honeymoon.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.340]   We took a two-week honeymoon.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.960]   Seems to be a trend, what I'm noticing,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.920]   among many of my friends,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.560]   that some people aren't even taking honeymoons,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.960]   or they're delaying their honeymoons.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.800]   I've never quite understood that.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.680]   We had a nice honeymoon.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   But I wish we'd done something more radical.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.080]   If I were doing it over again,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.920]   one of the things that I would think about
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.680]   would be doing something like buying
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.000]   an inexpensive pickup truck,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.840]   putting an inexpensive truck camper on that,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.260]   and doing a long drive, maybe down to South America.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.000]   Do the Alaska to Argentina drive, something like that,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.760]   and do it over the course of a year.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.300]   Wouldn't cost all that much money.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.880]   I could probably fit out the rig for 10 grand or under.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.000]   Maybe do it in a van.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.700]   I like the truck camper, but 10 grand on a rig,
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.360]   and probably 30 grand on travel expenses.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.560]   So you're in it for $40,000.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.360]   But to go on the road for $40,000
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.400]   and have a one-year honeymoon,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.520]   I think would be pretty cool.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   I've followed some people who've done that.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.120]   At the time, I didn't have probably the guts to do it.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.520]   No one brought the idea to me.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.040]   No one suggested it.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.720]   And it was a problematic, difficult time for me
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.760]   in my business, where I was very much
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.000]   trying to build a financial advice business.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.160]   And so I have no idea how I could have,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.420]   I don't know how I could have actually done that,
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.180]   because it would have been dumb for me
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.640]   to walk away from building a business
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.920]   because I was just behind.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.720]   So the only way I can see that possibly with my children,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.080]   what I'll try to help them,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.920]   is I wish I'd had more money saved when we married.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.240]   I wish I hadn't spent so much money on college.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.880]   I don't know if I wish I hadn't gone to college.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.760]   That's hard to say, 'cause I'm the kind of person
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.540]   who's a good fit for college.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.920]   But when I think about what I could have done instead,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.800]   if somebody had come along and given me a vision,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.360]   I went to college just because I'm not a loser.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.240]   And in the culture that I was a part of,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.200]   the school culture, only losers didn't go to college,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.040]   and I'm not a loser.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.200]   So obviously, I'm the kind of person
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.040]   who's gonna go to college.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.420]   That was it.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.120]   I never thought about not going to college.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.380]   It was just simply just kind of a default option.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.720]   But what I didn't have was I didn't ever have somebody
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.780]   who came and said, "You can choose not to go to college
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.120]   "and not actually be a loser."
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.180]   So I didn't see clearly
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.120]   what the opportunity cost of college was.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.620]   I didn't know what I was giving up.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.160]   No one had done a financial projection
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.620]   of what my financial life would look like
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.260]   if instead of taking four years off from work
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.500]   and going and spending tens of thousands of dollars
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.560]   on a college degree, I had simply gone and started work.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.920]   No one had talked to me about how I could achieve
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.900]   the same goals with, or the same things with self-education.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.820]   No one had given me specific ideas and plans,
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.600]   and so I went to college.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   And it's fine, it worked out fine,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.400]   but what it meant was that I was behind,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.920]   and I was behind on my money earning too
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.800]   in those years too.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.200]   Nobody told me that I could save 50% of my income.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.760]   So I thought saving 10% of my income was a good thing to do.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.920]   No one told me I could save 50.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.320]   No one told me I could save 90% of my income.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.760]   No one told me that I could save
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.120]   and pay cash for my first house.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.020]   And so if somebody had come along
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.020]   and given me more of those ideas at a young age,
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.260]   I think I would have been inspired
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.860]   and actually accomplished those goals.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.660]   But I didn't have the creativity
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.260]   to pursue those goals in those years.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.900]   And if I had, then I probably could have been
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.160]   in a situation where I could take a year off
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.960]   and take a year-long honeymoon, something like that.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.760]   But there was just no way that I could do that for myself.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.000]   So those were some of my reflections on getting married.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.560]   Glad I did it.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.860]   Probably wish I'd done it sooner.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.600]   Probably wish I'd taken a longer honeymoon.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.820]   Other than that, I'm pretty happy with how it all went.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.460]   One of these days I'll record a show on weddings,
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.320]   but I think my wife and I did a pretty good job.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.100]   We spent a little under 10 grand on our wedding,
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.400]   if my memory is right,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.900]   which was much more than we had to spend.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.900]   We could have done it cheap, but we didn't cheap out on it.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.100]   But it was far less than what we could have spent.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.360]   And I feel like that was a pretty decent thing to do.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.700]   It was important to me in those times
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.220]   to have some of the nice stuff.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.020]   I wasn't as content with frugal decisions
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.620]   and whatnot as I am now.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.360]   On the children, obviously children have shaped
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.100]   the course of our lives.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.620]   We've had four children.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.020]   Our eldest is six, so we've got four children,
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.560]   six and under now.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.300]   And that's been awesome.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.760]   I wouldn't change it a bit.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.860]   Being a father has been for me
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.700]   a completely transformative experience.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.620]   Not in kind of the hokey trite way where I was,
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.460]   hey, held my first baby and my life flashed before my eyes
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.020]   and I saw myself completely differently.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.020]   I've never had any of those flash of epiphany
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.520]   experiences like that.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.060]   But it has changed me as a man.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.220]   And I think that it's helped me to mature significantly
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.300]   being a father.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.420]   And it's a role that I feel born to play.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.260]   And it's helped me when I think about
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.340]   even just the coming decades of my life,
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.060]   it's influenced all of my goals.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.660]   It's influenced the vision that I have of my life.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.900]   And it's really helped me to have a long-term
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.460]   anchoring point in my life.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.660]   And I feel like it's very psychologically healthy
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.620]   to have those long-term anchoring points.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.220]   I have some friends of mine who are the same age,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.620]   people I went to school with, people that I'm close to
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.420]   who've taken a very different path.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.900]   And I'm not married, no children,
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.460]   but I've just pursued the kind of the single
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:33.100]   earn income, build a business,
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.580]   enjoy the fruits of income lifestyle.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.260]   And they're different.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.620]   Some people really want that
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.820]   and don't want family and children.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.460]   Some people feel like they want family and children,
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.300]   but they just feel like they haven't found the right person.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.980]   Those things are totally fine.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.580]   But as I try to look through their eyes
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.820]   about their lives and compare it to my own,
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.420]   one of the constant impressions that I come away with
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.420]   is how hard it is to have a long-term quest
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.660]   if you don't have children.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.140]   Where when I have children,
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.940]   I'm looking forward to my great-grandchildren
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.860]   and thinking about, all right, what am I gonna do?
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.660]   What kind of great-grandfather am I gonna be?
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.780]   And that gives me this anchoring point
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.740]   as I look forward over the coming century.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.980]   It gives me an anchoring point for my vision.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.460]   It gives me an anchoring point for my desires.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.180]   It gives me an anchoring point for my finances.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.540]   I'm thinking about how do I invest to build a family legacy?
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.340]   How do I build a family business that can be passed on?
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.100]   How do we buy assets and then transfer those assets down
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.180]   through three or four or five generations
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.860]   in a way that is going to be,
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.300]   where they're not just not gonna be spent all of a sudden?
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.540]   And how do we do it in a financially efficient way?
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   You know, doing some decent financial planning
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.860]   and estate planning along the way.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.180]   And how do we take advantage of investment trends
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.700]   when you've got a hundred-year investing lifetime?
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.300]   In terms of my own investment horizon,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.020]   everything that I'm thinking about is 60, 80, 100 years.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.540]   Because my ambition is never to draw from my investments,
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.340]   but purely to use those investments
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.940]   to build a family fortune
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.780]   that can be passed on through the generations.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.340]   I don't ever wanna stop having and generating earned income.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.020]   And so the earned income can be something
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.860]   that will provide my lifestyle.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.140]   And so if I don't ever have to stop earning earned income
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.180]   and live off of money,
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.980]   then it completely changes the investing focus.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.060]   And so that's my focus right now as an investor
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.580]   is thinking how do I invest over a 60, 80, 100, 120,
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.300]   150 year horizon to build a family legacy?
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.340]   And then that anchors even just the things I do day to day.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.820]   Because how do I develop children
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.780]   for whom money can be a blessing and not a curse?
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.140]   How do I develop children who are strong of character,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.700]   who have the things that they need to build stable lives?
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.220]   And it just gives me this long-term perspective
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.980]   that some of my friends don't have.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.980]   I've achieved the majority of the hedonistic
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.820]   things that I've ever wanted.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.540]   And I've never had a fancy car,
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.460]   but that's not really ever been important to me.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.380]   Maybe someday in a few years,
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.900]   I'll go and rent an exotic car in Miami,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.740]   something like that,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.580]   and say, see what it's like
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.500]   to drive a Lamborghini on the beach.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.500]   But I don't care for the flash.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.580]   That's not, I would probably be embarrassed
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.060]   and wanna put the top up so no one could see me, frankly,
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.420]   'cause I don't care for that kind of attention.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.260]   For Christmas, I took my family
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.780]   to an all-inclusive resort on the beach,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.780]   and we stayed at a beautiful resort on the beach
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.900]   and had a great time.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.500]   So I've achieved almost all the lifestyle things
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.340]   that you dream about when you're 13 years old.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.580]   And so I imagine, what would it be like
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.260]   if I were 35 years old,
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.620]   and I were in the situation that I had right now,
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.580]   but I didn't have children?
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.820]   What would be my goals?
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.180]   And it's hard to know.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.260]   Obviously, I would have business goals
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260]   and hopefully have some social goals
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.100]   and some other things.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.780]   But children really have helped me
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.980]   and anchored me very deeply.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.700]   Looking forward over the next century,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.300]   and that's been extremely important to me.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.100]   So have no regrets about having children.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.500]   What would I do differently?
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.380]   I don't think I'd do,
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.460]   well, the only thing I would consider doing differently
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.700]   is that being now an expert on birth tourism,
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.660]   I kind of long for the lost opportunities
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.740]   of all the passports I could collect from my children
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.380]   and all the residencies for them all,
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.100]   if all four of our children had been born
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.980]   outside the United States.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.380]   We did birth tourism for our last baby,
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.180]   but at this point in time,
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.860]   but that was just for one child.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.500]   And that now the obsessive part of me has all,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.420]   I've got it all worked out
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.900]   and all the countries all around the world.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.500]   And I can give you a list of all the countries
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.020]   that I would have a baby in
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.060]   if I were gonna have four babies over again.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.660]   I told my wife, if we have four more babies,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.220]   then I've got it all worked out.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.060]   But I honestly don't think that's realistic.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.340]   I don't know.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.580]   There are people who, for their first child,
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.420]   are willing to go and do birth tourism.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.620]   There certainly are.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.460]   I guess Mike and Lauren are the ones
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.580]   who have a YouTube channel
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.780]   where they've talked about how they did birth tourism.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.940]   They went to Costa Rica to have their first baby.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.220]   My hat's off to them.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.740]   I don't know that my wife and I could have done it.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.780]   I don't know if we would have been adventurous enough.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.140]   Having a baby for the first time is so,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.100]   it's such a new thing,
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.100]   and there's so much emotion
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.840]   and so much planning associated with it, et cetera.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.740]   So to add on to that, the internationalization,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.580]   instead of being, okay, we're gonna be home
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.860]   in our house, in our hometown,
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.500]   but now we're gonna go to the other side of the world
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.420]   and have the baby, that's a hard sale to make.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.940]   So I just don't know how we could have done it up until now.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.420]   For our fourth child, it was not easy,
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.540]   but it was very doable.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.540]   But by that time, we didn't have any real concerns
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.940]   or misgivings about the process of birth.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.360]   And so it was more about some of the logistics
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.340]   of the travel, et cetera.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.180]   And it was easy for us
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.020]   because we were moving from living full-time in an RV
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.780]   to just simply moving into suitcases
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.580]   and moving across the world.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.220]   So that's about the only thing I would change with children.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.500]   Over the coming decade, though,
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.220]   basically some of my most important goals
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.500]   involve the education and the nurturing
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.500]   and the training of my children.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.440]   10 years from now, 20, 30,
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.060]   if I'm sitting here talking to you, in 20, 30,
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.300]   I'll have a 16-year-old,
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.980]   which basically means that I'll have my first adult child
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.240]   moving out of the house.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.700]   Yes, that's not the legal age of majority,
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.860]   but I think that the legal age of majority, 18, is dumb.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.960]   The whole United States of America has no idea.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.340]   There's no cultural coherent philosophy
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.580]   on what makes an adult.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.060]   It's just this crazy mix-up
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.980]   of certain things that you can do at 16,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.100]   certain things you can do at 18,
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.620]   certain things you can do at 21, et cetera.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.540]   And I don't place much stock in the age 18 number.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.220]   I think that the most important years
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.940]   from a parent's perspective
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.620]   are basically from five to about 12 or 13.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.240]   You basically have about seven or eight years.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.060]   And it's my opinion that basically
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.020]   by the time a child reaches about 13-ish, 12 or 13,
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.140]   that's the traditional age of adulthood
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.540]   throughout many traditional cultures.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.060]   The obvious example of that,
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.700]   the Jewish Bar Mitzvah, Bat Mitzvah,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.300]   was not always just a religious ceremony
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.340]   with no actual meaning.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.980]   It was a rite of adulthood, a rite of passage.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.020]   You can find some tribes of Indians
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.460]   who would have rites of passage
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.500]   into manhood at 13 years old.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.460]   And then if you think about what happens physiologically
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.540]   by, for the child in their teens,
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.060]   in the US we call it adolescence,
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.260]   but it's a term that's denoting major changes.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.580]   And those changes are where a child
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.780]   is moving into adulthood.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.460]   And obviously there's a transition period,
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:08.460]   but my ambition is to hold for my children a vision
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.080]   to where about that age
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.840]   there's a rite of passage into adulthood,
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.700]   where I wanna treat them in many ways as adults,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.900]   starting from about those early teenage years.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.980]   Now you kinda gotta work around some of the restrictions
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.860]   in the modern society, they can't drive.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.220]   It's a little easier today in a world of smartphone apps
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.500]   and probably by the time they're 13,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.300]   they can just, if they were living in a modern culture,
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.260]   you can just call up the autonomous taxi
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.180]   to come and pick you up.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.780]   So that solves some of the problems.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.380]   You have major problems with figuring out
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.220]   how to work around all the child labor laws
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.120]   that make it very difficult for children to be employed,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.660]   but entrepreneurship solves most of those problems.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.980]   So, and children still need protection
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.820]   in those teenage years.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.340]   But the point is that by the age of 13,
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.980]   I think a father's role changes.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.500]   And the vision that I have is that at this point,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.220]   I am a parent, and which means I'm in control
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.080]   of my children.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.300]   But starting at about the age of 13,
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.540]   and that time from say 13 to 20,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.020]   I wanna be in more of a coaching role,
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.000]   not in a controlling role.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.940]   I don't want to control my children's decisions,
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.500]   I wanna coach them to make good decisions.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   So we'll see how that works out in the coming decade.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.700]   But for me, the next decade is going to be very involved
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.740]   with my children.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.300]   And a major component of that is education.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.740]   I have big educational ambitions for them.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.580]   And I'm not quite sure how all those things
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.140]   will work out in the next decade.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:46.140]   I've got a lot of ideas, but I think that it's easy to,
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.800]   I wanna be very careful to just look at what's working
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.700]   and what's not working day by day.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.340]   And be open to change and not,
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.260]   and I wanna be careful not to impose my big ideas
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.740]   in a kind of a controlling way
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.220]   where we've got to do it this way.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.940]   I wanna be open to the feedback
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.420]   and be very careful to be open to the feedback.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.900]   That said though, I want to hold a vision and hold,
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.900]   I think that if you have a vision to start with,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.340]   then that can be useful.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.060]   There can be a danger if you don't have a vision,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.560]   then you would probably get subpar results.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.780]   So there's a danger of not having a vision.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.900]   Then on the other hand,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.420]   there's a danger of having such a vision
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.660]   that you don't look to see,
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.340]   are we actually getting good results?
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.180]   And so I wanna find that healthy balance,
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.100]   but I do wanna give, I have a vision for myself
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.740]   and I do have a vision for my children.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.220]   I want my children to be academically excellent
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.020]   and to have an educational process of academic excellence,
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.420]   but I don't want those academics to dominate their life.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.740]   I want it to be a small
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.580]   and very important part of their life,
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.960]   but I want many more practical skills
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.900]   to be every bit as important.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.860]   So what I see in the future is,
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.620]   I want my children to do about three hours of academics,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.860]   three to four hours of academics every day,
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.740]   right in the morning,
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.180]   and then I want their afternoons to be taken up
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.980]   with things like entrepreneurship
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.020]   or working, building practical skills.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.040]   And it's such an exciting time to be a young entrepreneur
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.220]   because there's so many opportunities available
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.080]   that previously were more difficult.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.620]   So many entrepreneurial activities in the past
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.320]   required either a really big local market
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.440]   or required huge amounts of capital.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.000]   But today there are opportunities available
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.240]   for young entrepreneurs
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.640]   that don't require significant financial capital upfront
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.680]   and yet are really big opportunities.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.180]   And so I wanna help my children to work a lot
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.820]   during their young years, to develop businesses.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.200]   I want them to build the skill
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.760]   and the practice of doing some things well,
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.960]   of failing at lots of things
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   so they get used to having success and failure.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.620]   And I wanna do that where it's a very safe environment.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.040]   I don't quite know what the educational environment
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.480]   is gonna look like a decade from now,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   but my ambition is that by the time my children graduate,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.680]   for say about that age of 17, 18, 19, 20,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   that instead of just having a high school diploma,
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.440]   if the educational system looks something like it is today,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.760]   my ambition is that they have a college degree
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.440]   or something close to that.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.200]   I see no reason for academically competent children
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.920]   and young people to not just simply swap out
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.420]   a college degree program instead of high school.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.480]   High school has become so stupid
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.160]   and college has become so stupid
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.440]   that if your children are academically competent,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.480]   they don't see any reason why they shouldn't just do
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   the college level work during those teenage years
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.200]   and skip high school.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.780]   So we're still a long way away from that,
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.560]   but we'll see how that works out over the coming decade.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.800]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.640]   And it'll be interesting to see
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.880]   if I change my mind on that.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.900]   I changed my mind on early child education,
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.040]   so maybe I'll need to change my mind on the college
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   and trying to pursue the college level stuff.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.720]   I just look and see where if you can launch a child,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.480]   and with homeschooling, you certainly can do this.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.760]   If you can just simply launch a child
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.480]   at 18 or 19 years old,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.960]   and if they wanna go to college,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.080]   they just go right into a master's degree program
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.520]   instead of into an undergraduate degree program.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.000]   I see it's hard to see the arguments
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.840]   against why you wouldn't do that.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.160]   And with the ability to get an accredited degree
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.200]   through distance study, with CLEP exams, et cetera,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.520]   it just seems very doable.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.920]   It's what I could have done it
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.640]   if somebody had given me that vision back in those days.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.080]   I think the biggest danger of that
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   is probably the challenge of socialization
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.400]   is an 18 year old ready to go into an environment
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.600]   of master's degree students
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.800]   if they're gonna go pursue a master's degree?
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.120]   Is there some damage that comes to a child
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.040]   because they're not around people
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.680]   who are going through exactly the same program
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.160]   they're going through?
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.720]   I don't think so.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.400]   I think that you can handle the socialization challenges
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.240]   without socialization having to come
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.780]   in the context of academics.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.720]   Many people just have this one idea that,
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.920]   well, the way you socialize your child is in class.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.840]   I thought the point of going to class was to learn.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.880]   So I don't see why socialization
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.000]   would have to be the primary goal of schooling.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.640]   The primary goal of schooling should be education
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.160]   and skill acquisition,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.080]   and then socialization can happen in many different forms.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.160]   I don't know whether I'll still believe that
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.600]   a decade from now, but at the moment,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.100]   that's what I currently think.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.400]   I would like to definitely make sure
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.960]   that I expose my children to lots of travel.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.240]   I wanna make sure I raise them to be multilingual,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.080]   if possible.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.760]   We're finding that very challenging right now,
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.200]   but we're making progress.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.420]   I think it's just challenging at the beginning.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.520]   So I wanna raise my children to be multilingual,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.660]   and that should be helpful to them in time.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.600]   I don't know exactly what all the travel should look like.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   I definitely want to, at some point,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.320]   take a year off and do another year,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.600]   or at least going around the United States and Canada.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   It's just such a beautiful place to travel,
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.040]   so much rich history,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   and I want my children to feel culturally connected to that.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.920]   So I don't know exactly the year
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.120]   that will be the best to do it,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.280]   but I do know that we spent six months
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.800]   full-timing around the US last year,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.580]   and doing it with a, let's see,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.800]   we were traveling with a one-year-old,
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.040]   a three-year-old, and a five-year-old.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.880]   That wasn't the time.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.900]   It's not that we didn't enjoy it.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.740]   We enjoyed it a lot,
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.800]   but all the educational stuff was just, woo!
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.480]   They didn't pay attention.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.240]   They didn't read the signs, et cetera.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.560]   So I have an idea that basically
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.880]   seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.600]   these are the right years to do something like that.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.820]   I think we'll do quite a bit
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.920]   of international travel as well,
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.480]   but I want that international travel
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.160]   to be a mixture of some fun,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.240]   some luxury travel, some vacation stuff,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   but I really want there to be a much deeper work
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.080]   associated with that international travel.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.480]   I'm still working out how that can look like,
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.800]   and what can be the anchoring opportunities.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.600]   I am starting to enjoy doing business travel
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.640]   with my children.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.800]   I tested that out this last year.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.960]   Took my six-year-old son to FinCon,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.920]   and really enjoyed that.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.480]   He was right on the edge,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.520]   where he did a pretty good job.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.980]   It was a little bit of a hindrance to me,
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.180]   and he gained some of the stuff from that trip,
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.080]   but I definitely wanna do much more of that.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.160]   I want my children to be a part
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.080]   of all my personal business travel,
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.120]   so that they can be exposed to that world as well,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.840]   and then figure out how to support them
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.400]   in their ambitions.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.200]   As they work to develop their skills,
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.000]   I wanna figure out how to invest into that.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.120]   It's my basic operating philosophy
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.920]   that investing for college expenses is dumb,
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.920]   and that investing into your child is smart.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:01.160]   I think that the idea that the single best investment
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.400]   to your child is to open a college account is a giant scam,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.760]   and it's far better to invest that money
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.600]   into your child at a young age,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.660]   and then if they wanna go to college,
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.040]   let them figure out how to pay for it
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.720]   than to do it down the road.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.280]   So I'm thinking constantly and looking for opportunities
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.360]   of how do I invest into my children,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.600]   and hire tutors, hire lessons, give them experiences,
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.960]   give them exposure, help them buy tools that they need
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.240]   for the things that they're interested in.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.080]   Those tools can cross the board,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.880]   but that's, to me, much more important,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.000]   and I'm convinced it's much more effective
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   and a better investment than just saving for college.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.200]   Who knows what it'll be 10 years from now.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.520]   So those are kind of some of my reports
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.740]   in the last 10 years, and looking forward
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.320]   over the next 10 years with children.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.520]   Don't know if we'll have more children.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.480]   I'd probably like to.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.780]   My wife and I, we talk about it.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.340]   Just a busy time in our family.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.560]   So we'll see.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.480]   God knows.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.120]   I'll just take it a day at a time with regard to that.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.360]   But it'll be an interesting decade.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.480]   I certainly feel, when I sit at my dinner table
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   and I see my wife and my four children,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.440]   I feel accomplished and successful,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.600]   and I feel pity for people who don't have that,
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.760]   for men who don't have that.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.980]   I feel pity for them because it just seems to me
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.980]   that that is such a profoundly impactful part of my life.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.280]   I wouldn't give it up for anything,
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   and it seems just deeply healthy.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.080]   It seems to be the, it feels, it seems right.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.440]   Now, I have theological arguments and whatnot
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.400]   that could be brought to it,
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.800]   but just from an emotional perspective, I'm proud of.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.000]   Proud of my children's probably the thing I'm most proud of.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.080]   And I want more people to experience that.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.520]   I want more men to experience that satisfaction.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.200]   I could work very happily at some dead-end job
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.120]   that I don't like if I come home
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.080]   and feel like I'm doing it with purpose to support my family.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.700]   It would bring me a great deal of satisfaction.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.200]   Last two decades, or sorry, last decade, let's see, dogs.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.040]   My wife and I were talking about,
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.500]   we have two dogs that we got.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.280]   Dogs are kind of in a mixed bag,
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.960]   where unfortunately, I've grown to really love my dogs.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.280]   And I say unfortunately 'cause I never anticipated
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.440]   that I would love my dogs as much as I do.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.860]   I was never really a dog person.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.580]   Now I always looked at dogs as fairly,
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.240]   I don't know, they're there or they're not.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.880]   My wife really loves dogs, though.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.040]   So we got dogs before we had children.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.160]   And at the time, it seemed like a really good decision.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.240]   We were living a fairly stable life.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.280]   We lived in a house that we owned.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.680]   And we had a big yard,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.560]   and it just seemed like the right thing to do.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.040]   So we didn't plan to get two dogs.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.680]   We planned to get one dog.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.480]   But then while we were looking for a dog,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.980]   we were going around visiting shelters
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.440]   and looking for a dog,
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.240]   we stumbled across a neighbor who had some puppies.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.760]   And we're just there and looking at these little puppies.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.000]   And my wife fell in love with one.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.400]   And I liked another one.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.480]   And well, one thing leads to another.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   And a couple days later, we went home with two puppies.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.260]   So it wasn't a whole lot of thoughtful planning
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.840]   and analysis.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.440]   And then they just become a part of your life,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.400]   and you grow to really love them, et cetera.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.440]   If I were to do it over again, though,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.220]   I don't think I would do it exactly that way.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.040]   Having two dogs is in some ways a real blessing.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.840]   It's nice for the dogs that they always have a friend.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.040]   You know, they always have somebody to play with.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.800]   The biggest problem with the dogs
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.360]   is that when there are two of them,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.600]   it really does change the dynamic of other aspects of life.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.940]   For example, the dogs are a real hindrance
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.560]   to my geographic flexibility.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.000]   And the fact that there are two of them
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.740]   makes it very difficult to find people
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.440]   who are willing to dog sit.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.320]   It's far easier to have multiple children
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.520]   than to have multiple dogs.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.960]   If you have one dog, you can ask almost anybody,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.240]   "Hey, would you be willing to take care of my dog?"
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.520]   But when you have two dogs,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.640]   you're basically limited to people who are dog people
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.960]   being willing to do that, or who have a really good yard,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.520]   because the two dogs just, they take up more space,
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.920]   they're more boisterous, require more control, et cetera.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.400]   And so that really limits the number of people
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.760]   who are willing to take care of our dogs.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.540]   And so that's been challenging.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.340]   The other just practical challenge
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.400]   is that I've reached a point at which,
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.420]   as much as I love renting houses,
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.080]   the rental market is not kind
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.160]   to people with four children and two dogs.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   Four children is, you face a little bit of discrimination.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.800]   Again, let's see, let's make up a word
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.640]   that makes us sound pitiable.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.400]   Large family discrimination.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.160]   The world is not really set up for four children.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.080]   If we have more, you're totally not set up for it.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.520]   So that makes potential landlords, mainstream landlords,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   raise their eyes a little bit.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.760]   But when you bring in dogs,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.120]   because of the potential destructiveness of dogs,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.400]   and you have two of them, it just changes things.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.160]   And so it makes it much more challenging,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.600]   much more expensive for a family of my size
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.760]   to be able to go and do something
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.120]   as simple as renting a house.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.700]   That's one of the expenses
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.520]   that I didn't think much about with a dog.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.180]   And again, if you'd asked me,
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.320]   I guess I probably could have come up
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.100]   with reasons against it.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.760]   But what I thought was that,
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.080]   I thought, well, I own my own house.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.240]   And when you own your own house, then what does it matter?
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.060]   Well, it's still, those things do add up over time.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.560]   The other thing about the dogs is just simply,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.080]   I underestimated how expensive their medical costs can be.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.640]   I've got one dog that was totally healthy,
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.240]   and she hasn't cost me a bit,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.920]   but her brother has had just this,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.200]   all kinds of chronic skin conditions and allergies.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.940]   And I'm a pretty practical guy, love my dogs.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.160]   But if you came to me and said,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.240]   "Hey, this dog's got cancer, and we could do surgery,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.080]   "but it's gonna be $5,000."
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.040]   I'd say, "Hmm, love the dog.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.480]   "He's gonna have to either make it on his own,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.840]   "but I'm not gonna spend $5,000 on it."
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.440]   Well, the problem is that I've had
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.320]   these chronic health issues with this one dog,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.480]   and trying to figure out how to get him healthy.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.520]   It doesn't come out 5,000 bucks at a time.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.120]   It's come out 500 bucks at a time,
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.960]   and 700 here, and then 300 there, and 600 there, et cetera.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.560]   And it just really bugs me
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.760]   of how much money I've spent on this dog.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.400]   And yet it's just this deep,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.600]   kind of these deep emotions where I really love the guy,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.080]   you know, especially I've spent so much money on him,
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.920]   I really love the guy.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.320]   And he's wormed his way into my heart,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   just like dogs have a tendency to do.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.800]   So my relationship with my dogs is somewhat conflicted.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.440]   But in hindsight, I probably wouldn't get two of them.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.920]   And when these guys die, I don't know if I'll replace them.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.240]   But I probably, if I do replace them,
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.480]   I'd probably replace them with one.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.320]   It's just excessive.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.560]   Now, if I had, and the biggest change
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   is simply the change of conditions,
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.760]   that there was no problem when I had a big house,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.200]   big yard, et cetera.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.840]   But then as soon as I tried to move into other conditions,
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.880]   and I sold my house,
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.320]   moved into a house without a yard, et cetera,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.240]   as soon as I started to do that,
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.440]   then all of a sudden those two dogs became more difficult.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.960]   And I'm not the kind of person who walks away from dogs.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.800]   I mean, I just never,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.080]   I guess some people give up their dogs
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.120]   or put them up for adoption.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.560]   I would never even, I've never even considered that.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.160]   It just seems like a dereliction of responsibility.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.400]   But those are my thoughts on dogs.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.880]   What about houses?
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.080]   Well, we've had quite the interesting housing journey
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.360]   over the last decade.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.000]   I lived at home with my family until I married,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   which I definitely really am a fan of, strongly recommend.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.560]   It really bothers me,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:36.360]   the kind of the anti-living with family thing that exists,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.760]   at least in the United States,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.880]   where the idea is as soon as you're 18,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.760]   then you're supposed to not live with family.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.120]   It's lonely, it stinks.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.960]   There's a good chance you make some bad decisions
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.600]   in those circumstances.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.080]   I don't like the idea of adult children
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.120]   being a leech on their family members.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.520]   I think that's a really bad.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.120]   So if an adult child is irresponsible
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.480]   and you're just milking mom and dad,
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.840]   and I don't think that's healthy at all.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.080]   I think they gotta be kicked out in that situation.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.600]   But I do, I think that the ideal circumstance to be in
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.500]   is to live with family,
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.040]   to be though a productive
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.120]   and contributing member of the household,
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.240]   and then to, until you form your own family,
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.520]   get married and move out.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.040]   I think that's a really great way to do it
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.060]   because you get so many social benefits.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.880]   You can maintain these close relationships
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.480]   with family members.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.320]   You're not lonely.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.080]   You don't have to stare at some empty apartment
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.360]   all the time.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.200]   There's a useful restraint
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.920]   by having still that family influence on,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.800]   it's less likely to engage in immoral behavior, et cetera.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.860]   If you have your families nearby,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.600]   I think it could be a real blessing to parents.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.080]   I thought seriously about moving out,
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.920]   but I was paying rent.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.840]   So like, why wouldn't I want my rent to go to my dad?
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.880]   Why wouldn't I want him to have the rent money
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.560]   instead of it going to somebody else?
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.680]   So I lived with family until I got married.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.600]   And then for the first year that my wife and I were married,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.680]   we lived in this little tiny apartment.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.160]   Going back, what I'd do differently,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.060]   I would probably stay in that apartment longer.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.160]   We lived there for a year,
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.860]   and then we bought a big house and moved into there.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.120]   And it seemed like a good decision, and it was.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.860]   It seemed like a good decision at the time
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.860]   because of, well, we could afford it.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.260]   I was very careful, I'm very careful in buying the house.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.900]   And the house worked out great.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.860]   We lived there for a few years,
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.720]   made a lot of money when we sold the house,
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.660]   and it was a good deal.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.380]   But I think if I were to reflect with some
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.460]   detachment of time,
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:41.420]   I think I was still trying to prove that I'm not a loser.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.580]   I was still going down the checklist of,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.620]   go to high school, graduate high school,
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.000]   go to college, get a college degree, get a job,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.780]   buy a house, get married, get a dog, have children.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.360]   I was still going through the checklist.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   Now, it wasn't a clearly articulated thing,
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.800]   but in hindsight, I can see that I felt this pressure
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.960]   not to be a loser, to buy a house because I'm not a loser.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.120]   Losers sit around and rent forever, and I'm not a loser,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.200]   so I'm gonna buy a house.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.000]   And the house was nice.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.700]   It gave us some nice opportunities.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.640]   But it also resulted in such an immediate increase
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.440]   of stuff to maintain a house,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.840]   and it became the time sink that, of course, it is,
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.880]   that it just, it definitely cut down
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.240]   on my freedom and flexibility.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.760]   And when I sold the house
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.040]   and started renting an apartment again,
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.240]   I was very pleased with that.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.640]   And currently I rent, and I'm very pleased with that.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.200]   So I'm glad that I bought the house
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.160]   because I could experience all of those emotions
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.360]   and all of those financial costs, et cetera.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.460]   I'm glad that I had that experience.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.120]   But looking back, if I were optimizing things,
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.000]   I would have stayed living
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.640]   in the $500 a month apartment longer,
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.280]   and I would not have bought a house to live in.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.500]   I would have bought a house to rent.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.460]   The biggest financial mistake that I made
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.560]   over the last 10 years was probably not buying
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.120]   a long string of rental properties every year.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.160]   And it's become my go-to thing,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.760]   where I've realized that if I had just done
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.380]   one thing differently over the last 10 years,
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.640]   just simply for the first five years of marriage,
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.200]   my wife and I had done something as simple as buy a house,
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.920]   just conventional house, conventional financing, et cetera,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.760]   buy a house, move into it, live in it for a year
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   to satisfy the requirements of an owner-occupied mortgage,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.420]   and then go ahead and put a tenant in it and move out.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.380]   If we had just done that
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.280]   over the first five years of our life,
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.760]   that would have been one of the best things
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.500]   that we could have done.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.720]   And it's not that, we're not broke, we're not hurting,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.200]   but that's something that I wish I had done.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.920]   Once again, someone hadn't sold me on the idea,
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.120]   and I wish you'd done that strategy.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.960]   That's a strategy that I think would have worked for us,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.360]   and we could have done house hacking,
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.240]   put somebody in the house with us too,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.040]   but that's a strategy that I wish I had done back then.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.320]   So if you are getting married and you're 26 years old,
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.440]   I beg of you, don't buy a house to live in
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.440]   in the first year, don't buy a house to rent,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   and just move for, do one a year.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.280]   It doesn't have to be a lot,
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.760]   it doesn't have to be a full-time thing.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.080]   Just buy one house per year
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.600]   until you own five or 10 of 'em,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.120]   and then let your tenants pay off the mortgages for you.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.200]   It's the most profoundly simple
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.840]   and effective financial plan
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.640]   that I can possibly come up with.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.000]   It's a plan that works the best in the United States
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.720]   because of the financing market, which is very unique,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.240]   and so it works really well in a US context,
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.840]   but if I could get young couples to do that,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.200]   it would just be a big, it'd be well worth doing.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.040]   One of the reflections that I've had
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.720]   of things that have changed for me over the last 10 years
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.800]   is I've come to appreciate more than anything
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.080]   how at certain times of your life,
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.240]   certain things are important,
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.280]   and they're just not important at other times in your life.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:20.640]   And the key is to get real clarity on those time changes.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.240]   And so, for example, one of the things
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.320]   that when my wife and I bought our first house,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.240]   we didn't go extravagant with that,
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.520]   but again, I do think there was a bit of that,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.160]   well, I'm gonna prove that I'm not a loser.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.880]   I'm gonna prove to my wife that I'm not a loser.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.160]   I can buy her a fancy house.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.520]   I'm gonna prove to my friends that I'm not a loser
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.960]   and show them that I can buy a fancy house, et cetera,
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.440]   but I was rushing something that we didn't need.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.240]   I didn't need a big house.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.600]   We didn't have any children.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.280]   Even if you got one baby, stick the baby in the closet.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.080]   They just don't take up that much space.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:54.920]   They're babies.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.680]   They have a lot of stuff, but you can avoid that
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.440]   and grab a dresser drawer from the side of the road
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.960]   and put a pad in it and stick 'em in the closet.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.120]   It's not that big a deal.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.120]   And it's so easy in that phase to just stay living that way
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.880]   and it makes such a profound difference down the road.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.220]   Now, you move on to the phase that we're at right now
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.100]   with a six-year-old, and now all of a sudden,
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.240]   you need some more space.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.840]   You legitimately need more space.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.280]   You don't legitimately need more space to have a baby,
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.960]   but you do legitimately need more space
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.640]   with a six-year-old and with a 10-year-old, et cetera.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.480]   And so,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:32.000]   I wish that I had done a better job.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.760]   I didn't do a bad job, but I could have done a better job
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.640]   of delaying that gratification a little bit longer,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.820]   not trying to live my life based upon this societal script,
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.760]   but really focusing on investing in the early years.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.320]   I could have done more on that.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.880]   I wish I had.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.680]   Now, what ultimately saved my finances
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.640]   was that I've had profitable businesses as well.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.280]   And so, do you have to make money on everything?
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.800]   No, and at the time,
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.600]   if I were coaching the Joshua of those years,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.920]   I would have said, "Well, Joshua,
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.880]   you've got plenty of economic opportunity
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.500]   in this high-income job or high-income business,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.120]   so you don't have to do all these things."
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.240]   But looking back, I just,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.480]   if you have the ability and it's not that hard, why not?
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.500]   Why not maximize those investments?
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.840]   Why not go ahead and buy five houses
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.200]   during the first five years of marriage?
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.100]   I think it would have been a better move,
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.480]   and I wish I'd done that.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.220]   So going forward, I'm doing it going forward.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.340]   When we're talking 10 years from now,
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.800]   I won't be saying, "I wish I'd bought five or 10 houses.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.780]   I will own five or 10 houses,"
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:44.480]   because it's just a profoundly simple and effective plan.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.200]   I'm still working through
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.120]   whether I'm gonna buy more real estate in the United States
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.880]   or outside the United States, et cetera,
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.560]   but just 'cause something was a good idea back then
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.840]   doesn't mean it's not a good idea now.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.640]   Other interesting things,
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   we full-time RV'd during the last decade,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.320]   which was pretty cool.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.900]   I don't often give myself a lot of permission to brag,
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.600]   but I gotta say, it was pretty cool.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.000]   We did some stuff that was pretty cool
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.600]   and that most people simply don't do.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.720]   We got rid of all of our stuff.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.640]   We bought an RV and we moved into an RV,
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.920]   and we had three little children,
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.400]   and we traveled all around the United States.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.800]   The only reason, I thought we were gonna do it for a year.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.680]   We wound up doing it for six months,
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.560]   which was a little bit short,
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.840]   but the only reason we cut the trip short
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.700]   was that we did something cooler.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.680]   We had a baby and moved outside the United States
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:36.060]   and wasn't gonna RV overseas.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.360]   So we didn't fail at RVing, and I loved doing that.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.400]   It just has a special place in my heart.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.560]   It was, in many ways, a fulfillment of a childhood dream.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.400]   I always wanted RVs.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.680]   I've owned a couple of them over the last decade,
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.320]   and we really enjoyed it.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.760]   I really enjoyed traveling around the United States
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.600]   that way.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.440]   It's the best way to see the United States.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.740]   Such an awesome place, such an awesome country,
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.620]   and the RVing infrastructure is so strong.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.000]   It's just a really cool way to travel.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.160]   And maybe someday I will.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.960]   I could happily move back into an RV and do it again.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.080]   The thing that wasn't awesome about it
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.360]   was just simply that our children were very young.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.800]   We were traveling with a one-year-old
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.200]   and a three-year-old and a five-year-old,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.320]   and that's a lot of work.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.720]   It's a lot of work when,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.740]   especially the one-year-old and three-year-old,
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.080]   in an RV there's not a lot of physical space.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.920]   And so if the children are older,
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.080]   you just say, "Get out of here and come back at dinnertime,"
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.120]   and they disappear for four hours.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.920]   But when the children are younger, you can't do that.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   You say, "Get out of here and go play,"
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.360]   and three and a half minutes later,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.960]   "Mommy, will you help me move this?"
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.720]   And so we had a big enough RV that it wasn't terrible,
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.880]   but my wife wasn't sad to move into a house again.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.440]   I, on the other hand, did miss it.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.900]   I don't know why.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.760]   It seems so dumb to even admit,
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.200]   but it was just such a cozy way to live
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.720]   that I genuinely liked.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.560]   In the beginning of our trip,
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.600]   we mostly stayed in campgrounds,
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.300]   but towards the end we were doing more just traveling,
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.920]   and we wound up staying in Walmart parking lots.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.320]   And I genuinely like pooling into a Walmart parking lot
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.040]   and going into my house and setting up.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.800]   And it's something really special to me,
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.760]   really cozy, and I really enjoyed it.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.840]   I think we'll do it again when the children are older.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.360]   I definitely think we'll do it again.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.480]   I'm not committing to a specific timeline
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.360]   because I did really enjoy it,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.560]   and I wanna do it more,
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.680]   especially when they can really engage
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.960]   with a lot more of the activities
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.840]   and a lot more of the educational opportunities
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.680]   of that kind of travel.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.320]   I don't think I'll do it again soon though.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.480]   And the biggest cost of that RV trip
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.840]   was just simply in my own productivity.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.480]   I thought that I was gonna be able
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.540]   to be very productive from the road.
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.100]   My whole podcasting setup, my laptop,
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.480]   and everything just fits in a backpack.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.440]   And so I thought that I was gonna be able
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.680]   to be very productive and do my business
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.920]   and that it wouldn't be a major problem.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.080]   I underestimated the cost though
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.160]   of how much help my wife needed
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.200]   and how much it took to care for her
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.920]   and to make sure that she had what she needed
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.240]   and to care for the children.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.520]   And so that just simply cut into my work time.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.340]   And because it cut into my work time,
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.840]   it was a major cost to me and my business
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.920]   of the stuff that I didn't get done
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.560]   that I should have gotten done.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.200]   And so it was in many ways,
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.340]   that year was in many ways a lost year financially.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.060]   It was a lost year in my business.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:32.100]   And that, it was an expensive trip from that perspective.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.700]   It didn't cost us a ton of money
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.480]   with the simple cost of living.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.600]   We spent about the same amount of money traveling
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.880]   as we did sitting still.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.520]   But it was expensive in what I couldn't get done
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.360]   in my business.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.760]   And so that was the problem.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:55.620]   So I've learned that I need to be more stable
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.120]   in order for me to get more work done,
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.640]   which is important for me at this point in time.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.520]   So it's not gonna happen,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.860]   I'm not gonna go back to RVing in the next couple of years
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.060]   until I can get my business more systematized,
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.440]   get more help, so that even if I did RV,
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.240]   that my business continues to grow.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.620]   'Cause I don't like it when things shrink.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.960]   I don't like losing money, I don't like it
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.460]   when things shrink.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.640]   Glad I did the RV adventures.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.940]   One of the biggest things that I've learned
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.000]   is I've bought and sold a bunch of stuff
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.060]   over the last decade.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.260]   And that's not something I did when I was a kid.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.500]   I wasn't a wheeler and a dealer.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.040]   My dad wasn't a wheeler and a dealer.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.300]   I didn't grow up in a wheeling and dealing household.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.220]   And so I've had to intentionally embrace
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.700]   buying and selling stuff.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.900]   And in the first kind of transactions,
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.980]   it was scary to me to buy stuff
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.420]   because I didn't wanna make financial mistakes.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.860]   But now I've come to the point
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.300]   where I trust myself a lot more.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.220]   And like even my RV adventures.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.520]   I've basically broke even on all of my RV adventures.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.860]   And there's a bunch of vehicles thrown in,
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.260]   a bunch of trailer, a motor home.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.660]   And I've come to trust myself
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:03.300]   and my ability to buy and sell intelligently.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.020]   My ability to buy a deal
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   and to just be willing to say, that's a good deal.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.060]   I know it's a good deal and here's the cash
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.140]   and I'll just buy it.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.700]   And then my ability to sell on the other side
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.740]   and make a profit.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.500]   I've made a profit on some transactions.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.540]   I've only lost money on a handful of transactions.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.540]   But overall, that's really helped my personal confidence.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.220]   And the neat thing about it from a financial perspective
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.260]   is it opens up opportunities.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.060]   The retail market for toys stinks.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.060]   You know, the idea that, listen,
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.900]   we got a dual income household and we want to,
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.900]   so that's a brutally dumb financial perspective as well.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.500]   So, but we got two jobs in the household,
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.460]   but we want an RV.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.300]   So let's just go and we'll go buy a new RV
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.420]   and put it on payments and we'll buy it
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:50.540]   and we'll use it for a few years.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.920]   And you turn around and sell it three years later
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.620]   for 50% less.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.420]   And that's just a terribly expensive decision
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.980]   because you lose so much money on the depreciation
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.700]   and you can't be losing that much money
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.060]   and actually be on a,
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.180]   gonna have a breakout trajectory on wealth building
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.540]   for financial planning, for financial freedom I mean.
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.260]   But if you change that out,
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.620]   and let's say that you have a capital account.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.140]   Let's say you got 50 grand or 100 grand.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.460]   Let's make it 100 grand.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.460]   You got 100 grand and this is the 100 grand
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.900]   that we spend on stuff.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.420]   We're gonna have $100,000 worth of stuff
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.700]   whether those are cars, boats, RVs, motorcycles,
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.540]   airplanes, et cetera.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.260]   Then, and you just say this is the amount.
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.580]   You can do things in a totally different way.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.420]   Or you say, hey, let's own an RV for a few years.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.940]   And so you wait for, you do your research on what you want.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.340]   You wait for a good deal.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.620]   You buy the thing at a deep discount.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.820]   You use it for a few years and then you flip it.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.680]   And whether you go and buy it at a repo auction
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.940]   and flip it, flip a new one,
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.340]   whether you buy one from where you take over the payments
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.820]   from somebody who's in distress and you bail them out.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.620]   Who knows, like everything is different.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.340]   Or you buy something old that's just gonna
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.180]   maintain its value.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.620]   You buy an antique that's gonna go up in value.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.620]   Whatever the deal is, when you can buy cheap,
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.020]   hold, and then sell at a profit or only a small loss,
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.100]   it totally changes the ability to access toys
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.340]   and to have a bunch of fun stuff
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.820]   without it hurting your finances.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.340]   So for me, that's been a big change
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.580]   that I've learned over the last decade.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.860]   Where I'm willing to have just about any toy,
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.180]   but I'm not trying to say I'm gonna have
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.700]   this certain thing forever.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.060]   And I'll just buy the thing.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.540]   I'll make sure that I'm super careful
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.460]   about getting an awesome deal on it.
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.020]   And we'll enjoy the toy for a time and then we'll flip it.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.060]   And the goal is always make some money.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.060]   But not to be a lot of money,
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.100]   but make some money on the flip.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.860]   And that allows me to have all the fun stuff
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.340]   without feeling like I'm harming my wealth building.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.580]   And so I wanna help, one of my parenting goals,
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:49.820]   I wanna help my children to wheel and deal a little bit
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.860]   and help them to have the confidence
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.420]   of doing some flipping themselves.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.820]   So that they can have the fun toys that they want
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.380]   for themselves and their families.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.260]   And be confident about it without them feeling
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.660]   like they have to go out and pay retail.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.540]   We've built some pretty cool photo albums
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.380]   over the last decade.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:10.540]   We've traveled a bunch of places.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.420]   We did the math.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:15.620]   I've been in the last decade, I think,
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.940]   to a dozen international countries.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:22.100]   So that's a pretty cool accomplishment.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.300]   It's such a blessing to be able to do that.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.300]   And I have never, never set travel goals.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:29.420]   I don't have any formal travel goals about the number of,
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.420]   I wanna go to this country, et cetera.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.100]   I have a list of destinations I'd like to go to
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.820]   and I look for opportunities.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.700]   And I'm always attracted to the idea of,
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.260]   I'm gonna travel to every country in the world.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.540]   And then I try to rope myself in and say,
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.940]   Josh, you don't really care about that.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.940]   But we've just done some awesome stuff.
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:49.540]   We've been so blessed to do big fishing trips
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:52.300]   and camping trips and just some really cool stuff.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.180]   I went to see the solar eclipse.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.100]   That was one of the things that I wish I'd taken my family,
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.100]   just didn't work out.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.380]   But I went and I was right in the black zone,
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.300]   I think Georgia, I guess it was in Georgia,
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.220]   for the solar eclipse, which was really cool.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.900]   And the next one, I'll definitely make a real event
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.780]   out of taking my children and making sure
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.980]   that we're right in the middle of that zone
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.980]   for the solar eclipse that's coming up in a few years.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.140]   And there's more I could say on some of that stuff.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.860]   In business, pivot to business now,
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.340]   it's been a great decade.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.620]   In the beginning of the decade, I was a financial advisor
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.900]   and I was building a financial advice business,
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.740]   which was a really rewarding experience.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.180]   Then I left that to start Radical Personal Finance,
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.980]   which has been a transformative event in my life.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:45.180]   Probably, obviously probably one of the biggest things
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.020]   that has allowed me and provided me with the opportunity
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:51.500]   to live just a really awesome lifestyle.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.940]   It's allowed me to level up my freedom,
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.860]   my personal freedom, really substantially.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:01.980]   And it's been a very difficult road.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.340]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.540]   I often believe that people can do things.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.980]   And so I wanna be an encouraging person.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.820]   Then sometimes I reflect on how impossible some things are
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.180]   and I get scared and I was like, nobody should ever do this.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.660]   Like it was, starting Radical Personal Finance
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.820]   was just flat out stupid.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.740]   I have no idea how it worked, but it did.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:25.740]   It was a lot of work, a lot of work, but it's worked.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:29.820]   And I've achieved many of the things
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.000]   that I thought I could achieve.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.700]   It's been probably the most rewarding thing for me
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.700]   is that I feel like there's a near perfect alignment
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:47.180]   between my skills and my interests and my daily work.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.540]   Today's a little bit rough.
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:54.020]   I've got this weird cough and congested sinuses
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.820]   that my family has had it for the last couple of weeks
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.020]   and just trying to kick it.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.100]   But it's, so I'm a little off my game today.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.380]   But in general, when I turn on a microphone,
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.340]   I feel like I'm doing something that I'm very good at.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.060]   And that's really rewarding to do something
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:10.700]   that you're very good at.
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:15.700]   And I have the opportunity to use a huge amount of knowledge
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.580]   that I've built and use it to help people.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.140]   I was reflecting on my educational accomplishments
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.340]   in the last decade.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.720]   In the last decade, I got a master's degree
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.180]   in financial planning.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:31.700]   I got my CFP designation, Certified Financial Planner,
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.580]   became a Chartered Life Underwriter for life insurance,
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.100]   Chartered Financial Consultant with the American College.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:41.900]   I became a Chartered Advisor in philanthropy,
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.300]   which was a really cool set of courses that I did
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.940]   with a bunch of other professionals.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.940]   I became a, let's see, a Registered Health Underwriter,
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.500]   a health insurance specialist,
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.340]   Registered Employee Benefit Consultant.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.860]   I got a certification in long-term care planning.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:02.420]   I think there was one more, I can't remember.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.860]   And I had to go find all the diplomas in my attic.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:09.860]   But that stuff helped me qualify
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.180]   to be an accredited estate planner.
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.100]   Never got the designation,
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.740]   but I had all the qualifications.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.120]   And that stuff was pretty cool
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:21.480]   because it helped me to have this really interesting
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.060]   set of knowledge, of facts and information.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.040]   And then to do what my dream was,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.060]   which was to show people how they can achieve their goals
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.060]   more efficiently with this formal technical knowledge
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.100]   that is just really boring.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.580]   And so to do that just feels really good.
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.740]   And so it's really,
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.260]   I see, I have tremendous alignment
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:50.260]   between what I want to do, what my unique ability is,
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.820]   and what I do on a daily basis.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:55.860]   I'm personally convinced, at least for now,
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:00.860]   that my unique ability is to be a taxonomist of ideas
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.220]   and information.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:07.120]   The thing that I do really well is I can take a subject,
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.780]   I can start to study it,
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.820]   I can consume a vast amount of information
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:11.980]   about that subject,
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:14.140]   and then I can organize that information
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:18.400]   in a way that leads to solutions really, really quickly.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.100]   And this comes naturally to me.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:24.620]   It's what I've always done.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.800]   My friends joke, you want a 10 minute answer?
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.580]   Just ask Joshua a question on something and he'll tell you.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.700]   But the problem is, yes, it may be a 10 minute answer,
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:31.940]   which I always say, do you really want,
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.540]   do you want the answer or do you just, do you care?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.780]   But the 10 minute answer should, ideally,
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.340]   if I know what I'm talking about,
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.020]   it should lead to saying, here's what you need to know now.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.500]   Here's how you go through this in an orderly way
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.340]   that's not stupid,
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.420]   so you don't make a bunch of expensive mistakes.
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.820]   And here's where you do this.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.740]   It was with somebody yesterday
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:52.740]   and we're talking about buying gold.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.380]   And so many people approach these questions
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.820]   in what I think is a really dumb way.
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.380]   Should I do this or should I not do it?
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.700]   Well, it's not a matter of should you or shouldn't you,
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.900]   it's a matter of when should you?
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.860]   When does it make sense for you to do this certain thing?
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.980]   And so we need a few facts about your situation,
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.940]   but here's the basic timeline
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.780]   at which this particular thing makes sense.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:18.140]   And I've grown in my confidence in that a lot.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.580]   Simultaneously, I've grown to be,
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.960]   to feel like I'm falling behind.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.900]   One of the big ambitions that I have for the next 10 years
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.400]   is I, over the last few years,
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.620]   especially with all the travel and the work
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.020]   and the children, et cetera,
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.580]   is that I still read, I still study,
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.480]   but I'm far below what my former good study habits were.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.620]   And so there are a bunch of new areas
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.800]   that I wanna bone up on,
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.420]   that I wanna be able to help people in.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.980]   And I often get intimidated
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.700]   by the things that I'm getting rusty at.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.140]   I've gotten rusty at some of the things
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.280]   in financial planning.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.380]   I've lost that working knowledge
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.220]   of some of the important facts, et cetera.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.460]   And I don't wanna be rusty.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.420]   And so I'm gonna majorly,
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.540]   over the next decade, I'm gonna majorly
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.420]   tackle a bunch more,
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.780]   just studying.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.940]   I'm just gonna be studying a lot more.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.220]   So, why did I get into that?
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.000]   It's exciting to me because radical personal finance
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.580]   has given me a huge amount of freedom.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.020]   And that's been really rewarding.
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.020]   And it's so gratifying to get the stories that I get,
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.260]   the emails that I get,
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.220]   and to feel like my work is making a difference.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.920]   As a human, we're gonna spend
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.980]   the vast majority of our life working.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   That's what we do.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.240]   So, when you get to feel like your work matters,
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.780]   then it just gets even better.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.900]   And that's how I feel.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.300]   I feel like my work matters.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.700]   Changes though, there have been a lot of growth pains
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.380]   over the last 10 years.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.140]   My biggest frustration is just my lack of excellence
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.780]   in a lot of things.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.620]   I don't like to not do things well.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.460]   It's frustrating.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.660]   And of course, I know that you have to do
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.300]   not do things well to do them.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.420]   Better done poorly than most things
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.580]   but not done at all.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.180]   And so, I've practiced that.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.580]   But it does get really frustrating
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.840]   to not do things really well.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.340]   And probably the biggest change
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.500]   over the next 10 years for me,
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.520]   when I started radical personal finance,
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.140]   I was looking basically to escape, to get out.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.860]   And I wanted to build a lifestyle business.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.900]   And how I defined a lifestyle business was,
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.580]   I wanna build a business that provides me
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.620]   with a comfortable income that I can do
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.200]   from my laptop without anybody else.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.180]   I didn't want employees.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.260]   I didn't want a business, a big business.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.700]   I just wanted something that I did with my laptop
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.160]   that made a comfortable income.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.740]   My goal was $100,000.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.940]   I'm just gonna make $100,000.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.020]   If I can make $100,000 from my laptop,
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.860]   that covers what I need to do.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.300]   And I did not want a big staff.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.700]   I didn't want a big infrastructure.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.220]   I just wanted me and a laptop
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.060]   and I was okay with it being small.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.580]   Well, I did that.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.020]   I built that business.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.340]   And then I sat down and I said,
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:53.740]   well, I realized that it didn't feel right.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   It didn't feel like I was doing what I felt called to do.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:02.300]   And so what I've come to realize
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.740]   is that I need to build a much bigger business.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.860]   In order for me to do what I want to do,
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.100]   to have the impact that I want to have,
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.340]   I need to build a much bigger business.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.260]   And that lifestyle business thing dogged me for years
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.340]   of basically saying, that's not your goal.
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.620]   You'd stay small, stay small.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.020]   But it's just not,
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:28.220]   I basically came to the point where I said,
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.100]   no, I gotta build something bigger.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.540]   So in the coming decade,
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.460]   I'm going to build a much bigger business,
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.740]   hire more people to work with me,
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.660]   to expand my ability to keep me working in my unique ability
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:44.060]   and to expand out or to deliver more excellence.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:47.300]   I want people to get results faster.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.260]   I wanna get better results and I can't do it by myself.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.660]   So that's probably the biggest thing.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.340]   And it's been, I had to look for a number
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.020]   of different things before I was willing
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.460]   to commit to that in my head.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.620]   You know, a few years, sorry, a few months ago,
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.900]   I traveled back to the United States
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.260]   and I went and look at a farm that was for sale.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.020]   And my ambition for a number of years
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.500]   is to be a gentleman farmer.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.860]   There's still my ambition is to be a gentleman farmer.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.820]   I may wait till I'm old, I don't know.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.540]   But I wanted to have a farm and live on a farm
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.900]   and not a big commercial farm,
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.020]   but just a small little hobby farm.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.140]   And, but I didn't want to make,
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.780]   like I've never wanted to make farming my full-time thing.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.060]   I think it's an awesome lifestyle for some people,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.620]   but it's not for me.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.380]   Just wanted to live on a nice little farm out in the country
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.460]   in a nice little community, et cetera.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.140]   So I went a few months ago,
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.020]   I traveled to the United States to look at this small farm,
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.300]   about 20 acres, it was for sale.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.420]   And it's just sitting out there.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.500]   It's out in a rural area of the United States,
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.660]   one of my favorite areas up in the Rocky Mountains,
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.700]   Northern Rocky Mountains.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.260]   And I was sitting there, I walked out in the pasture
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.020]   and this place had basically everything.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.820]   Big house, the family had been there,
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.180]   raised children in it.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.420]   They were moving on, their children were grown
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.260]   and they were moving to another farm.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.700]   You know, they'd been self-sufficient,
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.220]   they raised beef cattle and chickens
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.580]   and a bunch of big garden, et cetera.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:21.580]   You know, a bunch of Mennonite and LDS neighbors
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.540]   and just like big homeschooling community and whatnot.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.340]   And it was perfect.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.740]   And I just sat out there and I sat in the pasture
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.060]   and I thought like, is this me?
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:31.900]   Is this what I'm gonna do?
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.660]   I'm gonna buy this farm.
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.380]   And I came to the conviction that like, I can't do it.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.220]   I couldn't do it in faith, that it just wasn't,
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:45.300]   it would be Joshua running away and hiding
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.220]   and disappearing and does nobody any good,
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:52.180]   which is not how I'm interested in living my life.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.740]   So I've abandoned that
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.020]   and I'm focusing on building a business.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.940]   And so one of the things that I have realized with that
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:05.780]   is the importance of having good local infrastructure.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.900]   Back to RVing.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.340]   RVing was very damaging to my business
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.020]   and my ability to be productive.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.460]   Not because I couldn't have leveraged it.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.260]   You know, I could have leveraged it for publicity.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.540]   I could have posted all our pictures on social media
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.140]   and done the like, hey, look how cool we are.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.660]   We're doing these things and here's how you can do it too.
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.900]   I could have done more with it,
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.860]   but I just didn't necessarily want to.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.380]   And it wasn't that it just hurt me
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:36.180]   with like the things that the foregone opportunities.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:39.380]   And now living outside of the United States,
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.420]   I tell you, like I love where I live,
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.900]   but everything is easier in the United States.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.140]   That's the biggest thing,
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.980]   that if you're an American living in the US,
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.940]   if you're ever tempted to complain about something,
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.980]   just reach out to me and I'll set you straight.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.340]   I'm happy to do that.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.940]   Everything in the US is so stinking easy.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.460]   It's so cheap to live there.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.180]   Everything is cheap, everything is easy.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.860]   And you think I'm being hyperbolic there.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.100]   I'm not, like it really is that way.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.460]   Now I've complained plenty, just like you do,
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.580]   about the things that aren't cheap
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.460]   and the things that aren't easy.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.540]   And there's a long way to go.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.780]   But when you compare to so many places around the world,
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.700]   there are places that have a few things better,
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.620]   but on the whole, things in the US are just cheap and easy.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.060]   And so when it comes to running a business,
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.460]   there's this major challenge
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460]   that I haven't figured out the answer to yet.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.500]   If I go back to the United States,
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.060]   which my guess is that I'll probably wind up
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.260]   back in the United States in the next year or two.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.180]   But if I go back to the United States,
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:41.340]   it comes with this whole set of benefits.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.420]   Raising children is easy.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.540]   Homeschooling is easy.
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.420]   Business, having the business infrastructure
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.180]   and what not is relatively easy.
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.900]   But it's not necessarily the best in the world
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.300]   and it's not necessarily cheap.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.380]   So I could go to another business location
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.780]   and set up things in another place.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.060]   But then it's hard.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.340]   Some things are cheaper and some things are not cheaper.
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.780]   So I haven't solved all those problems yet.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.140]   But my point is just simply that
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.660]   I just came to the firm conviction
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.660]   that I can't play small.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.860]   I'm not gonna play small.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:14.860]   And so I am devoted to doing as much as I can
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.540]   to serve as many people as I'm capable of
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:22.700]   just with the skills and abilities that I have.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.940]   I still struggle to figure out the progression
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.260]   of how to do those things.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:32.580]   I don't want to...
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.460]   I've learned as I get older,
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.660]   I'm learning to be more careful
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.980]   with the words that come out of my mouth.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.420]   The classic entrepreneur problem
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.660]   is having a billion ideas
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.540]   and not being able to execute on them.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.780]   And that's been always the challenge of my life
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:47.540]   is there are so many ideas.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.180]   And then I struggle to execute
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.540]   mostly because I haven't built the right team
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:54.100]   that helps me to execute on them.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.420]   And I get embarrassed when I say,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.660]   "Hey, look, here's this great idea.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.620]   "Here's this thing I'm gonna do."
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.700]   And then I don't execute on it.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.300]   So I'm gonna...
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.940]   I was going to talk about kind of what I'm planning to do
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.140]   over the next years.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.140]   But I'm just gonna be quiet on that for now
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.540]   and work a focus on executing and not talking about stuff.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.420]   So we'll see.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.980]   I don't, if I think about a decade,
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.860]   I don't think I'll be doing radical personal finance
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.900]   a decade from now.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.740]   I just don't think I will.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.180]   My goal is to do, is to create something.
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.060]   And I'm still a year,
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.700]   probably a year away from my thousandth episode.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.420]   But my goal is to create something
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.060]   in a set of somethings truly useful to help people.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:41.620]   And that's gonna take me at least several more years
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.740]   to do that and to really expand.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.900]   And who knows, maybe I will keep going for longer.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.500]   But then I think I'm gonna change to something else
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.420]   probably within a decade.
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.140]   So I don't know exactly how that's gonna look.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.940]   Maybe it'll look like I'll do this business
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.140]   for another six years, seven years, eight years,
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.900]   and then I'll close it.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:06.340]   And we'll buy a sailboat and spend a few years
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.620]   sailing around the world with my family.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.860]   I don't know.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.420]   But I do know that I'm not done yet.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.300]   So, and I've got a lot of work to do
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.380]   over the next few years.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.420]   And I'm excited about that work.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.460]   Most of what I've done in the last months
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.940]   and what I'm gonna be doing in the coming months
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.300]   is just simply orienting myself around my work
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.180]   is that I really take great joy
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.340]   in and I wanna produce better work,
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.420]   more helpful work, more useful work
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.300]   that serves more people.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.060]   I'm not gonna be a workaholic, don't worry.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.260]   I'll still do plenty of fun stuff.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:40.100]   But when I think about and dream about my future,
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.540]   I just still feel a responsibility and a burden
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.300]   to produce more useful work
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.580]   here in the context of radical personal finance.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:48.420]   There's some other brands,
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.460]   other things I'd like to delve into.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.460]   I got a whole bunch of domain names.
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.060]   And so we'll see.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.980]   And I don't wanna just do information publishing.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.020]   I like info publishing,
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.260]   but there's basically a set ceiling of info publishing.
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:05.260]   And I wanted to use that info publishing
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.100]   to help people develop more things.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.020]   'Cause I've come to think
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.660]   there are certain benefits of online businesses,
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.380]   there are certain benefits of information publishing.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:16.900]   They really do open up a lot of options.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.820]   But if I were starting over again,
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.740]   I can't say that I would start with online business.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.500]   I've come to see so many more opportunities
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.380]   with local brick and mortar businesses, et cetera,
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.820]   than just doing everything online.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:36.820]   And maybe we'll dig into that some other time.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.340]   I think I've shared with you
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.780]   most of what I intended to share.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.220]   It's been an awesome decade for me.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.460]   I'm excited.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.540]   And I guess probably the most important thing would be,
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.580]   maybe this is common to all people.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.420]   I don't know.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.100]   I've never been this age before, but I do know this.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.700]   That I feel like I'm hitting my stride.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.300]   And that's really, really a great feeling.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:05.100]   Having lacked self-confidence so much in the past
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.700]   and having felt like I was in these places
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.140]   that I wasn't a good fit for, et cetera,
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.340]   it feels really good to feel like I'm hitting my stride
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:19.340]   and to feel confident in my skill, my ability,
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.020]   and my clarity of thought, et cetera.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.660]   And that's really gratifying.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.140]   And so that's a place of confidence
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.980]   I think we all should operate from as much as possible.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.860]   And it just leads to a totally different set of experiences.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.700]   Now, not to say that you can't mess it all up.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.940]   Obviously you can.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.260]   But I've solved most of those problems
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.100]   with good financial planning.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   So it's just really exciting to feel that way.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.540]   And when I think about the phase that my family's at,
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.900]   when I think about the phase that I'm at,
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.180]   it's exciting to me.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:53.340]   And I'm incredibly excited about the future.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.740]   You know, this is gonna be such a fascinating year
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.820]   in our cultures.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.980]   It's gonna be such a fascinating year
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.340]   in the United States, an election year.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.380]   That's gonna be quite the ride.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.980]   And it's gonna be, you know,
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.180]   there's so many big financial stories going on.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:15.020]   There's interesting, you know, the stock market,
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.900]   the decade from the wonder decade.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.740]   You've got these tremendous financial numbers,
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:25.580]   but yet also incredible angst and concern.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.020]   You've got an incredibly more and more polarized society
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.620]   with just increasing public battles on just crazy stuff.
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:36.700]   Politics and cultural arguments, et cetera.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.220]   It's gonna be a remarkable decade
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.420]   that we're gonna live through, I think.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.460]   And yet in the middle of that,
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.420]   there's never been a time that I've seen more opportunity
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.060]   for individuals.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:54.940]   As noisy as the world is,
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.260]   and as many things pull at you,
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.420]   it's never been easier to be free, to live freely,
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.220]   as far as I can see.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.380]   I'm anticipating here in the beginning of January,
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.260]   I'm gonna lead the year off with this series
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.260]   called "Seven Rings of Freedom."
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.580]   Where if you care about being free, you can do it.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:17.400]   And I'm not gonna steal my thunder from that,
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.660]   but it's gonna be an amazing decade.
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.580]   And when I look around and see the opportunities
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.340]   for making money, just that in and of itself,
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.740]   for making a difference in the community, local community,
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.860]   there's just so many opportunities.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.300]   And so it's a very exciting time to be alive.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.820]   The world is getting flatter and flatter all the time,
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:39.300]   and it's exciting.
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.260]   And one of the things that I want very much to do,
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.500]   one of the reasons why I didn't buy that farm,
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.780]   is I just sat here and I said,
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.220]   "You know what, this is just gonna stick me out
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.660]   "in the middle of nowhere, and I'm gonna be,
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.240]   "yeah, I'll have the benefit of the local community,
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.900]   "but I won't be involved with where the growth is
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.340]   "in the world, and I can't run away from people.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.220]   "I can't run away and be a hermit.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.940]   "I need to be where the growth is."
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:08.080]   And so even just in my travel, in my investments,
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.600]   in my business activities, I wanna be more involved,
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.260]   especially with an international focus.
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:15.720]   And so I'm gonna be trying to figure out how to do that,
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.620]   'cause it's totally new, it doesn't involve,
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.700]   go buy a mutual fund, I gotta figure,
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.620]   I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm gonna try to learn.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.780]   And I wanna engage my children in that.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.020]   And when we think about what's happening
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.300]   culturally all over the world,
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.180]   when we think about what's happening
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.020]   with the big empires all over the world,
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.300]   when we think about what's happening
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.060]   with the religious trends all around the world,
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:41.820]   it's gonna be a pretty cool decade
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.460]   with a lot of stuff happening.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.800]   And so I'm excited to be there with you
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.920]   and to be doing it with you.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.840]   Thank you, I just wanna close today's show
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.480]   with just a simple thank you.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.000]   Thank you for being here.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.640]   I've said it already, but I find this work
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.600]   to be enormously gratifying.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.280]   And it's deeply encouraging to me
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.320]   to know that my thoughts, my ideas
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.920]   have had an impact on your life.

[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:16.220]   it's such a blessing.

[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.600]   Thank you for listening.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.420]   I appreciate you and I appreciate your being here.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.160]   Happy New Year, 2020.
