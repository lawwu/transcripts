[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.520]   We got one here from Peyton.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.000]   Peyton says, do you have suggestions for high schoolers?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.840]   At my school, we have to check our email daily
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.400]   to receive updates from our teachers,
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080]   and we rely heavily on our computers.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.640]   Are there tips you would have for students like me?
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.280]   I do have tips for students.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.440]   The idea that you have to check your email once a day
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.680]   for updates from your teachers is not your problem.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.520]   The fact that, yes, there's work you
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.640]   do during the school day on your Chromebook is not your problem.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.000]   Here's the things that I'm going to tell you matter.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.160]   And it's what you were doing voluntarily with your time
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.760]   and how you were voluntarily engaging with the digital world
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.560]   that matters.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.360]   So here are the rules.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.280]   And I say rules.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.720]   I mean, you can listen to them or you not.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.440]   But I'm saying this is what I would suggest.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.200]   If I was a high schooler and I'm thinking,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.600]   I want a deeper life, I don't want
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.800]   to just be anxious and lost in my screen all the time.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.160]   Number one, don't play online video games.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   I'm not against video games in general as a distraction.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.600]   But the ones where you're online and there's
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400]   lots of other people on them--
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.160]   in Roblox, I'm looking at you.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.480]   The-- I don't know these things.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.560]   Fortnite, I'm looking at you.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.200]   World of Warcraft, is that still a thing?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.920]   Look, I don't know games.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.320]   But the ones in which there's lots
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.520]   of people who are online on a shared server
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.720]   are some of the most addictive technologies ever created
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.160]   by man.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.240]   If you study digital addiction, these can be the worst.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.440]   These are the worst.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.160]   It's not social media.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.920]   It's not I'm on YouTube too much.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.840]   The thing that can cause I have to go to a rehab center
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.560]   level of addiction is actually these massive multiple online
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.280]   games.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560]   It's going to eat up your life.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.320]   There's better things you can be doing with that time.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.520]   You get very little return in the sense of connection,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240]   growth, resilience, character, skills.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   You get nothing out of the time you spend when
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.760]   you're five hours in Fortnite.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.520]   Don't do online video games.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.440]   Second, don't do social media.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.720]   You can use your phone to communicate with your friends.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.880]   And this is the good news.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.280]   And this is a change that has happened
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   since when I first started researching
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.280]   my book, Digital Minimalism.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120]   And today, back then, social media platforms
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.680]   were critical to teen socialization.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.640]   Snapchat in particular was really big.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.800]   That has changed today.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.680]   The socialization has largely migrated off
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.960]   of social media platforms, especially for teenagers.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.720]   They use text messaging and instant messaging tools.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.360]   The social media platforms are more
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.920]   about distraction, entertainment,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.160]   keeping up with cultural memes.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.320]   Just don't use those.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.440]   Communicate with your friends on WhatsApp and text
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   or whatever you need to do so you can make plans
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.840]   and know when the party is.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.960]   But don't use the other ones.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.360]   Yeah, TikTok is interesting.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.080]   But TikTok is also designed from the ground up
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.880]   to be like one of those pods in The Matrix
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.280]   where you're in a bathtub full of goo
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.520]   and a robot alien has stuck a needle straight
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.640]   into your spine.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   It's just engineered from the ground up
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.160]   to just press buttons and keep you looking at that screen.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.720]   And God forbid, if you are posting on TikTok,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.040]   they don't even try to hide what they're doing there.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   They are playing entirely with the weak spots
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.000]   of your adolescent brain to make you completely addicted.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.920]   Here's what happens if you start using TikTok.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.960]   You post a few videos.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.880]   They have this all figured out.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   They will wait until your second or third video.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.120]   And then the algorithm is going to expose that video
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.840]   to a bunch of people's feeds.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.280]   And what do you see?
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.600]   You see a big burst of views.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   And you start to suspect,
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.560]   hey man, maybe I'm onto something.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.640]   You know, maybe people dig what I'm doing here.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.960]   I kind of have a bit of an audience.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.640]   And oh man, the next one didn't get that.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.480]   The next one didn't get it.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.400]   The algorithm gives you another burst of views.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.760]   Oh, that one caught on.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.720]   All right, man, this is important.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   Now I know I got my audience.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.560]   I got to be on there.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.480]   People really care about me.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.400]   You are being 100% manipulated.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.440]   They control exactly how many views you get.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.840]   The algorithm has figured out how to titrate bursts
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.160]   of fake simulated popularity so that you think
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.880]   that you're one slot machine pull away
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.760]   from being an influencer.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.480]   All the while they are just, here's your pocket,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.760]   money, money, money, money.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.600]   So just don't use it, man.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.440]   Just don't use it.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.280]   Don't use social media.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.680]   Don't use online video games.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.800]   Counter this by aggressively going
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   after autonomously chosen positive social pursuits.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.920]   If you're in any way athletic,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.160]   get on a sports team and get serious about it.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.720]   And you might have to do some exploration
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.920]   to find what sports team that is.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.720]   I mean, if you look at my history,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.360]   I played all the rec sports.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120]   I came from a family that said,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   you always got to be in a sport
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.360]   because otherwise you're bouncing off the walls.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.200]   And it's a pain.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.400]   And I played soccer, I played basketball,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   I played baseball and I was terrible at all of them.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.360]   But then at some point in high school,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.520]   I realized I had the right type of leg muscle fibers to run.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.080]   I got really in the track and track got me into crew.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   And that made a big difference.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.440]   So if you can do anything athletic
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.120]   and it might take some discovery, do that.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.240]   If you're not athletic, that's fine.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.360]   Find something else, a team, you can be involved in this
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.400]   when you work with other people towards building skills
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.560]   in the competitive situation where things could go wrong,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.360]   but you feel the victories when you have the victories
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.880]   and you're working together on it.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.040]   And you need this in your life.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.600]   Positive skilled social pursuits
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.800]   that you can put a lot of energy into
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.160]   and to give you a lot back in return.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.600]   That's where you want to be spending your time.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.560]   Do that and also spending time with your friends
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.240]   and figuring out how to be a social human being
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   and going to those parties
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.720]   where you're not quite sure if you should be in the party
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.840]   and try to navigate that social difficulty.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.680]   That's just calisthenics for your social brain.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.000]   You need to do that so that you're not weird
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   when you're an adult, that's all great.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.400]   Don't spend five hours on an online video game.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.520]   Don't be tricked by the TikTok algorithm
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.120]   into thinking that you are six dance videos away
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.200]   from being Kim Kardashian.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.240]   You're not, you're in the tub of goo
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.440]   and there's a thing in the back of your neck.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.080]   And I think this is easier now than it was five years ago
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.040]   because socialization as a teenager
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.640]   does not require you to be on these services.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.600]   That now happens separately.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.840]   Honestly, even if you have a flip phone,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.240]   get the phone where you can still text,
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.400]   but you can't go on apps.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   That's becoming the new counter-cultural thing,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.080]   by the way, especially if you have some other thing
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.760]   you do really well, like you're an athlete
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.280]   or on the robotics team or something like this.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.120]   You're like, yeah, I don't bother
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.760]   with that smartphone stuff.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.320]   That doesn't make you the weird loner anymore.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.000]   That makes you kind of the cooler guy.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.680]   So if you're doing that,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.120]   and if you very strongly ignore my advice from earlier
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.800]   to say, "Deeple meeple" when you run into people,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.960]   I think you'll be okay.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.640]   (upbeat music)
