[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   If Scientology was just getting auditing,
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.760]   when you wanted, about the subjects you wanted,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.800]   and you could take it or leave it, that would be fine.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.980]   It's the fact that it's part and parcel
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.060]   to this entire organization and this entire experience
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.100]   that has, as a part of that experience,
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.720]   taking everything from you, demanding everything from you,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.220]   controlling who you can speak with,
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.360]   controlling who you can have relationships with,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.240]   who you have to erase from your life.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.520]   This is where, and it's hard to place one pinpoint on,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.400]   this is where Scientology goes wrong.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.760]   It's really hard to do that,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.120]   because the good parts of Scientology
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.520]   and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.640]   The following is a conversation with Aaron Smith-Levin,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.560]   a former Scientologist raised in Scientology
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.040]   and have worked in the organization full-time
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.540]   for many years as a staff member and a C-Org member,
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.940]   including the job of training Scientology auditors.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.700]   Today, he educates the public about Scientology
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.020]   on his YouTube channel called Growing Up in Scientology.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.940]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.100]   in the description.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Aaron Smith-Levin.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500]   Let's do a full overview of Scientology,
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.440]   its ideas, how it operates,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.840]   how it wields its power and influence.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.400]   And let's start at the very basics.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.040]   What is Scientology?
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   - Scientology is a belief system created by L. Ron Hubbard
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.520]   that does fundamentally believe
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.760]   that we are all immortal spiritual beings called thetans,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   that we have native godlike potential,
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.480]   that there is nothing more powerful
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.560]   in the universe than a thetan.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.540]   So godlike is quite literal here.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.580]   And that through various decisions thetans have made,
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.980]   they have fallen away from their native godlike power
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.380]   to falling down to a state where most thetans
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.880]   aren't even aware that they are thetans,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.220]   aren't even aware that they ever have lived before
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.780]   or have these powers,
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.740]   and that thetans are now in a state
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.980]   where they're trapped in bodies, trapped here on Earth,
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.020]   trapped in this prison of a physical universe,
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.780]   trapped on this prison of a planet,
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.100]   and that only Scientology can restore a thetan
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.940]   to its native state.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.340]   - Are these multiple beings?
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.040]   Like is there one thetan inside of me
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.980]   that's trapped in this prison?
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.300]   - Well, the thing would be you.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.260]   - The thing would be me.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.940]   - The thetan is you.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.300]   - But I'm presumably limited in some fundamental way.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.860]   So this thetan that is me is limited.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.800]   So there's like eight billion thetans on the planet.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.220]   - There's one primary thetan animating each body.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.940]   Later in Scientology you learn there's actually
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.100]   like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   of like sick, unconscious, half-dead thetans stuck to you
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.300]   that are now an additional cause of problems for you.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.140]   - Sure.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.220]   - But fundamentally at the lower levels,
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.680]   the non-confidential levels,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.380]   there's just one thetan per body.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.920]   - I mean, it's an interesting idea.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.080]   I just would like to kind of explore the philosophy of that.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.700]   So there's a being that's all-powerful that's immortal,
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.880]   and its projection, its manifestation on this Earth
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.720]   is fundamentally limited.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.280]   And you're trying to, the process of Scientology
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.800]   is the process of letting go of those limitations.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.240]   You know, that's an interesting idea.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.480]   I mean, a lot of religions have this kind of idea
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.760]   that there's, not just religions,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.240]   but like we have the capacity as human beings
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.480]   to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   And that's the question we have
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.080]   with our cognitive abilities.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.280]   We start with an embryo and build up and into this organism
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.520]   and like this world of opportunities before us,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   what are we capable of?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.000]   And the idea that we're capable of almost anything
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.960]   is a really powerful one.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.480]   And there's a lot of religions,
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.560]   there's a lot of philosophies,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.840]   there's a lot of advice, self-help
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.440]   that kind of explore those ideas.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.560]   And so, it seems like with Scientology,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.400]   the application of this religious philosophy
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   means that we're limited
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.480]   and we have to break through those limitations.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.840]   And there's a process to break through those limitations.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.080]   - That would be correct.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.440]   So, what can make it challenging to adequately
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.160]   and completely describe Scientology in the beginning
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.280]   is what Scientologists believe actually changes
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   as they progress further into or further up in Scientology.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.480]   So, the explanation is that I've given it
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.920]   is pretty consistent with what you would get
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.520]   at the lowest levels, right?
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.480]   You're a thetan, I'm a thetan, everyone's a thetan.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.360]   And we have a reactive mind.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.560]   L. Ron Hubbard would say the reactive mind
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.840]   is a collection of these recordings,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.160]   mental recordings of any moments of pain and unconsciousness
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.320]   you've ever had in your life.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.660]   It's like the subconscious mind.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.080]   It's always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.440]   and that these recordings,
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   L. Ron Hubbard called them engrams.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.120]   Now, when L. Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in 1950,
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.080]   this was before Scientology came along
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.360]   a couple years later, right?
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.120]   So, in 1950, when he wrote Dianetics,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.200]   it wasn't a spiritual endeavor.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.040]   It was supposed to be a mental health,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.960]   a science of mental health.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   So, as of that time, the earliest engram you could have
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.240]   was the incident of birth, being born was an engram.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.200]   And technically, in Dianetics,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.240]   he said you could have prenatal engrams,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.900]   like when you're still in the womb.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.080]   But there was no concept of past lives
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.660]   as of 1950 version of Dianetics, right?
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.760]   And so, the idea there was that the reactive mind
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   is essentially a stimulus response mechanism
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.040]   created through evolution millions of years ago
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.680]   to protect the individual from things that would harm them.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.760]   In other words, things that would bring about
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.700]   pain and unconsciousness.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.120]   So, you have these recordings of things that hurt you,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.320]   create pain and unconsciousness,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.280]   and in present time, these things will react upon you
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.200]   in a way to cause you to avoid similar things
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   reacting upon you in a subconscious, unconscious way.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.260]   - So, the reactive mind protects you from the trauma
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.220]   that is inside your subconscious mind.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.400]   - Yes, and the idea is we've now,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.080]   as human beings, evolved to a state
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.800]   where it no longer serves us beneficially.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.420]   It only serves us negatively.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.120]   This was Hubbard's theory.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.300]   And he said, "So, you can get rid of these engrams
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.740]   by basically recalling them and going over them
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.080]   again and again using Dianetics auditing therapy.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.240]   And if you get back to the moment of birth
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.080]   and erase the earliest engram,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.480]   all the other subsequent engrams on the chain would vanish."
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.960]   - Oh, nice, so there's a chain.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.320]   - Early or similar, early or similar,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.960]   early or similar, early or similar, okay.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.080]   So, that gives you a pretty good understanding
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.320]   of how L. Ron Hubbard thought of the mind
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.760]   because that carries on,
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.080]   has applicability later on in Scientology.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.400]   - I mean, that's a pretty powerful model of the mind.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.960]   I mean, Freud had similar conceptions
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.480]   that a lot of our traumas are grounded in
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.820]   poor formulation of sexuality
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.920]   or imperfect formulation of sexuality,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.040]   you know, childhood, something like this.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.080]   And then we're trying to figure out the puzzle
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.840]   of whatever we formed in early childhood.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.680]   - Right. - I mean, it's similar.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.400]   Similar kind of-- - It is similar.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.960]   Probably what Hubbard took it from.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.280]   In the early days of Dianetics,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.880]   before he decided psychiatry was evil,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.840]   he actually credited Sigmund Freud
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.840]   with some of the shoulders he was standing on
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.060]   in writing Dianetics.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.240]   - So, he still admired psychiatry at that time.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.800]   So, that's an interesting moment of Dianetics.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.640]   So, what else?
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.900]   You mentioned Dianetics auditing was there too.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.960]   So, if we just, before Scientology,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   what are the ideas that formed what we know as Dianetics?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.480]   - As I've just described, that is the fundamental.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.680]   - That is. - That is pretty much
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.000]   the nuts and bolts of Dianetics.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.040]   - Was it applied?
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.680]   Was it applied often?
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.380]   - Oh yeah, no, that's what Dianetics in the early days
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.720]   was all about, was just auditing.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.980]   Auditing is the process of the one-on-one counseling,
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.600]   recall a moment of pain and unconsciousness,
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.320]   run through the engram over and over and over again,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.400]   find something earlier, similar.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.000]   That is Dianetics auditing.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.120]   One of the main things that changed with Scientology
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.360]   is that birth or prenatal engrams
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.320]   were no longer the earliest engrams on the chain.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.840]   The idea is you have to get the earliest engram
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.820]   on the chain for the later ones to blow, which is a race.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.180]   And so, but all of a sudden now,
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.800]   with the addition of an immortal spiritual being
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.440]   into the equation, well now the earliest incident
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.720]   could be trillions of years ago
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.520]   in other galaxies and universes.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.400]   - Other universes?
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.080]   So, before the origin of this universe?
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.920]   - Yes.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.960]   - Is there a model of physics integrated in any of this?
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.020]   - No.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.880]   The model is you have the physical universe,
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.140]   and then above that you have the theta universe.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.220]   So, we used the word thetan earlier.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.580]   So, in Scientology, they'll use the word theta.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.620]   Theta is just basically thetan power.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.620]   Thetans collectively.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.460]   So, Hubbard would say you have the theta universe,
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.700]   which is senior to the physical universe,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.340]   and creates the physical universe.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.420]   And remember, I said native god-like potentials.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.840]   So, we're not talking about the god who created the Earth.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.900]   We're just, like Scientologists don't believe in a god,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.100]   but we'll get into that later.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.680]   We're talking about just creating universes.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.140]   Like, just think like Matrix.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.840]   Like, just, when I say creating a universe,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.500]   essentially just creating different thetan simulations.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.780]   - But it sounds like a little bit more
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.100]   like the ideas of Plato,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.260]   which is there's these platonic forms,
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.740]   there's abstract forms that are bigger, more general
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.420]   than our particular reality here,
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.140]   and those forms are used to construct the reality.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.960]   - Well, I grew up in a cult,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.700]   so I'm not familiar with the works of Plato.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.660]   (laughing)
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.740]   - You can't use that as an excuse for everything.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.780]   I would like to, you know, non-jokingly steal a man the case
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.100]   because a lot of philosophies, a lot of religions,
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.620]   a lot of even scientific endeavors
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.660]   are a little bit full of uncertainty.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.380]   You can call it bullshit, but you're on unsteady ground
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.140]   because we're surrounded by mystery.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.200]   And you have to take these ideas somewhat seriously
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.360]   and see where those ideas go wrong.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.620]   This happens with communism, this happens with capitalism.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.080]   These ideas sound beautiful in their ideal forms,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.600]   and then they somehow go wrong,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.480]   and some go more wrong than others.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.080]   And so I don't think, sort of, it's easy to
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.480]   sort of caricature and make fun of the ideas.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   I think if you take them seriously,
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.200]   you'll start to understand, like,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.380]   when you're in it, it was serious.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.980]   It can be very convincing.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.740]   It's, you know, the devil is going
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.940]   to be a charismatic person.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.500]   He's not going to be a caricature, a ridiculous person.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.180]   So that helps us understand which ideas
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.500]   will sound appealing but will become dangerous.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.340]   - I totally agree.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.480]   In fact, it's one of the
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.740]   thrusts I have on my channel,
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.140]   is wanting to talk about Scientology in a way
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.440]   that would actually resonate with current Scientologists,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.820]   not just resonate with former Scientologists.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.260]   I want people who are still in
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.180]   to be able to hear how I talk about it and go,
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.580]   "Wow, he's being really fair and really accurate.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.620]   "He's not just a hater," you know what I mean?
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.900]   - If you look at the, you know,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.940]   let's take one of the worst places on Earth is North Korea.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.540]   You have Kim Jong-un.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.220]   And the reality is there's a lot of citizens of that nation
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.860]   that deeply love the leader,
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.500]   because they've grew up in that way.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.020]   And you, I mean, through fear,
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.100]   through all kinds of manipulation,
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.120]   through propaganda and so on,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.420]   they're not allowed to love members of their own family.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.760]   They're not allowed to have romantic love.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.820]   They're only allowed to have love for the leader.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.280]   And to reach those people,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.460]   you have to empathize with the fact that,
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.940]   in their eyes, in some sense, this is a great man.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.280]   This is a god, a messianic figure.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.240]   You can't just make fun of the ridiculousness
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.960]   of the situation that there's this pudgy person
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.120]   waltzing around creating propaganda.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.680]   Like, how is this-- - With a funny haircut.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.640]   - With a funny haircut.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.240]   Like, it's so easy, and Hitler too,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.960]   to make fun of, to make a caricature of the person.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.800]   But this is a real person,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.580]   a real person that influenced the minds
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.780]   of millions of people.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.040]   In the case of Hitler, you know,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.580]   tens of millions of people,
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.140]   and created a huge amount of suffering.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.460]   Not because of the caricature version,
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.020]   but because he was a charismatic leader.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.340]   He was somebody that people deeply, deeply loved.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.100]   And that just, over time, I mean,
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.380]   with the abuse of any kind of ideology,
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.340]   this happens over and over.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.380]   And so, yeah, it's interesting,
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.380]   because Scientology is so close to the core
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.260]   of what is America, because so many Americans
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.100]   are involved with it.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.080]   So it's interesting to study the beauty
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.260]   and the power of the ideas that underlie it,
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.660]   and where things go wrong.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.780]   - Yeah.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.380]   And I'll just say, it's interesting to note,
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.380]   you would never get a representative
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.100]   of the Church of Scientology to sit down
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.020]   and have a conversation with you,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.200]   and even be as fair and accurate about Scientology
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.100]   as I'm going to be, which is noteworthy.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.060]   - Do you honestly, deeply believe that's the case?
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.260]   There's not going to be a high-level official
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.400]   that would sit down for a conversation?
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.220]   - No.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.420]   - I disagree with you.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.420]   - I hope you're right.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.140]   - Because I think that, given the current dynamics
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.820]   of what's happening, I think in order to say,
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.940]   from their perspective, in order to save
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.400]   the Church of Scientology, they have to be
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.660]   transparent and authentic, basically still
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.360]   mend their case, but better.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.020]   - You would think so.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.420]   - Well, we'll talk about the other ways you could do that,
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.180]   which is through manipulation, through propaganda,
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.820]   through controlled media, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.680]   - They paint themselves into a corner
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.100]   of not being able to send a representative
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.800]   out into the world to speak honestly about it,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.900]   because you're literally not allowed to.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.420]   So when faced, you know, if you're just sitting down
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.220]   with an entertainment journalist,
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.900]   a representative might be able to fudge their way
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.380]   through an interview, but sitting down
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.740]   for a long-form format interview with someone
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.120]   who is gonna ask them about Zinu and the body thetans
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.820]   and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson, that's a no-go zone.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.220]   So I'm representing why it will never happen,
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.100]   but shit, I would tune in for that interview.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.700]   I mean, I hope you do get someone.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.300]   - You don't think David Miscavige would sit down
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.480]   for an interview?
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.660]   - I would love to be wrong.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.340]   - You know, in general, journalists in these kinds
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.340]   of situations can be, can attack in ways
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.780]   that doesn't empathize and doesn't come from a place
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.620]   of deep knowledge and understanding.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.380]   And I think it's possible to have serious conversations
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.580]   with people like that in an empathetic way,
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.140]   but it's also in a challenging way.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.700]   I think there's a huge amount of trust required.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.820]   And obviously for a very secretive organization,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.620]   the amount of trust, yes, might be too much required.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.740]   - Anyone over there, if they've done their homework knows,
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.540]   you're gonna be as fair as anyone
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.220]   in the world's going to be.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.220]   And yet, they're simply things they're not allowed
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.940]   to talk about, and they're not even allowed to say,
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.260]   I'm not allowed to talk about it.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.620]   - So that's a fundamental part of the church
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.340]   of Scientology is the secrecy.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.420]   - Yeah.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.140]   - So that's where you're trained as you go up
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.100]   through the ranks, is secrecy, secrecy.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.140]   - It's not even a matter of training.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.000]   It's that there's an entire, the entire upper half
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.700]   of Scientology's bridge is simply confidential.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.340]   I mean, and I never even did those levels
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.500]   when I was in Scientology.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.680]   I didn't learn what Scientologists actually believe
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.400]   on those upper levels until after I got out of Scientology,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.500]   and I was fricking born and raised in it.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.340]   - Let's go there.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.420]   Let's go to your personal story.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.360]   So you've spent 30 years in Scientology.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.200]   - Yeah, I was four years old when my mom got in.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.320]   - And then about seven years ago, got out.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.160]   - Yeah.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.140]   - And you're on what, YouTube channel now?
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.420]   And you're an educator.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.320]   - So I was four years old when my mom got introduced
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.400]   to Scientology, and she got in really fast, really quick.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.720]   So, but I was 12 years old when I was taken out of school
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.600]   and started officially full-time working for Scientology.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.480]   Okay, so in various capacities, I worked for them
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.640]   from the ages of 12 to the age of 26.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.480]   - Yeah.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   - Okay, so, and then I was 34 when I officially
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.860]   parted ways with Scientology, which was really more
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.200]   them officially parting ways with me,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.800]   but we can get into all that later.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.400]   That's just kinda how Scientology does it.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   - And what do you do now in terms of Scientology?
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.400]   - So now I run, growing up in Scientology,
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.920]   the YouTube channel, but what I primarily do
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.380]   is I help run an organization that helps people
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.120]   who are escaping from Scientology.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.280]   I'm the vice president of the Aftermath Foundation.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.960]   And we created the foundation after the television show
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.880]   Leah Remini, Scientology in the Aftermath.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.520]   And there was such an outpouring of support
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.000]   from non-Scientologists all over the world.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.460]   What can we do to help people leave Scientology?
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.920]   That we decided to create a foundation,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.160]   and it's been incredibly successful.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.920]   We've helped people escape from all regions
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.920]   and echelons of Scientology.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.840]   We've accomplished, what we've accomplished
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.560]   is far beyond what we actually envisioned
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.400]   would be possible.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.680]   It's been a huge success.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.840]   - So we'll talk about the negative aspect,
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.880]   the abuses of power, but let's just explore
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.960]   the ideas a little bit more.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   So the public facing three fundamental truths
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.280]   of Scientology, maybe correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.000]   Man is an immortal spiritual being,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.960]   like we said with Thetans.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.840]   His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime,
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.960]   so infinite memory backwards.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.600]   His capabilities are unlimited,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.280]   even if not presently realized.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.600]   The capabilities are unlimited.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.860]   - So when I say godlike, I really just mean,
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.480]   you know, Thanos, like unlimited.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.460]   Scientologists don't believe in a god.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.800]   So when I say godlike, I just mean the most powerful entity,
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.960]   the creator, the prime mover unmoved,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.440]   except we are all that.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.520]   You know, a Thetan in Scientology,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.000]   a Thetan has no position in space or time.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.040]   A Thetan does not actually exist in the physical universe.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.560]   It might choose to locate itself
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.520]   in the physical universe, right?
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.220]   And then forget that it made that decision
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.660]   and then sort of get caught and trapped
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.960]   in the physical universe.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   But that once the Thetan is restored to its native powers,
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.080]   everything you see here in the physical universe
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.540]   is just a Thetan playing a game.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.440]   Like literally, we are in a simulation right now
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.360]   of some Thetan.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.420]   So like physics doesn't have to make sense
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.640]   when we're talking about it this way.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.360]   Like technically you're a Thetan, I'm a Thetan, we're here,
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.960]   but this could also all just be another Thetan's game.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.400]   - So Thetan's all the way down.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.080]   - Yeah, it's just Thetan's everywhere,
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.260]   Thetan's, it all comes down to the Thetan.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.360]   - Is there an idea of a god?
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.040]   'Cause I read there's a kind of,
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.320]   there is a sense of a supreme being.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   Is that basically the Thetan that's at the core,
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.360]   at the bottom of it all?
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.200]   - Yes.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.940]   - Not defined, undefined.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.780]   - Correct.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.980]   Scientology has this concept of the dynamics,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.740]   how Ron Hubbard breaks life into eight different dynamics.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   And the dynamic meaning a thrust towards survival.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.820]   So he would say, you know, the first dynamic is you yourself,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.180]   second dynamic is your family,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.140]   third dynamic is any other group
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.900]   that you're a part of other than your family.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.300]   Fourth dynamic is all humankind.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.980]   The fifth dynamic is plant and animal life,
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.020]   all non-human life.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.460]   Sixth dynamic is the physical world.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.900]   Seventh dynamic is sort of like spirituality,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.580]   collectively, Thetans, us as Thetans.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.540]   And the eighth dynamic,
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.380]   Al Ron Hubbard says,
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.300]   "Scientology doesn't deal with the eighth dynamic."
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.780]   But we recognize that people have this idea
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.420]   of a supreme being.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.700]   And so Scientology says,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.700]   "You can call the eighth dynamic the supreme being dynamic,
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.420]   "but we call it infinity."
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.460]   Just the allness of everything without having to define it.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.140]   And then they sort of do a little dance
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.080]   and they're like, "Scientology,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.580]   "the purpose of Scientology is to get you to the point
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.220]   "where you have your own understandings or realizations
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.040]   "about the nature of the eighth dynamic.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.700]   "We don't tell you what you have to believe about that."
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.140]   And technically speaking, that is true.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.580]   Technically speaking, that is true.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.500]   There's no point in Scientology where they sit you down
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.380]   and say you're now required to revoke your belief
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.580]   in a supreme being.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.300]   It's just that everything in Scientology
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   is inconsistent with a belief in the supreme being.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.940]   You can still find Scientologists
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.260]   who, through cognitive dissonance,
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.900]   will tell you they believe in a supreme being.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.620]   Mostly, they're lying to you.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.340]   - How is this inconsistent with a supreme being?
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.380]   'Cause like, thetans--
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.940]   - Because thetans have created everything, not God.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.060]   - Okay, so thetans created, they're also a creative force.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.900]   They're not just the force that runs everything.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.740]   - Right.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.220]   - But can't those be just the fingertips of a God?
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.180]   - Sure.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.580]   The only way you could reconcile a supreme being
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.580]   is if you say a single supreme being created all theta.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.340]   - Yeah.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.860]   - Like the spiritual Big Bang.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.700]   - Yep.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.620]   - But that's not what most people think
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.420]   when they talk about God.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.580]   They're talking about a creator of--
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.580]   - The physical universe.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.420]   - Yes.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.380]   - That there's no theta.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.820]   - Right.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.420]   I mean, even as I've described Scientology so far,
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.620]   none of what I've said is something
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.540]   I even subject to ridicule.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.140]   This is pretty common sense stuff, actually.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.100]   I mean, if you believe in spirituality or spirits at all,
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.700]   there's nothing I've described so far that's crazy.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.540]   - Yeah.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.980]   - You know, believing in past lives
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.100]   isn't particularly unique or special.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.500]   - Right.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.940]   - The fact that Scientology does this little dance
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.100]   of pretending to believe in a God,
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.580]   I mean, it's even like a PR line.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.700]   Scientology representatives will tell you
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.020]   you can be a Christian and be a Scientologist.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.100]   Well, let me tell you what.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.180]   Christians don't believe in past lives
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.620]   and lives on other galaxies and planets and universes.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.700]   And Scientology knows that.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.320]   Scientology knows you can't be a Christian
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.060]   and be a Scientologist, but they will say that.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.500]   It's just an example of sort of the fundamental
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.580]   baked in dishonesty.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.300]   - Because it's so important to Scientology
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.420]   on the organization level to have tax exempt status,
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.780]   I wonder, do you know the process of what it takes
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.660]   to prove that an organization is a religion?
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.020]   - While going through that process with the IRS,
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.340]   for the second time, by the way,
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.620]   Scientology actually had tax exemption in the early days
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.260]   and the IRS pulled it, and then they got it back in 1993.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.260]   While going through that process again,
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.500]   the IRS actually took issue with the fact
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.380]   that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.580]   and a member of another religion.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.820]   The IRS actually said, pump the brakes there.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.820]   If you're gonna say that,
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.940]   we're gonna say you're not a religion.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.780]   And they actually put in writing to the IRS,
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.980]   no, no, no, no, no, that's not what we meant.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.220]   That's not what we meant.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.460]   We meant in the beginning, you can be both,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.300]   but eventually, you just have to be a Scientologist.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.780]   - So you mentioned the eight dynamics,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.600]   but you also mentioned survival.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.700]   So that seems to be a core principle
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.180]   that human existence is about survival.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.580]   Can you elaborate what is meant by survival?
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.700]   Are we talking about the survival of the human species,
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.740]   survival of the individual humans,
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.740]   survival of the manifestation of thetans in human form?
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.660]   What's survival?
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.780]   - So it would be all of that,
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.260]   because survival is the dominant force
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.540]   across all the dynamics.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.620]   L. Ron Hubbard, it was either Dianetics
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.220]   or Science of Survival.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.300]   He says he discovered the principle
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.420]   upon which all life exists,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.260]   and that is all life, no matter what it is trying to do,
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.660]   are you ready, Lex?
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.380]   It's trying to survive.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.620]   - That's pretty powerful.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.460]   That's pretty powerful.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.300]   (Lex laughing)
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.140]   - Is it?
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.660]   - No, I gotta tell you, I gotta--
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.020]   - You might get me back in, Lex.
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.800]   - No, I'm not trying to get you back in.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.860]   I'm trying to get you to take seriously
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.220]   the power of the ideas behind Scientology,
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.740]   because I think those ideas are not bad ideas.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.460]   They resonate with a lot of ideas throughout philosophy,
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.280]   throughout religions,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.660]   throughout the history of human civilization.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.140]   The interesting aspect is how it goes wrong.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.460]   - But here's the thing, Lex, here's the thing.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.140]   It is consistent with prior efforts or studies.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.700]   It's just that L. Ron Hubbard said
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.140]   this was a watershed breakthrough
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.820]   that was being discovered for the first time.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.620]   That's kind of what I'm mocking, really.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.820]   - Yeah, but you can mock Nietzsche for saying,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.260]   "Man is will to power."
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.100]   You can mock Freud.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.980]   - But did he claim to be the first person to ever say it?
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.380]   - Well, Nietzsche, he had a bit of an ego, so.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.460]   (Lex laughing)
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.660]   And he's full of contradictions,
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.900]   but I'm pretty sure the implied thing
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.340]   is that he was the first to say it.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.500]   There's a lot of scientists.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.180]   There's one of the people I really admire,
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.060]   Stephen Wolfram, who wrote a book
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.100]   called "A New Kind of Science"
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.540]   that explores complex systems and cellular automata
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.740]   and these mathematical systems
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.460]   that have been explored before,
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.380]   but he boldly kind of defined,
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.420]   "I am presenting to you a whole new way
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.620]   "to look at the world."
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.620]   And if you just set a little bit of the ego
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   behind that aside,
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.460]   there's actually beautiful ideas in there.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.020]   They have, of course, been done before and explored before,
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.140]   but sometimes people declare this is the coolest.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.840]   - That's the only thing I'm really mocking is he said,
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.240]   "This discovery that life is trying to survive
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.220]   "is greater than the discovery of fire."
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.300]   Okay, I mean, it gets a little silly, but that's fine.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.420]   We can agree that the fact that life is trying to survive
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.660]   has meaning and is meaningful and is valuable,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.020]   and it's true.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.660]   I mean, life is trying to survive.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.180]   - Also, there's a non-trivial definition
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.120]   of what is life here.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.620]   So this idea of a thing that permeates through lifetimes,
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.220]   through people, there's some fabric
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.340]   that is bigger than the individual biological bags of meat.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.100]   That's a philosophically interesting idea.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.340]   Of course, if it's not grounded in a little bit more
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:35.380]   physical reality, then it becomes a little too woo-woo.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.820]   And the way L. Ron Hubbard in Scientology
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.580]   defines survival is very much intertwined
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.940]   with how they define ethics.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.080]   Ethics, anything to be ethical is pro-survival.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.780]   To be unethical is counter-survival.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.900]   But we were talking about just the concept of the dynamics,
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.400]   like what does survival refer to?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.140]   And it actually does refer to all of them,
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.740]   but just keep in mind when it comes to the seventh dynamic,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.300]   Thetans collectively, involved in here is the idea
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.860]   that a Thetan cannot die.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.620]   There's no such thing as killing a Thetan.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.860]   A Thetan can only survive.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.140]   And so, anyway, this concept of the dynamics
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.780]   is one of the most fundamental and important concepts
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.060]   in Scientology.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.060]   But because I mentioned that it also gets tied up
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.620]   with ethics, and this probably speaks
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.520]   to what you were just talking about,
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.340]   is you can have the ideas and the concepts,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.620]   and you can have how do they go wrong,
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.620]   because they hold that Scientology, applying Scientology,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.900]   getting people into Scientology,
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.980]   is the key to basically saving
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.240]   every spiritual being in existence.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.860]   When you're analyzing what is ethical,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.940]   it becomes whatever's good for Scientology
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.080]   becomes by definition ethical,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.260]   because anything that's good for Scientology,
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.800]   which is a third dynamic, is inherently good
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.280]   for all the dynamics.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.580]   So that's where you get the ends justifying the means
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.020]   to do anything possible, use any means necessary
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.420]   to forward the aims of Scientology.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.540]   - That's kind of where a lot of Soviet implementation
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.140]   of communism went wrong, is the ends justify the means.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.500]   The equality, the justice for the workers,
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.460]   if we have to kill, murder, imprison, censor,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.820]   in the name of that, then it's for the greater good
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.100]   in the long term to achieve the ideal of communism.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.700]   - In some respects, Scientology created
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.440]   a near-perfect communist experiment in its C organization.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.180]   What is it, from everyone according to their ability
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.980]   to each according to their need or something like that?
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.220]   Scientology's C organization is damn near
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.780]   a perfect communist experiment.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.420]   Coming from someone who doesn't necessarily know
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.060]   what a perfect communist experiment really is,
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.420]   'cause I grew up in a cult, Lex.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.620]   - You can't keep using it as an excuse.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.220]   - It's a funny tagline I use in my videos.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.060]   - I like it.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.980]   - But it is interesting that an organization
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.020]   that is so hyper-capitalist and so money-hungry
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.460]   and is known to be very wealthy,
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.060]   at its core is run by this group of C org members
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.260]   that live a communist lifestyle.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.220]   - We're gonna jump around.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.500]   Let's go, what is C org?
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.420]   What is C organization?
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.260]   What is this organization?
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.780]   - The C organization is the most dedicated version,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.900]   the most dedicated brand of Scientologists.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900]   So there's three echelons of Scientologists.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.260]   There's public, who just live normal lives
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.500]   in the real world and they pay
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.780]   to do Scientology courses and auditing.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.880]   Then there's staff members, who also live in the real world,
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.060]   but work on two-and-a-half-year contracts
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   or five-year contracts at their local Scientology
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.020]   organization, and then once they finish their contract,
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.940]   their debt is paid or whatever.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.200]   And then there's the C org members.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.340]   These are the guys who sign the billion-year contracts.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.980]   They don't have lives in the outside world.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.080]   They don't own property.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.980]   They live in Scientology-provided housing.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.900]   They eat in Scientology-run cafeterias.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.380]   - Is there an actual contract that says a billion years?
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.140]   - It's symbolic, but yes.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.700]   Like, no, it's not a legally enforceable contract.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.220]   (laughing)
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.540]   They haven't succeeded in enforcing it
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.020]   in any subsequent lifetimes yet.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.740]   - Marriage contracts should be like that.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.580]   A billion years.
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.660]   'Cause not until death do us part,
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.660]   but a billion years, it really makes it very concrete
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.700]   of what you're signing up for.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.760]   - Yeah, those are the billion-year guys.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.340]   You hear a lot about the billion-year contract,
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.220]   the billion-year contract.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.420]   That's the C org.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.780]   And all of Scientology management,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.380]   international management, middle management,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.960]   continental management, and even some lower-level
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.540]   service orgs, are composed 100% of C org members.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.740]   You're not allowed to marry or date someone
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.260]   who's not in the C org.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.920]   You're also not allowed to have children.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.580]   - With anybody outside of C org or in general,
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.540]   you're not allowed to have children?
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.180]   - C org members are not allowed to have children
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.340]   unless they leave the C org.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.940]   If you're expected to have an abortion
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.500]   and stay in the C org, 'cause it's the greatest good
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.380]   for Scientology, if you accidentally get pregnant.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.600]   - Interesting, 'cause it distracts
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.880]   from the focus of the work.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.740]   - Yeah.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.320]   - What about sexual relations?
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.460]   - Only once married.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.680]   But that's why people get married after like three days.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.140]   You're like, "Hey, you, you look."
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.700]   - You look all right, let's get married.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.400]   - Are you allowed to have divorce?
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.380]   - Yeah, you get divorced a lot in the C org.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.860]   I've known people who get married and divorced
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.500]   three times by the age of 25.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.340]   - Oh, wow.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.580]   - Because in the C org, getting married
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.340]   is practically like dating.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.160]   - Right.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.640]   - Also, unless you're married, you're living in dorms
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.780]   with a bunch of other people.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.100]   So in order to get your own room,
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.660]   you also have to get married.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.460]   So there's many benefits.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.880]   - Oh, wow, okay.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.540]   So you mentioned communism.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.940]   In which way, 'cause is there a hierarchy inside C org?
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.180]   Is there a redistribution of influence,
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.080]   position, money, power inside C org?
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.900]   - Everyone in the C org makes $50 a week.
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.620]   Everybody, except David Miscavige.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.460]   - Right.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   - And some posts might have a cash bonus incentive structure,
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.240]   but fundamentally their pay is $50 a week.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.300]   So even the head of a big Scientology organization,
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.020]   is getting 50 bucks a week.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.260]   - Are celebrities also part of C org or not usually?
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.160]   So this is really the management layer.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.020]   So what's the idea behind $50 a week?
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.700]   Is that basically live a humble life?
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.100]   - They don't have to give you anything at all.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.260]   It's just, oh, you mean like,
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.980]   what's the idea behind not paying?
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.460]   - Yeah, basically not paying.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.460]   - Everything you need is already being provided for you.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.460]   You're not here for the money.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.580]   You're working all the time anyway.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.140]   It's not like you don't have days off.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.940]   I mean, you're working all the time.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.860]   There's no concept of the weekends.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.740]   There's no, oh, thank God it's Friday.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.940]   Friday is just another day.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.460]   - And how are the position, the tasks,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.660]   the jobs allocated within the C org?
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.500]   - What do you mean?
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.060]   - Like what kind of tasks you're doing?
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.620]   What kind of stuff you're doing?
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.700]   - It's very similar to just any other business,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.460]   as far as you can have your human resources,
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.100]   you can have your sales, you can have your accounting,
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.220]   your operations, your quality control.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.220]   It's just that in Scientology,
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.780]   your operations is delivering courses and auditing.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.100]   So your operations and your quality control
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.300]   where most of the activity occurs
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.220]   as far as delivering Scientology.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.020]   And then you've got your, you'd call it business development,
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.300]   but that's just bringing in new members, right?
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.620]   So the function of Scientology's organization
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.260]   is very comparable to a normal business
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.940]   in the normal world.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.820]   - So let's talk about the products of this business,
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.900]   auditing and courses.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.340]   So what's auditing?
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.580]   - So auditing is, so we described earlier,
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.260]   Dianetics auditing, Scientology auditing
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.860]   is very similar to that.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.620]   - So at first glance, it looks like psychotherapy,
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.860]   a kind of therapy.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.640]   - All Scientology auditing is going to look like that.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.120]   It's one-on-one talk therapy.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.660]   You're in a room by yourselves, no distraction, no noise.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:36.500]   - One-on-one?
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.420]   - Yeah.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.260]   - So like this?
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.660]   - Yeah, and in Scientology,
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.820]   they have what's called an E-meter.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.660]   - Right.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.100]   - Almost all auditing employs the use of an E-meter.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.620]   - What's an E-meter?
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.980]   - So an E-meter is a device that just measures
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.420]   the resistance to a small electrical flow,
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.500]   except Scientologists believe that this E-meter
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.940]   can be used to simply direct the progress
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.140]   of an auditing session, to determine whether
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:07.100]   the auditing has reached a good, satisfactory conclusion.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.460]   All auditing sessions have to end
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.660]   on a satisfactory conclusion.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.300]   Like, that's the job of the auditor.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.500]   You don't just, it's not like,
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.020]   sorry, the session sucked, see you next week.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.980]   It's not like that.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.540]   Every auditing session has to end on a positive note,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.780]   and if it doesn't, there's corrections to be made.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.700]   So the E-meter--
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.060]   - What does it look like visually?
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.300]   - Oh, you can pull it up.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.100]   Pull up mark eight, E-meter mark eight.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.980]   So there's a few dials.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.060]   - Yeah.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.740]   - There's basic information about time and duration,
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.060]   I'm presuming, and then a dial
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.100]   that just goes zero to something.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.780]   - Okay, so let's say that the meter's in front of me
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.700]   and you're the one holding the cans.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.540]   - I'm holding the cans, so you're doing the auditing of me.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.380]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.700]   I'm holding the cans.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.420]   - No, literally, in the beginning of an auditing session,
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.100]   when you're calibrating the sensitivity of the E-meter,
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.380]   you do a can squeeze.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.740]   So I go, squeeze the cans, please.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.300]   - Okay, so I'm just like squeezing the cans.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.660]   - And I'm just changing the sensitivity,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.620]   'cause when you squeeze the cans,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.140]   I wanna get about a one third of a dial drop on the needle.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.740]   The idea is, if the needle's too sensitive,
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.540]   then every time you shift around in your chair,
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.900]   the needle's gonna bounce all over the place.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.180]   So you're trying to set the sensitivity of this thing.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.980]   And that's all, the knob there on the bottom to the left,
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.900]   that's the sensitivity knob.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.820]   And that determines just how sensitive
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.020]   the needle's gonna be.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.140]   And the bigger dial is called the tone arm,
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.300]   and that is changing, I wanna say voltage or current,
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.580]   but I'm not intending, I'm gonna get
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.740]   one of those words is wrong, right?
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.140]   - But it is a real device.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.980]   - It's a real device.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.760]   - That you can actually calibrate to probably,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.820]   you know, get an outcome that you want.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.180]   - Yeah, so here's even how just how a Scientology auditor
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.280]   believes it works.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.100]   You're holding the cans, there's a tiny little battery
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.300]   in that E-meter that's sending,
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   you're completing the circuit
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.420]   when you pick up the cans, right?
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.460]   So you got a little thing going there,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.060]   and that needle will respond to your physical movement,
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.100]   but that's not what we want.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.380]   We want you to sit the hell still
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.620]   so that we can read this thing
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.860]   when I'm asking you questions, okay?
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.360]   - So you're sitting there still, very still.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.860]   - As still as you can, comfortable, right?
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.980]   And I'm gonna go, is there something
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.300]   you're withholding from me?
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.220]   And what I'm looking for is right when I say
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.860]   at the end of me, I'm looking for the needle
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.900]   to dip to the right.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.300]   - Having a needle, even if it's kind of random,
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.060]   can really be like a catalyst for conversation.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.900]   - That's what it's used for,
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.780]   except it's an enforced conversation.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.060]   So I'll give you a really good example of this.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.980]   So you're holding the cans.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.780]   Say, is there anything you're withholding from me?
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.900]   And I get an instant read.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.060]   And I go, is there anything you're withholding from me?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.660]   You're gonna go, I don't think so.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.900]   - And I don't see the needle.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.740]   - No, you don't see the needle.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.680]   I go, well, what did you think of
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.820]   when I asked you the question?
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.140]   Now, if you've already had a lot of auditing,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.100]   you know how this goes.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.300]   It means I got an instant read,
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.760]   and we're not going to move on
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.580]   until this question gets resolved.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.420]   Okay, so you're gonna go,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.860]   I don't know what I was thinking of.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.300]   And then I'm gonna be like, you know,
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.700]   take a look and I'll help you out here.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.180]   I'll try to steer you.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.060]   Okay, so I'm looking to get roughly the same read
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.020]   while you're thinking about whatever.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.340]   I'm going, what was that?
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.420]   What was that right there?
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.580]   - And you can start digging to what?
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.420]   You can start-
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.300]   - I just want an answer to the question.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.140]   Okay.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.220]   - And I can go to memory.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.180]   - Yeah, and you can give me any answer you want.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.060]   There's no way for me to know
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.340]   if you're giving me the right answer,
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.900]   but I want you to give me something.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.740]   - Yeah.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.580]   - If you say you can't give me anything,
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.580]   I'm gonna keep using the emulator
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.620]   until you give me something.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.460]   - Yeah.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.720]   - Okay, so let's say you give me something.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.860]   I'm gonna get all the details about that.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.580]   And until like time, place, form, and event,
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.420]   I wanna know everything that happened.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.460]   I wanna know all the details.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.580]   And by the way, I'm writing all this down.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.020]   So I'm taking notes of everything you're telling me
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.300]   that it's a bad thing that you did
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.980]   that you haven't told me about.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.660]   Okay, so I'm keeping notes.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.580]   When you represent to me
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.420]   that you've told me everything there is to tell,
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.660]   I'm looking for the needle
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.100]   to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.300]   And Scientology calls that a floating needle.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.580]   That means in Scientology land, we're done with that.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.200]   So now I might go back to check the question.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.320]   Okay, good, I'll check the question again.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.200]   Is there anything you're withholding from me?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.120]   Ooh, if I get another read,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.760]   we gotta go through the process again.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.520]   Okay, if you tell me I've told you everything
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.800]   and I don't get a floating needle,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   I've gotta go, okay, is there an earlier similar thing?
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.560]   Have you basically done an earlier similar thing?
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.620]   Is there an earlier similar time
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.640]   you haven't told someone something?
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.040]   Or is there an earlier similar thing
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.560]   that you did to the thing that you just told me?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.760]   We're gonna keep going earlier similar,
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.200]   earlier similar, earlier similar
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   until I get a floating needle.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.380]   And that's where, explaining it this way,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.240]   you can see how no matter what
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.360]   the specific auditing session happens to be about,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.100]   there's still the potential in any auditing session
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.260]   that you're going into past lives.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.700]   Just because you have to go earlier similar
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.060]   until you get a floating needle.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.740]   Okay, now here's how Scientologists think
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.980]   the e-meter actually works.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.900]   Meaning, why does the e-meter work?
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.180]   So we talked before about these mental pictures, right?
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.940]   These recordings, okay?
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.440]   Well, we spoke about engrams,
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.160]   just recordings of pain and unconsciousness.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.320]   Well, Scientology would hold the bad recordings
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.560]   aren't the only recordings that you have.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.740]   Those are just the recordings in your reactive mind.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.480]   You also have an analytical mind,
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.920]   which is just your conscious memory,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.740]   conscious recording of everything from present time
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.900]   to the last 76 trillion years.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.680]   And Hubbard would say that these memories
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.560]   are actually a perfectly detailed recording.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.120]   And he says like 56 perceptions or something.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.000]   And that it's perfect.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.540]   And you can access that information,
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.120]   you just have trouble doing so.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.400]   Okay, so he says that these recordings,
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.680]   these mental pictures have actual electrical charge and mass.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.400]   Now you asked before,
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.040]   is there any actual physics in this?
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.800]   I don't know, where are you supposed to store
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.820]   the pictures of your last 76 trillion years
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.840]   that have charge and mass?
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.560]   I don't see it, but Hubbard says it's there, okay.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.560]   So he says that these things have mass.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.200]   And when you recall them or put attention on them,
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.360]   you create an electrical flow,
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.920]   which maybe through magnetic fields or whatever,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   impinges upon the electrical flow of the e-meter
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.020]   and it shows up as a read on the needle.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.520]   That's how Scientologists believe
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.480]   that's why the needle reads.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.920]   Now cynics would say the needle only reads
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.600]   on palm sweat and movement.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.000]   Well I know that's not true.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.640]   I can't tell you everything the needle does read on,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.160]   but I can tell you it's not just
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.120]   moving your hands and sweaty hands.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.580]   - It does correlate to thoughts probably.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.040]   - Some way, somehow.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.400]   - 'Cause if it didn't correlate to thoughts,
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.780]   then this process would be way too inefficient.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.720]   'Cause there's going to be a bunch of people
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.160]   who are just not, you're not gonna get the,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.320]   what is it called, the floating needle.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.680]   Like no matter what.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.320]   - I can't explain to you how you get a floating needle,
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.160]   but it sure as hell isn't hand sweat
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.960]   and it sure as hell isn't squeezing the cans.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.160]   - Right, so you eventually,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.320]   most people will get to the floating needle.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.760]   And somehow-- - You get floating needles.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.600]   - There's like a feed,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.240]   there probably is a feedback mechanism
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.040]   that you're, each person realizes
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   how their mind and body,
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.240]   'cause you want a resolution, right?
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.760]   It's probably-- - You want your needle to float.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.400]   - For both people. - Yes.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.920]   - And it's probably a great experience
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.600]   when you're like, yes, it's a gamified feeling, right?
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.480]   - Well when you're training on how to use the e-meter,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.120]   there are drills where you practice
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.200]   generating with your mind various needle reactions.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.160]   So there is a drill where you sit there
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.120]   and you consciously try to create a floating needle
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.080]   by recalling happy thoughts.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.960]   You go to your happy place,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.380]   and at the end of every auditing session,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.960]   you actually have to go to a third party,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.080]   sit down in front of an e-meter
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.520]   and verify that your needle's floating.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.620]   - Nice. - Every single auditing session
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.960]   not only has to end on a floating needle,
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.160]   but then you have to go to someone else
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.920]   and have the floating needle verified.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.680]   Any Scientologist who's a seasoned recipient of auditing
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.720]   knows how to make their needle float at the examiner.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.880]   (laughing)
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.360]   - But I gotta be honest though,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.520]   this process, again, sorry to be sort of going there,
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   but it feels like this is a very
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.480]   rigorous talk therapy session.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.260]   Is there good aspects to this?
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.100]   - Sure.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.800]   A lot of people find auditing very helpful.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.200]   I mean, I've heard some describe it
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.380]   as quite thoroughly addictive.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.960]   Me personally, I never enjoyed getting auditing.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.720]   That's probably more a function of having been raised in it,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.280]   and it was never something I wanted to do.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.120]   It was something that was forced on me as a child,
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.080]   and also I was never, I don't like talking
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.120]   about private secret stuff.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.120]   You kind of have to want to be an open book
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.560]   to honestly and thoroughly participate
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.520]   in an auditing session.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   - 'Cause there's not necessarily a belief
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.940]   that this is gonna be private.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.800]   - There's no expectation of privacy,
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.120]   but there's no expectation that your stuff's
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.080]   gonna be leaked for blackmail either.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.360]   - You kind of--
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.800]   - You trust the people in the organization.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.640]   - Even despite rumors and stuff like that,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.480]   but the rumors are coming from people
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.960]   that are lying to you, essentially.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.520]   - If you're a Scientologist, and you're participating
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.880]   in an auditing session, you know that anyone
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.620]   in the organization has the ability
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.080]   to know the stuff that you talk.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.920]   It's not like, oh my God, I'm only telling my auditor
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.160]   'cause I think no one's ever gonna know.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.600]   You know that people know,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.680]   but you also trust the organization.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.240]   - How quickly does it go to past memories?
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.640]   - For people who are seasoned,
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.600]   they actually like going past life.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.560]   I hated it.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.160]   I would make sure, I was really good
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.240]   at making my needle float.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.600]   I didn't want to have some auditor,
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.040]   'cause I never believed in the past life memories.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.520]   So I didn't want to be in that impassable,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.960]   reach an impasse in an auditing session
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.800]   where I was being asked for something I couldn't provide,
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.440]   'cause I knew this auditing session
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.040]   has to end on a good point.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.360]   But Scientologists enjoy, for the most part,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.180]   they call it whole track.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.820]   Whole track is past life, going whole track.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.580]   Your time track, they call it the time track,
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.860]   is your whole memory,
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.540]   but whole track refers to anything past life.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.020]   So going whole track or deep whole track with high reality,
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.840]   meaning it's not like, oh, I have a fuzzy memory
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.260]   and I'm not sure if it's real.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.900]   Like your real seasoned Scientologists are like,
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.660]   oh yeah, I was on this planet
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.060]   and this time circling this star
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.220]   and this is what I was eating for breakfast.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.060]   - Fascinating.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.300]   Before the origin of life on Earth,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.460]   or before, so billions of years ago,
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.180]   on a distant planet where you were eating for breakfast.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.460]   - Or other universes.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.180]   - I wonder if there's a nice shortcut
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.780]   to sneak up to actual trauma that happened to you
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.260]   as a therapy device.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.500]   I just, so putting Scientology aside,
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.020]   I just am thinking about as a technique for therapy,
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.500]   discussing, basically, you know, some people have trauma
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.060]   and one of the things you do with therapy
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.620]   is like bring the trauma to the surface.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.680]   That's the stuff that happened to you in childhood.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.240]   Maybe it's a more convenient thing to do
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   to kind of map that indirectly onto a fictitious telling
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.260]   of what happened to you,
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.620]   something like that trauma on a distant planet elsewhere.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.500]   Could be a nice way to sneak up to it.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.220]   - Yeah, and it goes both flows there,
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.260]   not just things that have happened to you,
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.980]   but things that you've done.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.140]   So, you know, you could be being asked for, you know,
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.940]   you'd be going back to, I wiped out a civilization.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.220]   I committed genocide on this race on this planet.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.060]   - Oh wow.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.180]   - Oh yeah.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.880]   - So you can actually take on a whole new guilt.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.720]   - Oh yeah.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.360]   - So, okay, all right.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.920]   You might actually take on a lot more guilt than I go of.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.500]   'Cause if you feel like that self-critical aspect
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.460]   of the brain, boy, 'cause my brain is really self-critical.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.480]   So I could see myself manufacturing,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.180]   if I was forced to over time,
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.320]   some kind of story where I did genocide
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.280]   a whole population of like Pluto or something
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.980]   at a distant, somewhere in Alpha Centauri.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:33.820]   - Yeah, so I mean.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.780]   - And now I walk around with that guilt.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.700]   Wait, I'm actually a horrible person.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.340]   - So imagine though, if you had not only are you looking at,
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.180]   you know, if someone's being self-critical,
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.540]   trying to identify destructive patterns of behavior
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.740]   in your present life, but what if you really internalize
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.200]   the fact that I haven't only been this way for 40 years.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.140]   I've been this way for 40 trillion years.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.620]   - Yeah.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:59.620]   - But Scientology would argue that as a Thetan,
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.900]   you're inherently good.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.580]   All Thetans are basically good.
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.060]   So the goal of the auditing procedure there
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.700]   would be essentially to figure out, find the moment,
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.780]   find what it was that caused you to make that shift
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:17.780]   as a being to dramatize evil intentions and stuff like that.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.940]   So even if you're going whole track,
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.140]   looking at all the horrible things you've done,
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.940]   the goal is to find like,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.380]   well, what happened just prior to that?
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.020]   What was like the prior confusion?
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.140]   And what did you misunderstand just before that and whatnot?
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.780]   So the goal is basically,
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.660]   so Scientologists after a lot of auditing
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.500]   are also convinced that they have fixed the reason
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.380]   for any non-optimum conduct.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.980]   - And underlying this is a belief
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.620]   that at the core, we're all good.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.460]   - Yes.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.860]   - There's a lot of really powerful ideas in Scientology,
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.020]   which is so interesting that it goes wrong.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.500]   Okay, what about the training you mentioned,
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.780]   the training of the auditor?
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.860]   That's really interesting.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.000]   So how lengthy is that process?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.820]   - It can take years.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.980]   I mean, one of that question I wanna ask is,
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.500]   are people in Sea Org, like as an auditor,
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.060]   do you believe everything?
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:12.980]   How much, is there a crisis of faith that creeps in?
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.580]   In religion, you have a crisis of faith
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.860]   when you start to wonder like, does God even exist?
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.580]   So in this case, how often do you start to doubt
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.180]   that some of the core beliefs of Scientology are false?
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.580]   - Scientology would say that Scientology
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.700]   is not about beliefs.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.780]   It's about application of the techniques
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.220]   of Scientology auditing to improve someone's
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.900]   spiritual awareness and ability.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.740]   So the belief level of Scientology
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.100]   is pretty much the stuff we've already discussed.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.780]   - The effectiveness of the auditing process.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.920]   - So the effectiveness of the auditing process,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.120]   this is one of the things Hubbard says,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.540]   is that standard tech, Scientology, they call it the tech,
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.980]   the technology of how to deliver auditing,
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.540]   standard tech, works 100% of the time
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.260]   when applied 100% correctly.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.540]   Well, that's kind of unfalsifiable, right?
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.660]   'Cause anytime it doesn't work--
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.700]   - It wasn't applied correctly.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.040]   - Exactly.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.380]   That's a nice little escape hatch
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.660]   to pull on having a crisis of faith.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.300]   It didn't work, well, then obviously
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.620]   it wasn't applied correctly.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   That's where quality control comes in.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.380]   Their job is to nitpick, and you can always find
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.020]   one thing that wasn't done correctly.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.900]   - Communism didn't work because
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.540]   it wasn't implemented correctly.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:29.580]   It's always an escape hatch with ideologies.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.080]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.980]   I would probably argue that auditors
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.900]   are not in a position of having many crisis of faith,
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.300]   'cause actually they're usually seeing people,
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.260]   for the most part, improve in some ways
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.660]   through the process of auditing.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.700]   Now, auditing can create like a state
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.420]   of somewhat of a euphoric state.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.980]   You feel great, you're just blown out of your head.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.100]   You feel on top of the world.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.280]   I've had that in some of my auditing.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.340]   - As an auditor, sorry?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.160]   - No, as a person receiving auditing.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.020]   And so my point is, as an auditor doing a lot of auditing,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.500]   you're gonna have someone in front of you
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.660]   called the pre-clear, is the person in front of you
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.640]   who's getting the auditing, called the PC or the pre-clear.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.540]   They see over and over and over again
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.740]   these PCs having these sort of euphoric states
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.060]   and floating needles, and I feel great and fantastic.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.060]   No, thanks, you saved my life, and da-da-da-da-da.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.500]   I've always said, if people didn't find
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.420]   Scientology helpful, nobody would ever stay in Scientology.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   And so auditors are pretty much the ones
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.100]   doing the heavy lifting of what it even means
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.640]   to be a Scientologist.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.040]   Those guys aren't the ones that you end up
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.080]   having crisis of faith.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.880]   I mean, doing Scientology auditing,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.560]   it doesn't require that you just have faith
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.080]   that you believe something.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.760]   You just have to go through these motions.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.480]   And Scientologists, one of the reasons Scientologists
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.860]   think this is all scientific is 'cause it's like,
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.480]   I don't care if you believe why this works.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.040]   I care how you feel at the end of an auditing session.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.760]   - And empirically speaking, anecdotal data
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.080]   is it actually seems to improve people's lives
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.460]   within the context, so taking the outside world
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.820]   out of it, within this particular organization,
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.940]   you're actually measurably seeing improvement.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:07.780]   - Yes.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.220]   - Is that to some degree real?
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.380]   Because if you look at a book like Animal Farm,
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.860]   where the pigs start to rule the other animals,
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.820]   and over time, the life of the animals
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.980]   gets worse and worse and worse,
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:21.660]   while the pigs keep saying that it's actually
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.780]   getting better and better and better.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.540]   Again, communism, same thing.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.840]   The rationing is getting worse and worse and worse,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.760]   less and less food, but there's constant reporting
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.860]   that there's more and more food.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.260]   We're winning, hashtag.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.860]   - I would argue that what you've just described
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.180]   could be an identical description of what it feels like
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.020]   and what it means to go up,
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.440]   "Scientology's Breakthrough to Total Freedom."
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.620]   You are reinforcing to yourself that everything
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.860]   is getting better and better and better,
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.820]   and you'd be like, you don't spend time
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.500]   with your family anymore, you're broke,
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.860]   even though you make a lot of money,
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.080]   you're always stressed, you're at the beck and call
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.640]   of these people who seem to run your lives.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.920]   How a Scientologist feels about their own life is,
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.480]   it's very interesting to compare that
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.320]   to how that person's life looks
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.520]   to their non-Scientology family members.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.400]   I get contacted by a lot of people
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.600]   who've never been in Scientology,
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.760]   but they're like, "I got a family member who's really deep,
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   "and can you help me understand some things?
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.320]   "Why is this person's life like this?
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.940]   "Why is this person's life like this?"
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:29.780]   So, I don't wanna say that Scientologists
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.900]   do not actually, I don't wanna say,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.720]   "Oh, it's all in their heads,
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.520]   "they think they're being helped, but they're really not."
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.980]   That doesn't feel honest, you know?
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.680]   But it's this thing where if Scientology
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.680]   was just getting auditing when you wanted,
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.420]   about the subjects you wanted,
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.460]   and you could take it or leave it, that would be fine.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.640]   It's the fact that it's part and parcel
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.720]   to this entire organization and this entire experience
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.760]   that has, as a part of that experience,
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.400]   taking everything from you, demanding everything from you,
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.900]   controlling who you can speak with,
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.040]   controlling who you can have relationships with,
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.920]   who you have to erase from your life.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:16.200]   This is where, and it's hard to place one pinpoint on,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.080]   this is where Scientology goes wrong.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.440]   It's really hard to do that,
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.800]   because the good parts of Scientology
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.540]   and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.740]   - Yeah, so there's definition of what's bad for you,
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.240]   and it's probably in the beginning is bad for you.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.440]   This almost just sounds like a template
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.900]   of a toxic relationship.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.020]   There's a bunch of stuff in this world
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.420]   that is just not good for you,
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   so the authoritarian says, "I'm just protecting you
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.100]   "by blocking you off from those negative things."
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.680]   And they are probably negative things,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.960]   but then this freedom starts closing in
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.580]   to where you can't no longer speak freely,
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.500]   think freely, act freely.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:00.000]   And there's some, I mean, that's why power corrupts,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.940]   and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.500]   The person doing the controlling
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:08.360]   actually starts getting that dopamine rush
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.500]   of the controller that's exciting.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.620]   It's a vicious negative cycle.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.460]   So you start out, it starts out good,
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.180]   'cause you're trying to do good for the person,
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:21.860]   but then it somehow goes to shit.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.980]   So what are the aspects that are often controlled
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.620]   about a person who's in Scientology, especially Sea Org?
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.980]   - Well, information control, access to the internet,
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.700]   access to any information critical of Scientology.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.920]   - Is some internet access allowed?
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.940]   - Public Scientologists has no restrictions
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.660]   to their access to the internet.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.160]   They're just not allowed to read
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.860]   anything critical of Scientology.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.580]   - Oh, okay, so they're supposed to self-control
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.980]   what they read or not.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.200]   And what's the explanation?
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.460]   Is it always assumed that anything critical
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.740]   of Scientology is a lie?
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.700]   - They really push this thing that
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:08.660]   unless you've been in a Scientology organization yourself,
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   or unless you've actually been a Scientologist,
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.020]   you couldn't possibly know the truth about Scientology.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.580]   If you're only getting information
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.580]   from people who aren't members or former members,
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.380]   then you couldn't possibly be getting
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:20.740]   the correct information.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.900]   Now, they don't realize the math there doesn't make sense.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.140]   If you can find out the true information
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.600]   by becoming and being a Scientologist,
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.240]   then that means you can get the correct information
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.340]   from a former Scientologist,
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.420]   because they traveled that path
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.900]   and they got the correct information.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.220]   So they still create this,
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.020]   or they try to create this unfalsifiable loop,
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.820]   where unless you are personally doing it,
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.100]   you don't have correct information.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:44.940]   And you go, "Well, what about the people
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.980]   who did personally do it, got the correct information,
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.760]   left, and are now sharing that with others?"
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.740]   Well, no, those are lies.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.060]   Well, okay, so just anything you don't like is a lie then.
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:58.620]   You go, "Yeah, pretty much, that's kind of how it works."
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.940]   - So what about the control of negative information
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:01.780]   on the internet?
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.820]   What, like, the actual operations?
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.020]   I've, you know, preparing, I should admit,
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   I don't know too much about Scientology.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.620]   I was doing a bunch of reading,
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.780]   and the Wikipedia page on Scientology,
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.180]   interestingly enough, is not that negative
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.340]   about Scientology.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.700]   So, like, it made me ask,
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.000]   you have to be a little bit careful
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.580]   how you consume stuff from Wikipedia.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.540]   You have to consider, because money can buy things there,
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:28.940]   there's certain special interests and so on.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.020]   But, like, it made me wonder,
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:33.080]   like, with a lot of controversial topics,
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.180]   what is true, and where do I look,
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.300]   where do I go for truth?
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.740]   So, like, how much sort of deliberate action is there
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.100]   to control what is true on the internet by Scientology?
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.660]   - Well, these days, they've pretty much, I think,
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.940]   thrown in the towel, but--
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:46.780]   - They have.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.580]   - The Scientology middle management
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.580]   was editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.380]   that were traced back to the Scientology buildings
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.300]   that Wikipedia locked them out from any IP addresses
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.500]   associated with Scientology from being able to edit it.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.420]   It's like, the Scientology was so infatuated
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.540]   with trying to control the information,
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.700]   and in the early days of the internet,
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.780]   they had a certain degree of success with that.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.140]   It's just hopeless these days.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.380]   - The scale, the scale's not there,
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.340]   but actually, I'm very surprised how bot farms,
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.560]   how effective that can be at a very small scale.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   If you just pay 100 people to spread narratives.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.300]   But the reason that's effective
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.520]   is you can kind of create conspiracy theories
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.620]   that create chaos, and nobody knows what is true.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.260]   That bot farms can do.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.940]   But actually really nicely controlling a narrative is hard.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.980]   So to create chaos, it's easier to do.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   To basically say, do PR control is very hard.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.340]   Yeah, so especially on the internet,
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:53.180]   especially when the critical eye is there.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.940]   The internet can smell bullshit,
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.580]   which is one of the really, really powerful things
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.420]   about the internet.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.060]   And I gotta tell you, it's one of the reasons
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.660]   I do my YouTube channel.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.520]   It's one of the reasons I decided to upload every day.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.740]   I've uploaded every day for the last six months.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:09.740]   I just wanted there to be a nonstop flow of information
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.620]   of any kind and any variety,
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.980]   as long as it's fair and balanced,
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:18.380]   intelligent, interesting, that Scientologists
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.340]   who stumble upon the internet will go,
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.100]   oh look, someone's talking about my thing.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.180]   Let's see what they got going on.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.380]   And I know this guy.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.380]   The fact that Scientology crushes so much information,
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.260]   before YouTube, before,
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.120]   I have the only big Scientology channel.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.060]   And that only got big in the last six months.
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.500]   Okay, so before that, there were channels, there was things.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.740]   But it's almost like, it took a lot of,
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.080]   people felt like it took a lot of bravery and courage
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:49.020]   to say something on the internet about Scientology.
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.060]   And so people would pop up,
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.380]   and there weren't very many voices.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.300]   And I was like, I want this to be prolific.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.460]   I want to be prolific.
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.180]   I want to have 30 or 40 other channels being prolific
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:01.340]   so that Scientology couldn't possibly
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.980]   successfully control the narrative about it.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.340]   - Have you been personally attacked?
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.660]   - AaronSmith11.com is a website
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.540]   created by the Church of Scientology.
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.380]   Have you seen it?
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.420]   - No, what kind of content is on there?
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:16.100]   - Oh, Aaron's abusive father and a horrible husband
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:18.180]   and the worst staff member we've ever had.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.380]   Oh, I openly talk about it,
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.980]   because I think the fact that Scientology
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:25.780]   even does things like that is fucking hilarious.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.940]   And anything they try to do to me,
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.420]   the way I think about it is,
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.300]   you know you're just giving me an opportunity
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:33.660]   to turn the mirror back on you
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.300]   and show everyone how horrible you are.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.660]   - Does it stick?
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.500]   - No.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.700]   - So you find that there is ineffective.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.180]   - It's completely ineffective.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.020]   They're so over the top.
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:45.740]   And I'll tell you how the website even came into being.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.000]   So I was on the first season
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.740]   of Leah Remini's Scientology in the Aftermath.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.700]   Every single person who participated in that show
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.540]   got a website.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:54.900]   (laughing)
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.340]   It's just that everyone else's website is like,
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.460]   whoismarkhedley.com.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.860]   Whoismikerender.com.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.900]   Well I bought whoisarinsmithlevin.com,
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.460]   but I was too stupid to buy,
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.340]   I didn't buy arinsmithlevin.com.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.140]   So I'm actually the only one
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.300]   who has a website in their name.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.140]   - Oh, nice.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:12.980]   - Yeah.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.460]   And I'm like, I could probably get a lawyer
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.340]   to get it back for me, but I'm like, why?
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:20.380]   I want everyone to see what a nasty, petty,
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.460]   disgusting organization that this is.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.820]   And nobody believes anything Scientology says anyway.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.020]   - Does the general public know
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.100]   that it comes from Scientology?
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:27.940]   - Pull it up.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.980]   Right on the bottom, copyright 2000 whatever,
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.420]   Church of Scientology International.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.540]   Like they didn't even try to hide it.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.140]   - Arinsmithlevin.com.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:36.980]   - Yeah.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.060]   - A man with no moral compass.
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.700]   - Arinsmith, who is he really?
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.780]   Arinsmith Levin, a man with no moral compass.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.380]   Read about Arinsmith Levin,
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   an angry man spreading hate from the internet's shadows.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.620]   Open mouth shot.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.620]   And you're saying like, but wow, there's testimonies.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.180]   Oh, there's videos from former coworkers.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.740]   - The slightest thing just sets him off
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.620]   and he just goes totally nuts.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.460]   Well, that one is true.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:07.220]   I didn't understand why you slapped me before the interview.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.060]   I felt that.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.820]   - They've got links to everyone else's website
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.540]   on the bottom, it's so funny.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.060]   - Okay, the irony.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.700]   - 2021 Church of Scientology International,
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:16.840]   all rights reserved.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.500]   Here's an example of just Scientology's
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.340]   complete lack of self-awareness.
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.940]   So me and Mike Rinder, we went half season
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.580]   on like a house flip project, right?
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.100]   - Wait, Mike Rinder?
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.120]   - You know Mike Rinder.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:26.960]   - Do I?
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.780]   (laughing)
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.380]   You gave me a bobblehead of the guy.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.180]   I don't know him, I just,
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.540]   I would like to talk to him about him,
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:38.540]   but there's a very fine gentleman here with a bobblehead.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.460]   - The reason we created the bobblehead
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.300]   is because on Mike Rinder's hate site,
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.360]   Scientology created a gif or a gif.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.680]   How do you say it, what's the right way to say it?
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.060]   - The correct way is gif.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:48.900]   - Gif, good.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.860]   Scientology created a gif of Mike Rinder as a bobblehead.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.380]   It was an insult, like, oh, all he does
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.740]   is sit next to Leah Remedy and go,
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.140]   yes, Leah, yes, Leah.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.540]   And so they made a gif of him with a bobblehead.
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.740]   So we were like, we're gonna make Mike Rinder bobbleheads
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.340]   and we're gonna sell them on the spshop.com
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.900]   to raise money for the Aftermath Foundation.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.740]   - I love it.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.560]   - Yeah, and now that I--
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.260]   - So go out and buy.
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.820]   - Yeah, go to the spshop.com
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.340]   and get yourself a Mike Rinder bobblehead.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.380]   Now look, now that my profile's getting a little higher,
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.020]   this head was made to bobble.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.620]   Like this smooth, shiny head needs its own bobblehead now.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.620]   - It does, 100% does.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.860]   - I can't believe it doesn't exist.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:24.700]   So, but let me show you.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.020]   So here's what's happening here.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.620]   We just hired some day laborers off of what,
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.920]   like Craigslist or something.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.260]   So what Scientology did was they had a private investigator
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.920]   stake out the House Flip Project.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.820]   They were clearly running license plates
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.900]   of anyone who visited the property
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.340]   because otherwise how would they find out
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.500]   the laborers' names, do background checks on them
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.060]   to find out they had criminal records?
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.540]   And they published this as if it's gonna
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.420]   reflect negatively on me.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.180]   Oh, we hired someone to do work who had a criminal record?
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.980]   Who gives a shit?
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.100]   Do you know one of the biggest problems
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.580]   people with records have is finding employment.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.260]   There's nothing bad about hiring someone
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.800]   who's got a criminal record.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.700]   It doesn't reflect negatively on me,
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.980]   but it shows you what they think about those people.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.460]   It shows you what they think about people
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.020]   who are trying to put their lives back together
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.500]   and maybe actually work for a living.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.660]   And it also shows that they're surveilling us.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.700]   They don't realize that putting this up,
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   they're publishing information that they could only have
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.900]   if they're surveilling me and Mike,
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.260]   and it doesn't occur to them,
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.780]   maybe we shouldn't put that up.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.660]   - Just the general process, sad to say, of journalism
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.900]   where they're looking for any kind of dirt
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.200]   and they're trying to conjure up a story,
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.460]   and there's something about drama and negative stories
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.740]   that get clicks and so on.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.700]   So this is a general process.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.020]   The more, especially the more celebrity you become,
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.540]   the more of these kinds of attacks come,
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.260]   and they look for any kind of thing that could be,
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.740]   it doesn't even have to be facts,
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.300]   it could be just asking who is he really.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.340]   Seems to have traction on the internet.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.340]   What is the actual truth of the man you keep claiming you are
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:09.060]   of the good man you keep claiming you are?
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.500]   It's fascinating, but sometimes that can be effective.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.180]   But I think if you're being transparent and authentic
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.900]   and just putting yourself out there completely
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.980]   and your story completely,
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.320]   then that's the best way to fight it.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.240]   That's the other reason to be prolific
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.320]   on the internet, right?
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.640]   The reason Joe Rogan can't get canceled
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.240]   is because anyone can watch thousands of hours
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.500]   of the authentic Joe Rogan.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.580]   You can't misrepresent him 'cause he spent thousands
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.580]   of hours representing himself genuinely.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.460]   - Yeah, the nice thing when you're representing yourself
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.780]   genuinely, you should be a good person.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.020]   So if you're a good person, then the internet will know.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.900]   They can smell out the bullshit.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.380]   Who is David Miscavige?
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.900]   That's even like, 'cause you said L. Ron Hubbard
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.700]   founded Scientology.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:56.700]   Let's go to the story of how we transitioned
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.980]   from that to David Miscavige.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.460]   - The current leader of Scientology.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.140]   He was actually not selected by L. Ron Hubbard
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.300]   to take over, but ended up usurping power and taking over.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.180]   - This sounds like Stalin and Trotsky and communism.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.100]   Similar story.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.600]   It's the person, oftentimes in these situation,
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.220]   it's not the natural successor to power.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.700]   It's the one that takes power.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.540]   - Right.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.060]   I think the quote sometimes gets attributed
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:27.020]   to David Miscavige is, "Power is not given,
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.940]   "it is assumed."
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.700]   - Yeah. - Something like that.
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.380]   The last six years of L. Ron Hubbard's life,
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.820]   he was often a seclusion, essentially hiding from lawsuits.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.380]   Now, by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion,
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.060]   Miscavige had sort of already risen up
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.980]   through the ranks of the C organization.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.500]   Now, Miscavige was like a teenager,
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.820]   either like 11, 12, 13, something like that.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.740]   Miscavige was not born into Scientology,
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.300]   but he was a young boy when his father
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.540]   got into Scientology.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.500]   Miscavige did start working as a C org member.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.600]   There's one organization that existed
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.140]   to essentially serve Hubbard directly
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.260]   and to represent his interests,
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.340]   and that was called the Commodore.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.180]   He was the Commodore of the C organization.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.660]   The Commodore's Messenger's organization,
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.240]   we're gonna call it the CMO.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.780]   Miscavige started working for the CMO
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.900]   pretty early on in his C org career,
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:17.060]   by the way, as did Mike Rinder, Mini Mike.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.020]   And so he just became known as a doer,
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.880]   like a guy who'll get it done.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.300]   No excuses, no stops, get it done.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.900]   So he had made a name for himself in the CMO
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.020]   around the time, by the time Hubbard
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.620]   went off into seclusion.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.700]   Now, when he went off into seclusion,
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.540]   he took two other CMO, or I'm gonna call them messengers,
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.460]   Commodore's Messengers.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.620]   He took two other messengers with him, Pat and Annie Broker.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.820]   Now, it has been said by people,
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.420]   Mike, Mike Rinder has told me, he goes,
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.540]   "The reason Pat and Annie went off with LRH
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.940]   "isn't necessarily because he desperately wanted them to,
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.620]   "but partly because we could afford to let them go.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.460]   "We didn't necessarily need them."
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.660]   - Sure. - Okay.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.660]   And between the two of them,
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:06.220]   Annie was the one who was like a really compassionate person,
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.700]   intelligent person, caring person.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.980]   - Was there a possible trajectory of this world
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.580]   where she was the one that took over?
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.420]   - Yes.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.060]   In fact, Pat and Annie Broker were the two people
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.820]   that were supposed to take over.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.260]   Okay, but because Pat and Annie
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.500]   were with Hubbard in seclusion,
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:28.500]   Miscavige basically had the complete run of the operation
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.340]   without any oversight from Hubbard.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.440]   The only way any information would get
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.340]   from Scientology World to Hubbard
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.860]   is Miscavige and Pat Broker
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.380]   would meet at a confidential location
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.660]   and Miscavige would give Broker
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.780]   any information he wanted to go to LRH.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.060]   So if Miscavige wanted to get rid of somebody,
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.220]   all he had to do was feed LRH false information
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:52.660]   that this person had been caught doing something treasonous.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.900]   And then he would get in response
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.140]   some order from L. Ron Hubbard to get rid of this person.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:00.700]   So are there so many similarities
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:04.740]   between various communist regimes and fascist regimes?
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.020]   - Well, Hitler did the same thing
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.020]   when he became the Supreme Leader.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.560]   He had to take power.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.060]   Yeah, he had to wait for the president to die,
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.740]   but the whole time there's a control of information
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.060]   and a slow aggregation of power.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.700]   Of course, with nations it's different
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.240]   'cause if you control the military, you control a lot.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.100]   So you have to also get the generals on your side and so on.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.500]   But I'm sure in this situation
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.260]   there is similar kind of dynamics.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.940]   You have to get certain people on your side,
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.380]   control the flow of information,
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:37.100]   let the original founder, the original leader die off,
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.660]   and make sure that you are the one
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.740]   that's left with the power.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:40.860]   - Right.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.820]   So whereas Pat and Annie are off with LRH,
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.460]   all of Scientology's attorneys and accountants
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.560]   and lobbyists and whatever, they all know Dave.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.380]   Dave's the one they deal with.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.420]   So LRH passes away, Pat and Annie make this appearance.
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:57.920]   Nobody knows Pat and Annie.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.080]   Everybody knows Dave.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:03.260]   And so he ended up getting rid of Pat and Annie.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.380]   This is a very short,
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.840]   perhaps slightly bastardized version of it,
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.500]   of Miscavige basically.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   They had been ushering just suitcases of cash
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.740]   to L. Ron Hubbard during this time.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.100]   And so you have Miscavige handing boatloads of cash
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.760]   to Pat Broker.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.820]   Pat would do crazy things like hide the money
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.540]   in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.380]   So Miscavige basically threatened to turn Pat Broker
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.700]   over to the IRS for tax evasion.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.740]   Pat Broker's still alive.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.100]   - Is he a Scientologist or not?
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.340]   - No, he basically went away and kept his mouth shut.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.900]   She died a handful of years ago.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:46.860]   She stayed a loyal Sea Org member until the very end.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.140]   But literally, Miscavige put her on menial tasks.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.920]   Like she had no authority whatsoever.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.340]   She was just put on menial tasks,
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.300]   washing dishes, but not really, groundskeeper.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.580]   Just stupid low-level assistant, paper pusher stuff.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.620]   She never operated with any actual authority,
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:06.600]   even though she was supposed to be the one
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.560]   to take over her and Pat.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.140]   - So on David Miscavige, difficult question,
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.780]   but can you make both the case that he is a good man
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.680]   who's misunderstood and the case that he's not a good man?
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.220]   - First of all, I believe that Miscavige
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.580]   is a true believer in Scientology.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.420]   I do believe that.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.900]   - That's a really important question.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.260]   Do you think he believes in all the thetans and all of that?
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.220]   - He definitely believes in that.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.300]   I think he believes in Scientology,
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.720]   but in a different way than all other Scientologists
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.160]   because he's aware of a lot more information,
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.560]   damaging information about L. Ron Hubbard
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.440]   and the true story of Scientology than most people.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.660]   So his version of belief is different.
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.040]   I'll give you one example here.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.760]   So Scientology's bridge to total freedom
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.680]   goes up to what they call OT8, Operating Thetan Level Eight.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.020]   Scientologists have all been told
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.280]   that L. Ron Hubbard, before he passed,
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.640]   finished, completed, putting together OT9, 10, 11, 12,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.840]   13, 14, and 15.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.580]   It's just sitting in the vault, waiting to be released.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.260]   This is part of the Scientology belief system
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.340]   because remember I said going up Scientology's bridge
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.740]   to total freedom is how you're supposed to get back
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.820]   to your native godlike state.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.220]   Well, all the Scientologists in the world
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.980]   who've already done OT8 know that they haven't gotten there,
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.300]   but they still believe in Scientology
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.340]   because they're told there's more.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.060]   But wait, there's more.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.660]   Miscavige knows there is no more.
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.100]   So Miscavige knows the fundamental promise
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.100]   of being able to achieve full Operating Thetan is a lie.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.920]   He knows L. Ron Hubbard didn't accomplish that,
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.060]   so therefore no one else is going to accomplish it as well.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.740]   If L. Ron Hubbard had accomplished it,
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.580]   Miscavige knows, well, he didn't write it up,
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.380]   he didn't leave instructions
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   for how anyone else would accomplish it.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.740]   So no matter what, Miscavige knows
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.820]   that the fundamental promise,
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.380]   that what Scientology is saying,
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:02.380]   they will be able to deliver to mankind is a lie.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.580]   Now it's gonna sound like I'm contradicting myself
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.400]   'cause it sounds like I'm saying,
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.820]   well, he knows it's bullshit.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.900]   I think he believes that L. Ron Hubbard just failed
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:16.860]   to finish his work, and he's kind of hoping
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.100]   L. Ron Hubbard's gonna come back to finish the job.
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.740]   'Cause L. Ron Hubbard did tell the people
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.820]   at the International Management Base,
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.180]   at least a core of them, that he was coming back.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.980]   Now we know that David Miscavige believed this
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.780]   because right around the 21 year mark,
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.140]   he was supposed to come back like 21 years after he died.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.900]   Right around the 21 year mark,
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.420]   David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.180]   in place that had to get done
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.380]   in case L. Ron Hubbard came back.
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:43.980]   So we know he at least believed to that level.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.180]   - Do you believe that L. Ron Hubbard
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.060]   can sort of enter his own body?
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.460]   - No, that's not how it works in Scientology.
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:55.780]   - Okay, so you can't have a transfer of thetans.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.980]   If you were full OT, you could.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.700]   - Can you describe the OT again?
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.220]   So OT levels, OT one, two, three, four, five to the eight.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.100]   What are they?
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.500]   How do you get to level one?
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.340]   - I'm gonna answer this question
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.420]   by first connecting some dots.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:09.300]   - Yes. - Okay.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.700]   We spoke earlier in the interview
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.740]   about achieving your native god-like state.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:18.380]   That in Scientology is called native state.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:22.380]   Okay, native state and full operating thetan
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.180]   mean the exact same thing.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.820]   Okay, because at native state,
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.380]   you are a fully operating thetan.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.140]   You know, operating meaning operating in your full capacity.
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:35.180]   So OT means operating thetan.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.540]   So the upper confidential half of Scientology's bridge
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:40.100]   are called the OT levels, the operating thetan levels.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.460]   And these, and remember, they're confidential.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.380]   So most Scientologists have not done these levels.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.060]   They don't know what's on them.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.780]   It is on these levels that you learn
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.900]   about the Zinu in the body thetan story.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.460]   - Can you describe Zinu please?
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.020]   - We spoke earlier about how at the lower
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.020]   non-confidential levels of Scientology's bridge,
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.060]   Hubbard is saying that what's wrong with you
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.220]   is your reactive mind.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.140]   - Yes. - Okay.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.420]   Well, in Scientology,
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.320]   once you've gotten rid of your reactive mind,
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.260]   that is what's called the state of clear.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.100]   Okay, so after you finish state of clear,
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.540]   the next thing on the bridge is the OT levels.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.260]   Well, if you've already gotten rid of your active mind,
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.700]   what the heck are you supposed to do now?
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.540]   Well, now L. Ron Hubbard says,
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.060]   okay, first, what was wrong with you
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.020]   was just your reactive mind.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.120]   But now the next thing you have to resolve,
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.600]   the next thing that's wrong with you
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.120]   is you actually have tens of thousands of thetans
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.620]   stuck to your body,
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:33.380]   and they all have their own reactive minds.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.220]   - Oh, wow.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.260]   - You have to audit the thetans.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.940]   - How do you audit the thetans?
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:45.280]   Are these like different shades of your inner mind,
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.900]   and you just have to try to access them somehow?
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.180]   - You use the E-meter, just like we spoke about,
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:53.120]   except now you've got a divider that separates the cans
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.060]   so they don't short circuit,
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.540]   and you hold both cans in one hand,
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.940]   and you have the E-meter in front of you,
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:00.380]   so now you're auditing yourself.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.700]   You're telepathically talking to the thetans
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.260]   that are stuck to you.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.340]   You are thinking the commands
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.300]   instead of saying them out loud,
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.100]   and you sort of do drills where you practice
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.060]   looking for E-meter reads at the instant you have a thought.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:19.380]   You're telepathically auditing spirits
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:22.140]   that L. Ron Hubbard says are stuck to your body.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.780]   Does this sound like a recipe for a mental breakdown?
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.420]   - Or a heck of a mental journey.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.980]   Wherever that leads, it could lead anywhere.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.700]   It'd probably lead to a very bad place, right?
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.920]   - Very often does.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.480]   And you combine that with the fact that Scientology
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.820]   is against any forms of mental health
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.580]   outside of Scientology, and you have a recipe for disaster.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.500]   Now, you might go, where did all these spirits come from
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.860]   that are stuck to your body?
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.780]   This is where Xenu comes into play.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.580]   So Hubbard says that 75 million years ago,
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.580]   Xenu was basically a dictator.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.980]   The Galactic Confederation is like 70-something
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.460]   or 80-something planets somewhere in the Milky Way,
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.860]   and Xenu was like a dictator, an overlord
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.300]   for either one of these planets or the whole system,
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.780]   and they had a population problem.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.820]   And Xenu was like, we need to get rid of half the people.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.740]   So we called them all in for tax audits.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.020]   L. Ron Hubbard didn't like the IRS,
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.380]   so of course the story has to do with tax audits.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.700]   Called them all in for tax audits, said, "Psych, bitches!"
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.900]   Froze them in glycol, loaded them up on space planes,
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.500]   flew them to Earth.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.820]   Remember, the story has to be Earth
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.220]   because the story is "What's Wrong With Us?"
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.060]   Flew them to Earth, dropped them in volcanoes,
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:38.500]   blew them up with hydrogen bombs,
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.380]   and then captured them with spirit magnets.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.080]   I'm making up words 'cause, okay.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.820]   And these disembodied spirits of these people
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.580]   that got blown up have just been blown in the wind
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.060]   here on Earth, and they attach themselves to things,
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.420]   and they can be in the environment,
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.260]   and they stick to bodies and everything.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.820]   And they all have reactive minds.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.640]   So at Scientology's upper levels,
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.780]   if you get sick or you have cancer
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.420]   or there's something wrong with you,
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.540]   Scientology will say, "That's one of your body things.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.420]   "You need to get some auditing to fix the body things."
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.980]   - So this story, you do it with a kind of
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.420]   a bit of a chuckle, but when done seriously,
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.020]   so it's just told in a serious way,
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.460]   or written down, and you read it.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.460]   - By most accounts, Scientologists struggle
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:26.700]   when they read this for the first time
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.860]   because this is not consistent with what
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.540]   Scientologists are hoping for is on the OT levels.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.160]   They're hoping for some real life-changing magic.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.900]   The way these things are described and sold,
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.020]   remember, they're hoping that these OT levels
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.380]   are gonna give them the ability to go
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:45.300]   completely independent of their body at will.
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.380]   Exteriorize from your body, go back into your body.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.220]   Have some real spirit powers.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.660]   - So first it's kind of a shock.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.780]   But then you still probably believe, you hope.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.740]   And you might turn on yourself, self-critical,
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.560]   that this is, I'm just not strong enough yet.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.180]   - Yeah, 'cause also part of Scientology,
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.020]   remember, it works 100% of the time
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.100]   when used 100% correctly.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:11.220]   And if it doesn't, it could be because
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.340]   something's not being done right.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.260]   But it also could be because you're doing bad things
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.060]   that you're not telling people about.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.580]   Like if you're committing present time
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.460]   overts, crimes, sins, Scientologists would be like,
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:26.180]   that's part of the reason auditing isn't working on you
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.180]   is because you're committing criminal behavior
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.700]   that you're not being honest about.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.740]   So every Scientologist is sort of incentivized
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:36.740]   to make auditing work on them, okay?
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.740]   Now Lex, this work is a little crazy.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.580]   On OT-3, you learn about the OT,
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.900]   the body things for the first time.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.940]   When you finish OT-3, you attest to having achieved
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.180]   the state of having no more body things.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.060]   And then you start OT-4, and he's like,
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:54.680]   psych, you got more, you got more BTs,
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.340]   except those other BTs, they had drug problems
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.060]   and that's why you couldn't find them the first time.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.780]   So we're gonna do something a little different here,
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.020]   do something a little different there.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.920]   Gotta get rid of these BTs that were addicted to drugs, okay?
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.940]   Then you finish OT-4 and you're thinking,
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.940]   man, I hope we get to the good stuff soon.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.420]   And then you get to OT-5 and he's like,
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.820]   psych, you got more BTs.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.020]   You couldn't find these BTs
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.620]   'cause they were all bunched up together in clusters
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.060]   and first you have to break up the clusters
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.460]   and then you can get rid of the BTs.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.740]   And you're like, okay, gotta do that.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:25.420]   - And this was all L. Ron Hubbard approved.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.060]   - Yeah, this is from L. Ron Hubbard.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.340]   And then after you finish OT-5,
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.100]   you get rid of all the BT clusters.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.500]   OT-6 is just a training course to teach you how to audit OT-7.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.220]   Well, OT-7 is now more BTs,
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.380]   except it's in the environment and stuff.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.580]   You're trying to locate BTs, you can find them on your body,
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.500]   but it's just more BTs.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.660]   Okay, and then OT-8 is, remember we talked about
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:47.940]   in all these auditing sessions
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.340]   throughout the entire Scientology bridge.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.060]   You have people who've run hundreds or thousands
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.580]   of past life whole track incidents.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.180]   These memories have become part of their self-identity
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.420]   of who they even think they are.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.380]   OT-8, you go through all these past life recalls
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.780]   and essentially, I'm oversimplifying this a little bit.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:10.340]   He goes, "Psych, all those past life memories weren't yours.
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.940]   "They were your BTs."
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:16.820]   And he goes, "Now that you've discovered this,
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.120]   "now you know who you are not
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.380]   "and you are ready to find out who you really are."
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.420]   Well, now you're supposed to find out
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.780]   who you really are on OT-9 and 10.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.140]   Those don't exist.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.420]   - Do we know they don't exist?
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.260]   - Yes.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.140]   In fact, the whole story of how that became known
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.180]   is part of how David Miscavige was able
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.740]   to get rid of Pat Broker and take over power
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:42.820]   because it was believed that Pat Broker
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.620]   was in possession of the upper unreleased OT levels.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.580]   And when Miscavige determined that he was not
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:51.380]   and there weren't in fact any levels,
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.420]   that was a bad day to be David Miscavige
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.300]   'cause he now knew he had something on his hands
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.620]   he could not get himself out of.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:57.460]   He's like, "Oh."
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.820]   - So there's no gap for faith to seep in
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.020]   that there is a level nine and 10, 11, and 12?
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.740]   - Oh, the faith is there.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.100]   Scientologists believe that these things do exist.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.420]   - Yeah.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.020]   - L. Ron Hubbard didn't leave anything behind.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.380]   - Does David Miscavige believe they exist?
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.740]   - Oh no, he knows they don't exist.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.100]   - No, but-- - When I say exist,
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.340]   oh, I don't mean do advanced levels
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.440]   of spiritual awareness exist.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.980]   When I said it, it means did L. Ron Hubbard
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:29.620]   write down what anyone is supposed to do
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.100]   that's called OT nine?
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:31.940]   That doesn't exist.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.580]   - So you're saying David Miscavige believes
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:37.660]   that they can be written down so they exist
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.420]   sort of in a platonic sense and L. Ron Hubbard
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.300]   is the only one that can write it down?
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.220]   - Yes. - So his faith
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.340]   is really deep.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:47.700]   - Oh, you mean his faith that only L. Ron Hubbard
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.740]   could have ever been the one to do it?
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.380]   - Yes. - The full principles,
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.820]   beliefs of Scientology, he is,
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.620]   are you sure he believes?
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.180]   - That what exactly?
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.220]   - Everything about Scientology that is true.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:03.100]   - To the best of my ability to know that,
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.440]   I believe it to be true.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.180]   Like I'll give you some all even stupid examples.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.740]   Like Mike Renders told a story
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.060]   where at the International Base,
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:15.100]   Miscavige actually had like a copper contraption
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.960]   built into the ground, like grounded into the ground
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.180]   to come out where you could hold it
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.060]   and he had something he sort of came up with to,
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.620]   your BT, it could ground your BTs.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.140]   Could get your BTs that if you were feeling
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.740]   overstimulated or something.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.140]   I'm probably slightly bastardizing this story.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.380]   But he came up with this as a great idea,
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   something to help someone de-stimulate
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.340]   if their BTs were getting a little too overactive.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.140]   Now, so that's a stupid story that's sort of like,
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:43.020]   well, it shows you he believes in the concept of BTs
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.700]   if he's creating little rods to get rid of them,
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.940]   to ground them into the earth.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.620]   - Well, he could be conjuring up the stories
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.540]   because he understands the power of myth and narrative
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.140]   and so on to inspire.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:53.980]   - Sure.
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.700]   - But like, but also if we look at history,
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.820]   both with, this is an interesting thing
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.700]   because I've been reading a lot about Hitler and Stalin
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:06.020]   and it seems like both of them in different ways
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:10.180]   believed in the stories they were telling.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.220]   Even when the stories, this is the fascinating,
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.260]   especially with Hitler and propaganda,
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.040]   where they were literally conjured up at first.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.820]   But then you start to believe you're in propaganda.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:22.940]   With Stalin, I think what he always believed
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:25.900]   is the bigger ideal of pure communism
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:29.380]   and anything justifies the journey to communism
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:32.780]   because it will ultimately be good for humanity
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.060]   to achieve the state of pure communism.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:40.060]   And then he's a godlike figure that can bring humanity there.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.900]   But like, with Hitler, it's interesting
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.940]   because there's constant propaganda
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.580]   that he knows is not true.
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.900]   A little bit, there's gotta be doubt,
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.460]   but then he like, all doubt is removed very quickly.
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.580]   - Yeah.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.900]   I guess humans are just, this is how they operate.
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.740]   - Yeah.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.020]   The conversation about David Miscavige
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.500]   gets really interesting because I could give you a,
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.100]   if I wanted to make the argument that he didn't believe,
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:07.060]   I could give you a dozen examples to make that argument.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:12.060]   I just happen to think that he believes in a different way,
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.340]   whereas your average Scientologist
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.260]   believes that Alvaron Hubbard was practically infallible,
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.020]   that he thought of everything in advance,
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.580]   he took care of everything before he left,
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.100]   and Miscavige still believes in like,
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.060]   the main structure of this thing,
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.820]   but he's like, "Oh shit, it's falling to me
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.340]   "to figure out how to actually make this thing happen."
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.460]   I think Miscavige sees himself as someone
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.140]   who has to a certain degree had to go back
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.100]   and fix Alvaron Hubbard's mistakes.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:42.460]   - Do you think he sees himself as doing good for the world?
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:43.540]   - I do.
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.700]   - What about for the people of Scientology?
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:48.740]   - I think in his own way, he does.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.100]   I don't think he wakes up thinking
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:54.300]   he's screwing Scientologists.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.460]   I think he sees everyone else as screwing him.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.460]   I think he sees that it is his job to expand Scientology
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:05.340]   throughout the world and accomplish the aims of Scientology,
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.500]   and he sees that it's not happening,
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.340]   and he thinks if everyone else would just stop,
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:11.740]   if everyone else would get out of his way
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.180]   and stop creating problems for him, it would happen.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:20.000]   I do think he sees himself as someone who is doing good.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.160]   I think that's fair to say.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.800]   I think the evidence shows that.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.560]   - What about the effects of clearly power and influence
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.080]   that he's had and money?
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.320]   - Yeah, without question,
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.280]   that has served as a corrupting force.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.040]   - It has. - Without question.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.480]   - Have you seen sort of evidence of that,
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.920]   that he's changed over time?
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   - After the 1993 IRS exemption that Scientology won back,
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.520]   and this information comes from Mike Rinder,
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.240]   that's when David Miscavige,
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.760]   as soon as the checks on his power were removed,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.120]   Miscavige's behavior changed markedly.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.120]   - Can you tell the story of Shelley Miscavige
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.520]   and the mystery surrounding her?
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.440]   I saw that there is quite a bit of mystery.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:04.320]   - Yeah, so Shelley Miscavige, for many years,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.480]   held the job of her post in the C organization
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.440]   was David Miscavige's assistant.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.840]   That was her post.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.720]   It's important to truly understand that and what that means
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   because the fact that she was Miscavige's wife
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.040]   is meaningless, and this is something that's hard
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.080]   for regular people in the regular world
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.760]   to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.440]   For C-org members who are spouses, it means nothing.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.920]   - Your role matters more within C-org.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.800]   - Your role's the only thing that matters.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.480]   So let's say if Shelley was married to Dave,
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.680]   but she worked in a different organization.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.440]   She would never be seen with him ever, publicly ever.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.520]   Wouldn't travel with him,
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.240]   wouldn't go to events with him, nothing.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.280]   Sometime around 2006, 2007,
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.160]   and I'm very oversimplifying this, okay?
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.880]   Shelley basically pissed off Dave to the point
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.760]   where he's like, "Okay, I'm done with you.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.240]   "I'm gonna take you off of your post."
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.520]   Okay?
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.180]   At that point, she was reassigned
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.980]   to another confidential Scientology base
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.660]   up in Twin Peaks, California.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:16.920]   Why am I, the reason I'm providing this type of detail
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.720]   is because we hear that Shelley's missing.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.560]   - Yeah.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.640]   - Okay, well, you realize the same people
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.720]   who report that Shelley's missing
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.600]   are also the same people
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.800]   who will tell you exactly where she is.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.160]   Okay, she works at this secretive CST,
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.680]   Church of Spiritual Technology base
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.720]   out in Twin Peaks, California.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.000]   I have personal confirmation that she was seen
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.160]   and spoken with by someone who knew her well in,
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.940]   I'll say 2019.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:47.080]   Shelley Miscavige is missing in the sense that
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:52.200]   she hasn't been seen with David Miscavige since about 2006.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.460]   But because she's no longer his assistant,
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:57.680]   you would never see her with him.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.080]   - As opposed to like the mystery of a person
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.340]   that might be murdered,
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:05.760]   this is more of a reallocation within the organization.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.020]   - Certain people who cover Scientology,
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.220]   who have published stories
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:15.460]   where Shelley's Miscavige's family member
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.260]   told a story to another family member,
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.460]   who told the story to a friend,
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.300]   who told the story to a former Scientologist,
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.580]   who told the story to a journalist,
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.780]   who published the story,
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:25.900]   has created the impression
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.700]   that some of Shelley Miscavige's family members
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.540]   are actually talking to the press,
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.940]   when in fact that has never occurred.
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.060]   And so the very people who are publishing
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.620]   about Shelley Miscavige missing
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.420]   have contributed to the fact that Shelley Miscavige
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.200]   does no longer speak to those family members
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.280]   because she thinks they're talking to the press
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.760]   when they never have.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.880]   It's pretty messed up.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.040]   - It's sad that she,
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.080]   'cause those family members would be a way for her
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.080]   to recover, to flourish as a human being, to escape.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.320]   - Yeah.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.200]   So I believe the information that I have,
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.120]   that I verified,
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.680]   I'm the one representing it's true
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.720]   without revealing my sources.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.140]   That Shelley was still actively in touch regularly
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.380]   with family members outside of the C organization
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.160]   since about, until about 2014.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.980]   So I mean regularly.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.860]   Okay, so there's no question about her safety
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:18.780]   during that period.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.180]   And then someone else who knew Shelley very well
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:25.240]   did see her and actually have a conversation with her
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.740]   in a public place in 2019 or 2020.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.940]   Now somebody could still come along and be like,
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:31.860]   "How do we know she's okay?
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:32.740]   "It's been three years."
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.380]   Yeah, okay, you can say that about anybody.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.040]   You know, the nature of working
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.520]   in the highest levels of Scientology management
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.880]   at these super secretive bases,
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.040]   it's a very weird and unique situation.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.800]   It has isolation baked in.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800]   - How is secrecy enforced?
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.800]   Why is everybody holding on to their stories so intensely?
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.880]   People that are within the organization.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.720]   Like it's hard to leak information.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.680]   - Oh, they wouldn't wanna leak.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:01.760]   They're true believers.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.620]   They see, like there's sort of a conspiracy theory
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.660]   that runs right through all of Scientology,
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:12.100]   which is that Scientology represents
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.940]   like an existential threat to the powers
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.180]   that really control this planet.
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:20.820]   - Do they have a face to the powers that really control?
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.620]   Do they have names to it?
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:23.620]   Like who's controlling?
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:24.980]   - It's Zeno's homies.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.580]   - Well, I'm sure that's not what they say.
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.740]   Zeno embodied in--
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.640]   - It's actually sort of a multifaceted conspiracy
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.400]   in that on the one hand, L. Ron Hubbard points his fingers
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.200]   at like the international bankers,
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.800]   which has shades of antisemitism to it.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.520]   - And then the IRS is going to be quickly baked in or no?
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.960]   - The IRS, no, the IRS is so low on the totem pole
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.800]   as far as the, I mean, the international bankers,
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.040]   he would say runs everything.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:51.860]   - Got it.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.120]   - But use that these bankers also use big pharma
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.460]   and big psych to control the population.
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:04.400]   And Scientology is famously against pharma and psych.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.820]   And so this is sort of how L. Ron Hubbard characterizes
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.260]   like this big war between Scientology
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.180]   that's trying to set everyone free
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.560]   and big pharma and big psych
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.660]   that's trying to enslave everyone on the planet.
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.820]   - Yeah, controlling their mind,
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.940]   controlling their body through chemicals and--
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:22.380]   - And who controls the press, big pharma and big psych.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:24.460]   - So there's a lot of correlation
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.980]   to other kinds of conspiracy theories.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.820]   - Yeah.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.300]   - Oh, that's fascinating.
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.060]   - But you asked the question
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:34.740]   where why would all these people hold onto their stories?
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.060]   They don't, they would never wanna leak.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.620]   Like by even anyone who would wanna leak
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.900]   would not even wanna be a Scientologist anymore.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.780]   Like if you truly believe,
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.500]   if you truly believe in Scientology
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.580]   and you got your shoulder to the wheel
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.980]   and you're a C-ORG member,
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.200]   you think Scientology is literally the only thing
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.660]   that can save every being on this planet
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:58.700]   from a fate of eternal amnesia and slavery.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.580]   - Yeah.
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:00.420]   - Right?
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.740]   And so it's like, I mean, you've seen the Matrix, right?
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.020]   So you've got everyone,
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.860]   once you're unplugged from the Matrix
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.420]   and you realize, yeah, you can get plugged back in
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:11.420]   and live your nice life, but you're a slave.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.420]   That's how Scientologists see this planet.
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.940]   They actually, they refer to Earth as a prison planet.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.660]   - Just at an individual level,
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.020]   how is it possible to reach a person like that?
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:24.500]   Is there something you could say to that?
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.980]   Like what's the journey of reaching a person like that?
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:32.980]   - I personally, because when I was in those shoes,
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.020]   I say there's nothing anybody could have said to me
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:39.940]   to get me to change how I felt and thought about Scientology.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.140]   It's almost foolproof that the more evidence
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:47.060]   you try to present that there's something wrong
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.940]   with what Scientology is doing,
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.180]   the more you're just working for the psychs.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.500]   It's very, very difficult.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.620]   I mean, most people who leave Scientology
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:00.340]   leave because they have had some personal experience
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.260]   that was just such a grave injustice
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:07.380]   that it just pushed them beyond the point
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.180]   of what they were willing to experience.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:11.340]   Very rare, I'm not sure I've really ever heard a story
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.380]   of someone going, yeah, I just woke up,
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.260]   I just gradually realized it was all BS and drifted away.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:21.220]   It's usually like, no, I really believed
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.700]   and they treated me so horribly,
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:28.180]   I almost had no choice but to leave.
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:30.420]   And then the stories get pretty crazy.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:32.140]   - Meaning you don't care what's true anymore,
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:35.020]   you just have to leave with the unpleasant feeling,
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:35.860]   the suffering.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:39.580]   - Yeah, and this sort of goes back to the conversation
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.780]   we're having about like, well, does Miscavige really believe?
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:44.140]   And I said I could make an argument
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.980]   for the fact that he doesn't, right?
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:49.220]   Because I go, it wouldn't be that hard
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.660]   to change the way Scientology treats people
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:56.220]   just a little bit and you'd probably stop losing anyone
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.100]   because Scientologists already believe
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.900]   to such a strong degree, you have to be pretty
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:03.020]   fricking horrible to people to make them leave.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:05.180]   And that's where you go, well, does Miscavige
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:07.260]   even want Scientology to expand?
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.820]   'Cause if he was really being clever about it,
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.980]   it seems like he could at least stop the bleeding
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.380]   and yet he doesn't.
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.540]   So that's where you make the argument,
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.740]   well, if he doesn't, then he must not want to.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.660]   - So his mind is corrupted to the point
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:20.100]   where he's not able to actually be
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.740]   a good businessman essentially.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:22.740]   - It seems that way.
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:28.220]   The numbers of Scientologists have been going down
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:29.940]   and down and down since the early '90s.
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:32.100]   - Is there a good, I mean, it's very difficult
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.940]   to get to this number, but is there a good estimate
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.340]   of what the current number of Scientologists,
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.060]   of practicing Scientologists is?
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.540]   - Oh yeah, I did a video about this.
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:42.260]   It's actually quite easy to get to the number.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.860]   It's not more than 35,000 in the entire world.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.980]   And that's being very generous and charitable.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.660]   I was intentionally generous.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.180]   I broke it all down in a spreadsheet and everything.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.620]   - Can you give some insights of how you get that info?
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.860]   - Sure, there's about 175 to 200 Scientology organizations
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.140]   in the world.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.260]   Anybody who's ever worked at these organizations know
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:04.720]   there's not more than 35 to 50 staff members per org.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.620]   There's not more than one to 200
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.900]   public Scientologists per org.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.700]   I broke down the number of SEERG members
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.940]   who'd be working at every continental management unit,
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.300]   middle management, international management.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.640]   I broke it on the mission network.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:18.300]   And I was generous.
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.020]   I mean, my numbers were like, if L. Ron Hubbard came back
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.180]   and they were doing an event,
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:27.740]   L. Ron Hubbard was coming back and announcing OT nine and 10
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.700]   how many Scientologists could we scrape together
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.620]   in every city to come to this event?
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.300]   It wasn't more than 35,000.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.460]   Now contrast that to what Scientology says.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:40.460]   Millions, 10 million people.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.620]   - Is this less people than there used to be?
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:46.060]   - Yeah, at its peak it was about 100,000 active members.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.600]   - But never the millions.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.660]   - Never, no.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:54.440]   - Has David Miscavige used violence?
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.820]   Has there, in your understanding of it,
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:00.720]   in your estimation, sort of harassment, assault,
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.180]   and actual, I don't know how to define assault, but violence?
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:08.280]   - Oh yeah, dozens of former SEERG members
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.400]   from the international base have told stories
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.700]   of being assaulted by Miscavige.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.000]   In fact, Mike Rinder is probably the one person
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.220]   who's been assaulted by Miscavige more than anyone else.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.020]   He's personally probably been assaulted dozens of times.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.820]   - Who is Mike Rinder?
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:26.460]   - So Mike Rinder, one of the highest ranking executives
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.620]   in Scientology.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:28.860]   - The author.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.660]   - There you go, a billion years.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.300]   - Of a billion years.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.180]   - It really is a fantastic book.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.200]   'Cause Lex, the guy was born and raised in Scientology
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.780]   and worked personally with L. Ron Hubbard
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.340]   and worked personally with David Miscavige for decades.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.340]   Doesn't get much more insider than that.
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:46.100]   A candid and deeply felt memoir of a life lost
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:49.180]   to false belief and courageously regained.
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.160]   Lawrence Wright.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.100]   A billion years, my escape from a life
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.100]   in the highest ranks of Scientology, Mike Rinder.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.500]   - It's a fantastic book.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.100]   He also narrates his own audio book too.
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.620]   I know you like the audio books, that's how I listen to it.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:05.380]   So Mike famously, I just said a moment ago,
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.680]   like someone who's treated so horribly,
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.380]   even though he still believed in Scientology,
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.380]   he had no choice but to leave.
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:13.540]   And he tells the story in that book
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:15.540]   and he still believed in Scientology for years
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:18.180]   after he escaped, for years.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.220]   'Cause there's this thing called
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.740]   the Independent Scientology Movement
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.580]   or the Free Zone or whatever.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.780]   There are people who do Scientology
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.160]   outside of the Church of Scientology.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.420]   There's just not many of them.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.140]   But Mike was one of those people
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.620]   who was actually doing Scientology even after he left.
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.940]   Now he no longer believes in that anymore
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.140]   and he doesn't do it.
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.020]   But even though he still believed,
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.980]   even though everything he knew
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:39.860]   was what he was leaving behind,
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.620]   he still had to leave it behind.
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.460]   - And by the way, I just opened a random page
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.820]   and he says, "When I signed on for Sea Org
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.960]   "in Adelaide in 1973, the recruiter promised
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.400]   "I would train as a Scientology executive
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.800]   "under the direct tutelage of Hubbard on the Apollo."
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.700]   So this is another thing I should probably ask you about.
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.860]   - Oh, we could go for days.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.780]   - I was also told that after I learned
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:05.420]   all I needed to learn at the foot of the Master,
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:06.900]   I would return to Australia
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.260]   to help expand Scientology in my home country.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:14.420]   So what was the thing that really broke him?
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:19.060]   - The final thing is when he got to a point
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.300]   where he was no longer being forced
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.780]   to lie to protect L. Ron Hubbard.
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.620]   He was now being forced to lie to protect David Miscavige.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.740]   And specifically, it was about the allegations
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.200]   of having been assaulted by Miscavige.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.720]   Mike Rinder was at some event,
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.300]   it might have been a grand opening for a building,
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.300]   a Scientology building in London.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.980]   And I believe it was John Sweeney,
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.580]   at that time a BBC journalist,
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.860]   who stuck a camera and a microphone in Mike's face.
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.380]   "Is it true David Miscavige assaulted, is it true?"
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.500]   And Mike denied it on camera.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.980]   And then turned around and to himself is like,
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:58.040]   "This is what my life has been reduced to?
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.000]   "Lying to protect David Miscavige?
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.140]   "This used to be about L. Ron Hubbard.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.020]   "This used to be about Scientology.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.780]   "Now it's about protecting this douchebag?"
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:11.900]   And Miscavige had just issued orders
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:15.660]   that was gonna send Mike off to Australia.
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.500]   Like Miscavige is sadistic.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.680]   That is without question.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.940]   - Sadistic meaning?
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.620]   - He enjoys inflicting pain upon others.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:26.660]   So he very specifically was gonna tell Mike,
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.140]   tell Rinder or tell that cocksucker,
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:30.560]   "We're shipping him off to Australia.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.260]   "He's never gonna see his wife and his kids again."
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.420]   Essentially.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:35.120]   And that's when Mike was like,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.620]   "They were the only reason I hadn't already left.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:42.000]   "So if I follow the orders, I'm gonna lose 'em.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.740]   "If I leave Scientology, I'm gonna lose 'em.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.460]   "At least if I leave Scientology,
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.220]   "I'll be free of something."
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.220]   It's fucking sad.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.500]   - And he still believed Scientology
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.100]   to some degree after he left, is what you're saying?
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:37:59.940]   - Yeah.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.740]   - Has he spoken about what it took to let go
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.820]   of believing in Scientology?
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.400]   - He does a very good job talking about
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.560]   all of this in the book.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.560]   And it took him like four or five years
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.400]   to get that book done.
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.640]   It's a polished version.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.200]   It's a polished version of his story.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.320]   And I think Mike's about getting ready
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.400]   to start his own YouTube channel.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.280]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.060]   Actually, Mike comes on my channel all the time.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.920]   - Yeah, you guys do a thing together, right?
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.520]   - Yeah, we do Three Amigos
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.960]   with me and Mike Rinder and Mark Hedley.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.680]   That's why I gave you Mark's book.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.280]   I thought maybe you would know him
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.480]   from our little Three Amigos,
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.540]   our Mondays with Mike and Mark videos.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:38.200]   - Mark Hedley, blown for good
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.360]   behind the iron curtain of Scientology.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.880]   - So he escaped from the International Base on a motorcycle.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.660]   It's a wild story.
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:45.500]   - Nice.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.560]   - I won't even try to do it justice.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.280]   - Who's a better writer of the two of them?
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.760]   (laughing)
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.560]   - You're not gonna get me there.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.520]   - I'm trying to be investigative journalist for once.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.420]   - Mike and Mark are both on the board
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.920]   of the Aftermath Foundation with me.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:58.840]   - Who's better looking?
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.280]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.960]   - It's one of my justifications
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.320]   for just putting up content every day
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.600]   is every video is just an excuse to,
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.600]   in some little way, promote the Aftermath Foundation.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.280]   And I do that again, one, to genuinely help people escape,
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.840]   and two, 'cause I know it drives David Miscavige crazy.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.540]   - If you look in your own heart, is there anger there?
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:19.300]   - I don't think it's anger.
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.480]   I don't hate Scientology.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.760]   I don't hate David Miscavige.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.880]   I don't even hate my experience in Scientology.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.480]   - Do you able to accept the good from your experience?
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.080]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.360]   But it's also the only path that I traveled.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.760]   So I tend, okay, a little less so these days,
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.520]   but earlier in life, I tended to attribute
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.400]   all positive characteristics in me to Scientology,
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.680]   'cause in my simplistic way of thinking, I was like,
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.800]   what else could it possibly be attributed to?
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.240]   That's a very black and white way of seeing it.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.680]   - Well, it's a beautiful way to see life.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.280]   No matter what happens to you, you attribute,
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.680]   like you focus on the positive,
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.280]   and you feel like sometimes people have traumatic experiences
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.640]   with parents and so on.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.480]   And if you focus on the positive,
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.920]   it's a good way to let go of the trauma associated with it.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.800]   - True.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.040]   But like another example would be like,
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.240]   I didn't go to school, like I stopped going to school
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.640]   in the seventh grade, but people go,
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.440]   but you sound so smart.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.360]   And what am I supposed to do?
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.240]   Am I supposed to say, well, it's 'cause of Scientology?
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.240]   Like, how do I answer that question?
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.480]   Like, if it's the only path I traveled,
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.680]   how do I answer that question?
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.480]   I don't necessarily wanna give Scientology credit,
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.920]   but what the hell am I supposed to point to?
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.880]   - Sure. - You know?
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.760]   I mean, you said you kind of enjoy,
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.480]   I mean, part of it is you joking and trolling,
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.380]   that you enjoy knowing that your YouTube channel
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:38.160]   drives Dave Miscavige crazy.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.600]   I mean, what, that means you still,
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.880]   I mean, there is a joy you have.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:44.720]   - There is a joy.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   I'm not gonna deny that.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.960]   - I don't know what to make of that.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.780]   'Cause there's a, I suppose there's an intimacy
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.960]   when you're part of a tribe of that kind.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:56.560]   - It's almost like, let me try to frame it.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.320]   I wasn't trying to get kicked out of Scientology.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.180]   I was trying to not get kicked out of Scientology.
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:06.000]   So what happened, first my mom got kicked out
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.520]   for basically talking some smack about David Miscavige.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.680]   And then they go to me and they go,
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.680]   okay, you've gotta disconnect from your mom
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.360]   or you're gonna get kicked out.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.200]   And I lied about that.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.760]   I was like, okay, I'll disconnect.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:17.600]   But I never did.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.440]   For a couple years, I lied my ass off about it.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.560]   Eventually, they were like,
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.320]   this guy's gonna keep lying to us, right?
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.160]   And they're like, yeah.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.180]   Like, all right, you're out.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.100]   So then they go to my wife,
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:26.160]   say, you gotta divorce your husband
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.200]   or you're gonna get kicked out.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.080]   And she goes, no.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:36.480]   - That's a hell of a statement from her.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.600]   It's gonna get harder from here.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.120]   So I'm not quite sure how to.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.760]   - Okay, I'll try to get, I'll try to do my best.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:46.520]   - You don't seem like a man who's afraid of hard things.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:50.000]   - Okay, so she's like, no.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.800]   So then they go to her parents.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.600]   And they say, you've got to disconnect from your daughter
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.280]   and your three granddaughters
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.120]   or you're gonna get kicked out.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:08.560]   But they have three other kids who are Scientologists,
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.360]   who have spouses who are Scientologists,
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.520]   who have grandkids.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.040]   So I feel like up until that point,
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.840]   everybody was sort of making a decision for themselves
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.280]   and what would be best for themselves
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.360]   until they get to her parents.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.880]   And then they're like, which grandkids are we gonna lose?
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.320]   Okay?
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.640]   At the part where they were trying to get me
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.320]   to disconnect from my mom,
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.160]   there were hours that I spent talking to them going,
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.480]   you know, guys, there's another way.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.680]   It doesn't have to go this way.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.400]   There's another way that ends well for all of us.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.240]   And that wasn't even considered.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.100]   And I go, like, they created this monster.
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:55.980]   And that's a fact.
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:59.380]   And that's why I take joy in it.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:02.100]   When people ask me, is Scientology a destructive cult?
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.860]   I don't even have to get into all the academic discussions
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.100]   of what's a religion and what's a cult
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:06.940]   and what's the difference.
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.900]   I go, as long as they destroy families like that,
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:10.740]   they're a cult.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:17.340]   - So they cut people off deliberately, one by one.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:22.620]   And it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.620]   - Right.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.660]   - And why is it that way?
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.820]   - I mean, it started with L. Ron Hubbard
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:31.100]   laying out a policy framework, a policy structure,
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:36.100]   that if interpreted and applied in the worst possible way,
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:39.460]   with the worst possible judgment,
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.140]   can be abused in that way.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:43.260]   I would make the argument
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:46.460]   that if an anti-broker had taken over,
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.060]   that Scientology policy does have enough
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.380]   little caveats baked into it
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.780]   that even the policies about disconnection
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:57.380]   could be interpreted and implemented
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.500]   in a non-destructive way.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:03.800]   There is room for judgment and discretion.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.620]   And Miscavige has just created
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:09.340]   the worst possible version of Scientology.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:11.820]   And that's where you sort of get that argument of,
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:14.360]   does he even want Scientology to succeed?
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.780]   'Cause he seems to be hell-bent
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:18.340]   on making sure that he doesn't.
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.180]   - Yeah.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:23.300]   - And I don't want to see him make it succeed,
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.820]   but it does bring that question up of like,
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:27.860]   what are his motivations?
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.980]   Can he not see that he's destroying the thing
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:32.100]   he's supposed to be expanding?
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.800]   - That's also, you know, there's ways to measure cost.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:41.380]   And that would probably be the most costly aspect
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:44.500]   of Scientology, is the suffering associated
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:46.180]   with the separating of families.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:47.020]   - Yeah.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:49.940]   - And that actually just puts, makes it very concrete
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:52.380]   what we value in human life,
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:54.580]   is the connection to our loved ones.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.700]   Like everything else doesn't matter.
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.020]   Like getting 50 bucks a week.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:05.060]   Getting money stolen from you,
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:07.260]   getting the truth stolen from you,
[01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:08.980]   none of that compares.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.700]   You can even frame that as the good.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.180]   There could be a lot of positives, whatever, in the tribe.
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.380]   But separating families, separating loved ones,
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:18.820]   that's the destructive thing.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:21.740]   - So no hate though?
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:24.180]   - No, I genuinely don't hate them.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.540]   - Do you forgive them?
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:26.840]   - 100%.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:29.900]   There's no one I look at in Scientology that I go,
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:30.740]   how dare you?
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:34.140]   If I was in their shoes, having to, you know,
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:35.580]   operate under David Miscavige's orders,
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.340]   I would have done the same thing,
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:38.980]   and I would have loved it.
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:41.560]   Truthfully, I don't blame any of them.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.420]   I mean, I take the opposite approach.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:47.080]   If they knew what I knew, they'd be doing what I'm doing.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.700]   If they knew what I knew and believed it,
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.940]   they'd be doing what I'm doing.
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.340]   They're not dumb.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:54.140]   It's not dumb people in Scientology.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:58.340]   - They're ambitious, they're dreamers,
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.420]   they got hope, they're driven, all that kind of stuff.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:02.500]   - Yeah.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:05.620]   And it's one of the reasons I like putting up content
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.380]   on my channel so they can see, hey,
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:09.140]   like if you're a Scientologist,
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.620]   you look at that and you go, hey,
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:13.100]   he seems like he's doing well, he's happy,
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.220]   he's a positive guy, he's a good communicator,
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.500]   he knows what he's talking about,
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.540]   he's not lying, he's not exaggerating.
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.540]   I don't exaggerate anything on my channel.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:23.560]   I don't make up anything.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.620]   And this actually comes from an experience I had
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.140]   from 1998 to 2000.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.900]   I was living in LA, I sort of had a two-year period
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:31.940]   in my life where I actually had
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:33.700]   almost no contact with Scientology.
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:38.500]   And during that time, I found my way onto the internet.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:40.100]   And there was a website, it might have been
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.900]   ESMB, X Scientology message, but whatever it was,
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:46.140]   it was at that time the main source of critical information
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:47.820]   about Scientology on the internet.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.860]   And I looked at it, and remember,
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:50.980]   I was still a true believer.
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:55.260]   And I looked at this and it was so offensive,
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.860]   insulting, hyperbolic, exaggerated,
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:00.680]   I was like, oh, just a bunch of bullshit.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.140]   I was in Scientology for 16 more years.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:10.280]   If what I had seen on the internet
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:11.900]   about critical of Scientology,
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:13.860]   if what I had seen when I had seen it
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.700]   was something that actually resonated with me,
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:20.020]   that I was like, oh, that I believed was true,
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.020]   that seemed credible, I would have gotten out
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.340]   of Scientology 16 years earlier.
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:29.140]   So I was like, how can I help create an experience
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:32.760]   on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it,
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:36.140]   it will resonate with them instead of repelling them?
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.820]   And that is exactly what I have set out to do
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.540]   and what I believe I've accomplished.
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:42.340]   - There's the content, the message,
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.780]   but also just showing that you can be happy
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:45.900]   outside of Scientology.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:46.740]   - Exactly.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.740]   - You can have a fulfilling life, you can be a good man.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:49.980]   - Yeah. - All that.
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:54.140]   What benefit do you think Tom Cruise gets from Scientology?
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:55.780]   So why is he still in Scientology?
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:57.500]   - He genuinely loves it.
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.540]   And also, Miscavige does, there's one celebrity
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:03.900]   who does have the most unique experience in Scientology,
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.240]   and that is Tom.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.580]   Scientology hires all of Tom's staff.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:13.020]   All of Tom's staff are subject to interrogations
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.080]   by Scientology, not only in the hiring process,
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.940]   but during the employment.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:21.580]   David Miscavige on Scientology runs Tom Cruise's life
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.860]   and his production company and his household staff.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.700]   - Do you imagine there's some personal connection there
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.780]   where they like each other a lot?
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:30.500]   - Best friends.
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:33.900]   I mean, it's them against the world is how they see it.
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.420]   I think it's pretty easy to see how that works
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:37.540]   between the two of them.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:40.100]   I think this idea of them against the world,
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.900]   us against the world, is a really powerful, intimate,
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:47.500]   I kind of see like friendships and relationships that way.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:50.380]   I mean, not in a dark sense, but it's like,
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:53.260]   the world is full of cruelty and absurdity
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.740]   and unfairness and so on.
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:57.020]   It's nice to huddle together like the penguins
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.300]   in March of the People against the cold.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.740]   - 100%. - And they're just like,
[01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:05.740]   and so, especially with the ideology of Scientology,
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:11.740]   this idea that you can be anything,
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:15.500]   you can essentially, I mean, you can manifest it,
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.380]   essentially, through like believing it.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:20.860]   I mean, you don't really put it into those words,
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:23.820]   but believing that you're a god
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:28.580]   is a really like inspiring, positive thing to think.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:30.420]   - If they could figure out how to do all that
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:33.320]   without destroying families and bankrupting its members,
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.240]   they might actually have a future.
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.300]   That's why, like it's funny,
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.860]   'cause sometimes I feel like it's like,
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:40.180]   like I'm rooting for them to like succeed and do it right,
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:43.500]   and I'm not, but it's an interesting academic discussion
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:47.420]   to have of like, we can all see how much people
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.700]   will sacrifice in the names of belief and religion.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:52.340]   We can see how much Scientologists sacrifice
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:54.100]   based on what they already believe.
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:59.260]   If you would just start treating people less horribly,
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.060]   you know what I'm saying?
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.980]   It might actually have a future.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:04.380]   Not that I want it to.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.800]   It seems like this dark lesson of human nature
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:11.800]   that there's something about, to use the word cults,
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.280]   that you just stop seeing reality for what it is.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.880]   There's a lot of things that could make this
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.880]   a better organization that's actually helping people flourish
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:28.040]   and be a little bit more like loose about membership,
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.240]   not dividing families, not causing suffering,
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.540]   not causing financial harm,
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:35.200]   but actually inspiring people and helping people.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.120]   But then maybe it fundamentally changes
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.640]   what the organization is.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.800]   And maybe that means somebody like David Miscavige
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.320]   loses power too, which might be very difficult,
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.280]   or people that are close to him lose power,
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.760]   and people hold onto power.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:51.280]   Whatever the human forces here,
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:55.360]   it seems to become worse and worse over time.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.240]   What about, oh, let me ask a conspiracy question.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:02.440]   Is there a chance that Tom Cruise is being blackmailed?
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.760]   That there's information from auditing?
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.600]   No? - No.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.280]   - So that kind of stuff is not, that's very conspiratorial.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.480]   - I've actually come out and said definitively,
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:13.160]   I do not know of a single person who stays in Scientology
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:14.640]   because they're afraid of being blackmailed.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.800]   It's just not a thing.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.500]   It's just not a thing.
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.380]   Does Scientology have enough information
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:22.560]   to blackmail someone if they wanted to?
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:23.840]   Well, sure.
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.320]   I mean, and it doesn't even have to be true.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.160]   It could just be lies.
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:26.980]   Who cares?
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:27.820]   Who knows?
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.720]   Scientology can say whatever the hell they want.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.960]   So that's the thing, it doesn't even have to be true.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.260]   And actually, that would be the argument against blackmailing.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:34.960]   Like in order for Scientology to blackmail you
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.920]   with that information, they'd actually have to represent
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.860]   that yes, he really did tell us this.
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.400]   And it's like, well, then why are you spilling secrets
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.240]   of members, right?
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.560]   Like it sets a bad precedent.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.760]   - What are some of the sins according to Scientology?
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:49.360]   - Most of the sins from a Scientology perspective
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:52.480]   are just doing or saying anything that brings disrepute
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:54.580]   to Scientology itself, right?
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:59.600]   Remember, it's not like Christianity where there's rules.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.640]   If you break this rule, you're not getting into heaven.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.920]   'Cause Scientology doesn't think about things that way.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:03.960]   - Oh, there's the drug.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.960]   You can't do drugs, right?
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.400]   - You can't do drugs.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:11.560]   And you can't take any psychotropic medications.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.280]   - And no medications almost at all?
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.520]   - You're allowed to take medications.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:17.740]   It's just, there's no rules expressly prohibiting it.
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:20.000]   It's just most Scientologists tend not to.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.360]   You can take Advil, but many Scientologists won't.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.040]   - Okay.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.900]   - You just can't take anything prescribed
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:28.400]   by a psychiatrist, a psychologist,
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.280]   or any drugs that are psychotropic drugs.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.100]   I mean, SSRIs are considered probably the closest thing
[01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:37.520]   to pure evil in the world of Scientology.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:40.040]   - What about, weird question, what about sex?
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.880]   Is there boundaries on what's?
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:43.200]   - There used to not be.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:46.920]   It's become very puritanical in the last many decades.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.920]   For a reason I can't actually explain.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.760]   Like, miscavige does seem to be infatuated
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.020]   with controlling sex.
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:57.780]   Like, that is one thing about miscavige version
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.360]   of Scientology that's gotten very strange.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.640]   I mean, L. Ron Hubbard even specifically wrote a policy
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.640]   that says we are no longer going to regulate
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.520]   in any way the bedroom activities of people.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.200]   He literally said, from this point on,
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.800]   no one is allowed to be subject to any justice actions
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:17.400]   of any kind whatsoever for anything they do
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.140]   in their sexual lives.
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:21.400]   But that still did not give permission
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.360]   for gay relationships.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.860]   That was still referring to straight stuff.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.880]   - And monogamous only.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:30.320]   Can you do open marriages and open relationships?
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.680]   - According to L. Ron Hubbard policy, you can.
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:33.640]   - Yeah, but you know.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.560]   - I think he wrote that policy before he created
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.000]   the C organization.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.920]   And then what happened is, this is actually
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.800]   how this came into effect.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.340]   He created the C organization.
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:43.760]   You had a lot of people on a ship,
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.120]   and everybody was just banging each other,
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:49.040]   and it created just a nightmare of personal relationship.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.580]   It was making production impossible.
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:52.520]   Not 'cause everybody was spending so much time banging,
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:54.480]   but because everybody was so upset
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:56.040]   about who was banging who.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:56.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.040]   (laughing)
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.960]   I mean, sex and that kind of dynamic is really,
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.800]   I mean, humans do what humans do,
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.440]   and then there's drama and all that.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.880]   It's understandable, 'cause everybody's so intimate.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:12.080]   It's a closed tribe.
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:13.760]   It makes sense to limit sex.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.800]   Otherwise, it becomes a sex cult,
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.160]   which a lot of them end up becoming.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.680]   On that topic, would you classify Scientology as a cult?
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.040]   - 100%.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.320]   But not because I'm fully conversant
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.840]   with the academic differentiations
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.380]   between what's a religion and what's a cult.
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.220]   I mean, Scientology would say,
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.920]   "Well, all small new religions are cults."
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.400]   And I don't know, that's probably true.
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.080]   Some people would say, "All religions are cults."
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.960]   And I'd be like, "Depends on how you define religion,
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.680]   "and it depends on how you define cult."
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.720]   But I just fall back on my thing of,
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.360]   if you're destroying families and bankrupting your members,
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:46.300]   you're a cult.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:49.240]   That's how I look at it.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.280]   - It's us versus them, and the them could be your family,
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.640]   it could be your loved ones.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.160]   That's deeply destructive,
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.920]   and one of the things you would probably throw
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.080]   into the definition of a cult
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.800]   is something that's actually destructive.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:06.680]   'Cause I do a lot of stuff that's cult-like, like Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.880]   There's a lot of really close-knit tribes,
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:12.440]   but there's no negative toxicity to it.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.960]   There's no divide, there's no divisions.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:20.960]   Or if there is, it's more, boy.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.360]   Try being a fan of a certain soccer team
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.080]   and then becoming a fan of another soccer team.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.040]   - That's hardcore.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.360]   - And they (exhales)
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.120]   (Zubin laughs)
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.840]   - But I'll tell you, I train Jiu-Jitsu as well,
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:34.160]   and I have found that community of people
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.240]   to be one of the most loving
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.680]   and helpful group of people ever.
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:44.600]   Shout out to John Keller, Gracie Baja Clearwater.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:47.920]   No, but seriously, it's one of the reasons
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.880]   I continue to do it, despite my back, my hip, my shoulder.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.480]   It's like, it's just such a cool group of guys.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.320]   - Goes on.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.720]   I think it was much more divisive in the beginning
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.600]   from the Brazilian roots.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.000]   One of the things that's really hard
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.600]   is the team-oriented.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.680]   If you're this team, you're ride or die with this team,
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:10.160]   and there's no, there's the Crianchas,
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:12.160]   they go to another team.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:14.240]   And I think that aspect, that was actually a turnoff
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.520]   for me in the beginning, that the toxicity of that.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:21.480]   Because I understand that a little bit for the elites,
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:23.400]   for the highest of the highest.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.880]   That there is, I like the brotherhood
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.320]   and the loyalty of the people,
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.520]   like the Olympic gold medalists,
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:29.520]   the best in the world, yes.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:32.200]   But for recreational fun, it's like,
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:34.160]   this is ultimately about the camaraderie
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.400]   of all human beings together,
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.760]   not some, whatever label you put on yourself.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:40.680]   I don't think we actually talked
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:42.080]   about the organization itself.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.600]   We talked about tax-exempt status,
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:46.340]   which is really important.
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:48.120]   We talked about some of the control,
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:51.840]   like through the propaganda control of what's out there.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.000]   It's actually interesting that you said that
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.520]   Scientology has pretty much lost the battle
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.880]   with the internet at this point.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:56:59.720]   - Oh yeah.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:02.000]   - Which is kind of inspiring
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.900]   that it's hard to defeat the internet.
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:08.040]   But then there's bots that are,
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.320]   I think if you're sophisticated,
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.560]   I'm not sure that's true.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.400]   But if you're not--
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:12.600]   - It's kind of remarkable they haven't been able
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:13.920]   to capitalize on these bot armies.
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.060]   'Cause there's one thing that they have,
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.120]   it's a lot of tax-free money
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.400]   that they got nothing else better to do.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:19.120]   - Yeah, right, they can invest.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.640]   - They just, they should give you a call.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:23.140]   Like they just don't have the right people apparently.
[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:27.560]   - But that said, how do they wield influence
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.320]   with government agencies?
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:33.960]   You've talked about the local police enforcement,
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.600]   also federal agencies, anything.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.240]   - That is the one way they effectively
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:40.480]   put their money to use, is lobbyists and attorneys,
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:43.760]   judges, very rarely have they ever been able
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.620]   just to get a politician on their side.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.700]   It's the behind the scenes people.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.180]   Greta Van Susteren's a very high level
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:50.620]   long-term Scientologist.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:52.220]   And her husband, I always get it wrong,
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:55.220]   it's either Jim Cole or John Cole, I always get it wrong.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:56.740]   He's a very powerful attorney
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:58:01.340]   who has a lot, wields a lot of influence behind the scenes.
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.940]   And that's just one example.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:05.060]   Like the reason why that's an interesting example
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.460]   is 'cause he's actually a Scientologist
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.180]   and he travels in those circles.
[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:12.780]   Scientology though, its money goes to good use
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:15.420]   by hiring non-Scientologists, retired judges,
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.580]   attorneys, lobbyists.
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.660]   It really is how they get almost anything done.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.900]   Like Miscavige himself is not hobnobbing
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:23.900]   and glad hanging and shaking hands and meeting these folks.
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:27.260]   It's the non-Scientologist professionals
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:31.740]   who work behind the scenes on Scientology's behalf.
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:33.300]   - Can you describe the dynamics of that,
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:35.020]   how that actually happens?
[01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:37.980]   Like why would the police department work
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:39.260]   on behalf of Scientology?
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.680]   - I meant more the courts and regulators,
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:42.640]   not the police department.
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:43.940]   But well, for example,
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:46.060]   it can come down to something as simple as this.
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:49.220]   In Clearwater, Scientology hires Clearwater police
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:50.900]   to do off-duty work for them.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:53.660]   They pay like three times the normal off-duty rate.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:56.800]   So they will, even though I'm not aware of anyone
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.540]   on the Clearwater PD who's actually a Scientologist,
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:00.780]   they basically end up with,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:02.700]   they would call them allies or safe points.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:03.540]   - Got it. - Right?
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:07.980]   People who like will literally operate as Scientology spies.
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:10.460]   Someone comes in and follows a report
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:12.520]   about some child sex case.
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.200]   Someone in the Clearwater PD is calling Sarah Heller
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:17.280]   at the Office of Special Affairs at the Flying Aladdin Base
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:20.000]   to let her know, "Hey, heads up, we got a thing coming in."
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.760]   And then Scientology can run around
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.440]   and go talk to all the Scientologists
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.380]   who have knowledge about this
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.080]   and either get them out of Clearwater, you know.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:30.300]   - So it's not like a direct explicit corruption,
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:34.960]   but more just friends and coworkers
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:37.240]   integrated deeply in the community.
[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:39.320]   - Yeah, I call it soft corruption.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:43.920]   So another example, you have the mayor of Clearwater,
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:47.320]   Frank Hibbard, well, he used to,
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.980]   when he won his recent election,
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:51.460]   he stepped down from some of these nonprofits
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:52.440]   that he served on.
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.720]   But the nonprofits that he served on
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:56.360]   also gets millions of dollars of donations
[01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:59.840]   from some of Scientology's richest Clearwater members, right?
[01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:04.220]   You have one of the mayor's best friends, Joe Burdette,
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:06.800]   literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:10.720]   So that creates a chilling effect
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.720]   on anyone who's gonna be talking smack about Scientology
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:19.600]   because his friends are on their damn payroll.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:21.960]   So I call it soft corruption.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:24.260]   It's not illegal, it's not illegal,
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:27.960]   but it's how Scientology wields influence.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.800]   And what's ironic is that a lot of these people
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.080]   who work on Scientology's behalf
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.480]   actually secretly hate Scientology.
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.200]   They kind of see through it, but it's part of the community.
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.600]   I mean, it's deeply integrated in the community,
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.160]   and there's financial leverage.
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.840]   Are you ever afraid?
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.400]   I mean, afraid for your well-being,
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.680]   afraid for your ability to function in society
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.800]   because of the pressures from Scientology?
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:52.640]   - No.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.120]   - Is that because you're genetically malfunctioning
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.880]   or mentally, or is there,
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.360]   speaking out is a kind of protection?
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.320]   - I think it's one of those things
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.040]   that once you've seen behind the curtain
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.800]   and you see the Wizard of Oz is just a silly man,
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.960]   you just don't have any fear.
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:08.800]   Now, it's one of these things,
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:10.040]   like people will say, "Oh, you're so brave."
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:11.560]   And I go, "Eh, what's that quote?"
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.920]   Bravery is being a soldier
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.400]   and being afraid and going in any way.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.920]   It's not brave to run in if you don't think
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:19.360]   nothing's gonna happen to you.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:23.520]   I do not hold myself up as an example of bravery
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.340]   'cause it's not like, "Oh, they could destroy me,
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:27.180]   "but I don't care."
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:29.320]   No, there's not a damn thing they can do to me.
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:31.760]   And that's one of the reasons
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:33.680]   I continue to put out content every day.
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.460]   To just basically go, "Hey, still here.
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.520]   "I dare you to try to do something about it, but you can't."
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:43.320]   And hope that that also serves as kind of an example
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:46.200]   for other people to go, "If this schmo can do it
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:47.420]   "and they can't do anything else to him,
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.360]   "then maybe I can do it too."
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:50.200]   'Cause I would love it.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.800]   I would love there to be 20 channels
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:55.700]   where former Scientologists talk about their experience.
[02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:56.900]   - I mean, that is bravery
[02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:59.180]   because what happens is fear seeps in
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:01.600]   even if it's not grounded in reality.
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:05.520]   But at the same time, my grandfather
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:09.640]   who fought in World War II,
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:13.040]   I mean, the story is, I mean, he was very convinced
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:16.600]   and sure most of the people he fought alongside with died.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:18.080]   He was a machine gunner,
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.600]   but he believed that bullets can't hit him.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:21.440]   Right? - That's what he said?
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.240]   Well, you know, he was right.
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:27.500]   Right?
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:28.340]   'Cause he survived.
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:30.160]   So there's some sense like you're--
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:31.500]   - Survivor bias.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:32.960]   - That he's like, just like you are.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:34.000]   He was like, "I'm not brave.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.680]   "I just, bullets can't hit me."
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.640]   (laughing)
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.840]   I mean, there's a dark kind of truth to that.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:42.720]   There's some, you know, it's like a,
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:45.480]   it's a feedback loop where if you have the confidence
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.400]   and you push on forward and you're brave in that way
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:50.760]   to not let fear seep in and affect you,
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:54.520]   it actually gives you less things to be scared about.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:57.040]   I mean, but that initial few steps might be,
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:01.280]   for people, it might be a very difficult step to take
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:02.420]   to talk about it publicly.
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.380]   - The fear was knowing how the family
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:09.000]   was gonna be destroyed and trying to prevent that.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.340]   I was terrified of that happening.
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.300]   But it happened.
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:16.380]   There's nothing left to be afraid of.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:17.220]   And that's kind of the thing.
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:18.780]   Like, they created this beast.
[02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:20.060]   And the same is true for Mark Hedley.
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.220]   The same is true for Mike Rinder.
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:23.380]   I said, they've essentially created
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:24.980]   a Scientology-proof virus,
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:27.380]   Scientology-resistant strain,
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:30.940]   by throwing everything they have at us
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:32.700]   for so many years.
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:36.460]   They have just, through natural selection,
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:38.940]   created people who just do not give a damn
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:40.660]   about anything they could or would do.
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.180]   And maybe there is something a little wrong with me.
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:44.140]   'Cause when I get a phone call from someone like,
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:45.580]   I just got this phone call about you,
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:47.500]   and it's clear that it's Scientology PIs
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:50.820]   doing work behind the scenes, I get really excited.
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:51.800]   I get really excited.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:52.740]   I don't get nervous.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:53.980]   I don't go, oh no, it's happening.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:56.600]   I'm like, oh yeah, this is gonna be exciting.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.580]   I'm like, okay.
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.860]   Because everything they try to do to me,
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:03.820]   I'm gonna figure out how to reflect it back on them
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:05.020]   and make them look ridiculous.
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.340]   - And that pales in comparison
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:07.700]   to the separating from family.
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:08.540]   - Exactly.
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:11.140]   - Is there parts of your family
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:13.800]   that you've lost because of Scientology?
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:18.940]   - Just, yeah.
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:21.020]   If you...
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:28.820]   Most of my episode
[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:32.060]   on the Lee Remedy in the Aftermath show
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:35.220]   was talking about me and my twin brother.
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:40.020]   It's just a pretty horrible story.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.180]   It's just a pretty horrible story.
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:42.600]   So I do have a younger brother
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:44.700]   who's still in Scientology and disconnected from me,
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:47.880]   but I never had much of a relationship with that brother,
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.300]   really, to begin with.
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.360]   But my twin brother died when I was like 23 or 24.
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:01.060]   And that was, without any question,
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:06.060]   a direct result of our Scientology experience.
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:08.780]   He died in a car accident
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:10.420]   that wasn't technically his fault or anything.
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:11.940]   He wasn't even the one driving.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:16.820]   But the specific fact of his death was not,
[02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:19.980]   meaning the fact and the manner of his death
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:22.780]   wasn't specifically because of Scientology.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:27.780]   But our story and where our relationship got to,
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:30.540]   and how he was even in a position
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:32.940]   of having something like that happen to him
[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:35.620]   is directly attributable to Scientology.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:38.500]   - Do you think about him?
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:39.340]   Miss him?
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:44.260]   Is part of what you're doing in memory of him?
[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:45.460]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:48.500]   - Man, this is such a--
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.140]   - I mean, we were identical twins.
[02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:51.380]   Can you imagine two of me?
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:54.260]   - I can barely handle one.
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:56.580]   - I love it.
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:00.540]   - Losing him, would that be the darkest moment
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.540]   in this whole journey of Scientology for you?
[02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:07.260]   - Two moments would equal the darkest moment.
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:12.260]   It would be that and also just the period of,
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:16.580]   six, nine, 12 months of impending doom.
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:21.760]   Knowing that my wife's whole family
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:23.100]   was gonna be obliterated
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:26.940]   and that there's nothing we could do about it.
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:32.940]   And kind of telling ourselves every step of the way
[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:34.800]   it wasn't really gonna happen.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:41.660]   And I really felt like, you ever watch the Ozarks?
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:44.180]   I felt like Marty Bird.
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:45.740]   Now, this was happening before the Ozarks,
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:49.280]   but when I watched the Ozarks and I see that character,
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:52.660]   the entire world is crumbling down around him
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:55.740]   and all he can, all he did was like,
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:57.780]   all right, what's the next step?
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:00.100]   I watch Marty Bird and I go,
[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:01.700]   that's my fucking spirit animal.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:06.180]   Because you can only control what you can control.
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:10.460]   And you can't keep Scientology from destroying your family.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:14.060]   And literally, it's funny, I mention this show a lot
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.660]   because I watch that and I go,
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.960]   that's exactly how I felt.
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:20.660]   I talk about this six months or nine, 12 months,
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:22.380]   whatever it was, of impending doom.
[02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.180]   It's not like I was an emotional wreck during that time.
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:29.220]   In private, I was, but it's not like I was just freaking out.
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:32.220]   It was like, the sun's gonna come up tomorrow,
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:34.740]   the world's gonna keep spinning, I can't control it,
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:37.280]   this is hard, I can't believe this is happening.
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:40.500]   But tomorrow's a new day.
[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:45.940]   I've never personally, even at the darkest times,
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:48.060]   I've never experienced anything
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.700]   that I would characterize as depression.
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:52.940]   Certainly not ever any suicidal thoughts or anything.
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:55.500]   Even in the darkest of times, and again,
[02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:57.300]   this one thing I go, is it because of Scientology
[02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:58.340]   or is it just me?
[02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:00.340]   There really is an emotional detachment.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:04.100]   There almost has to be.
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.500]   - And it's a cold calculation.
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:07.900]   What are my options?
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.240]   What do I do here?
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:11.980]   - And then once I figure out the answer to that question,
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.780]   I'm actually quite chipper and happy.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:16.600]   That's sort of my default.
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.540]   You could give me six horrible options.
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:20.460]   Once I figure out the best of those six,
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:22.980]   I'm gonna feel like I just had a pretty good day.
[02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:24.220]   - That's brilliant.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:27.500]   'Cause just watching Ozarks is so stressful.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:28.340]   - It is, right?
[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:29.640]   - So stressful watching it.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:34.160]   And he usually finds a way,
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:37.540]   and usually it is a set of really bad options,
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.380]   and it's one of the bad options,
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:41.220]   but it's the best of the bad options.
[02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:43.540]   - And he almost gets pissed off at everyone around him
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:45.100]   for being so pouty about it.
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.340]   (laughing)
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:49.340]   - But you know-- - I'll never watch
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.460]   that show again, same way again.
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:52.300]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:53.340]   - But you know, it's like, you know,
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.460]   it's still simmering there right under the surface,
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:57.540]   like pretty damn close to the surface.
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:58.380]   Do you know what I mean?
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:08:59.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:03.460]   - And people sometimes ask about recovery and whatnot,
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.340]   and like, what does that look like, and what does that mean?
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:06.660]   And it sort of goes back to kind of
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:08.460]   the emotional detachment, is I go,
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.940]   what the fuck does recovery even mean?
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:12.940]   If you're an alcoholic and you're recovering,
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:13.780]   you know what that means.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:15.540]   I used to drink, I don't drink now.
[02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:17.900]   Well, I used to be in a cult, and I'm not in a cult now.
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.700]   How else am I supposed to feel about this
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:22.260]   for someone to be like, it seems like you've recovered.
[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:24.060]   What the fuck does that even mean?
[02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:27.300]   Like, I'm sure some academic has an answer to that question.
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.340]   I'm not someone who particularly,
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:30.180]   I don't spend any time thinking about that.
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:32.380]   My recovery is success,
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.340]   and a little bit of trolling and revenge.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:36.980]   But mostly success, you know?
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:38.940]   What does it mean to be a recovered former cult member?
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:41.100]   What, you don't cry when people ask you about your brother?
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:43.180]   I don't know what it means.
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:46.540]   I've never had therapy, but not because I'm still, like,
[02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:48.260]   against it from Scientology.
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:52.180]   I just, like, I'm not gonna pay to talk to someone.
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.220]   Do you know where else I could do that? Scientology.
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.620]   Now, I know there's a lot of people going like, oh boy.
[02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:59.080]   I know there's a lot, I'm not shitting on therapy.
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.220]   I would rather have a beer with my friend
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:03.660]   and talk about this shit
[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:05.740]   than talk to a professional for $200 an hour.
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:07.060]   - That's the kind of therapy, yeah.
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:07.900]   - Yeah.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.740]   - Yeah, listen, that's the part of the reason
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:12.780]   I do this podcast, is talking to people
[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:15.900]   that you care about, that you're close with,
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.780]   this is a really powerful, powerful thing.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:19.420]   But yeah, I don't know what recovery looks like.
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:23.580]   And success to you is defined, just be, find happiness.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:27.160]   Find happiness outside the closed bubble
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.380]   that defines what happiness looks like on Scientology.
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:33.580]   - If I can make my kids happy, that's success to me.
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:35.300]   - What advice would you give to your kids
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:36.460]   on how to live--
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:37.300]   - Travel the world.
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:39.100]   - A life they can be proud of.
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:39.940]   Travel the world?
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:40.820]   - Travel the world.
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:44.100]   Get rid of friends who don't push you up
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:47.420]   and don't celebrate your success.
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:49.140]   It's hard to give that advice to young children,
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:50.740]   'cause kids are always so catty.
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:55.420]   But honestly, it's like, when I see,
[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:57.780]   that really is, I just think, not just advice to my kids,
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:59.420]   but some of the best advice to anybody.
[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:02.380]   If you've got anyone around you
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:04.340]   who doesn't celebrate your success,
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:07.560]   just spend less time with those people.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.620]   Surround yourself with people who actually
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:12.620]   wanna celebrate your success and push you to succeed.
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:13.620]   I think that's true.
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:15.060]   I think it's even more important at a young age,
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:18.620]   'cause if at a young age you get used to being around people
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.620]   who kinda take joy in tearing you down,
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.620]   then that's what you become accustomed to.
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:26.740]   And I just think, having friends who love you
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:30.340]   and support you is just about the closest thing
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:33.500]   to the true meaning of life.
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:36.580]   - And who believe in you, who believe in your potential.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:39.020]   And some of those ideas underlie
[02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:40.960]   the good parts of Scientology.
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.800]   - Yeah.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.960]   - Except there's a lot of dark parts of Scientology
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:48.200]   that separate you from the people that believe in you
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.140]   and that love you.
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:53.760]   Well, this was a beautiful conversation.
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:57.740]   You're a beautiful human being who came full of gifts.
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:01.760]   And I genuinely, first of all,
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.360]   you're an inspiring human being.
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:05.760]   But most importantly, I can't wait
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:09.760]   until I can purchase a bobblehead on the store.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.720]   So I can keep that inspiration on my desktop.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:15.000]   Aaron, thank you so much for talking to me.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.200]   Thank you for being you, for being brave.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.440]   I know you said you're not,
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:21.420]   but thank you for being brave, for talking about this.
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:24.280]   You're an inspiration and you help a lot of people.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.120]   Thank you, brother.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.740]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:28.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:29.460]   with Aaron Smith Levin.

[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:35.000]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.600]   from Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:40.600]   Be not the slave of your own past.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.140]   Plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep and swim far.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:47.880]   So you will come back with new self-respect,
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:51.160]   with new power and with an advanced experience
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.280]   that will explain and overlook the old.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:58.160]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.740]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:03.320]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:13.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
