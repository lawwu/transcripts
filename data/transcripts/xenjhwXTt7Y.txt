[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   The LSB is more faithful to the original languages and translates word for word according to
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.960]   authorial intent.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.480]   What the original author, who is God, and the human author, whom God inspired in the
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.820]   writing of scripture to communicate.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.760]   So the LSB has done an excellent job to clarify the original meaning of the text in our own
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.200]   English language such that we can better understand it, better understand what the original author
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.040]   wanted to communicate by it, and apply it then to our lives as believers.
