[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   April writes in to ask, "Dear Pastor John, when a Christian dies and goes to heaven in spirit,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   do they see their loved ones who are still on earth? I hear it said sometimes that they are looking down on us or watching out for us.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Is this true or is this just another happy funeral thought?" What do you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I want to say that the comforts that the Word of God gives to those of us who've lost Christian loved ones
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   are so massive and so glorious, it's a shame that anyone would resort to speculation to find comfort.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   That's what I want to say. It is speculation to wonder how much the saints in heaven know about the events on earth.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We don't know. And it's a sign of ill spiritual health when someone feels the need to know in order to be happy.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   There's no evidence that the saints in heaven serve the saints on earth.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The Roman Catholic Church is going beyond the Bible when they cultivate the practice of praying to the saints for help or for intercession.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Jesus is the one mediator between God and man.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   1 Timothy 2.5, there's one God and one mediator between God and man, the man, Christ Jesus.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So what I say to people who ask me about their loved ones in heaven is this.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Since the Bible is clear that being there is better than being here,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and being at God's right hand is fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   we can say for sure that God will give the saints whatever measure of knowledge they need for the greatest experience of happiness in God.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That's why I answer. If they need to know something here for their fullest experience of joy in God, they'll know it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I mean, he won't withhold what's needed for their happiness in him.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   If they need to be ignorant of something for the fullest experience of joy in God, he'll keep them ignorant.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   In other words, we need to trust what we're told in the Bible about the happiness of the saints in heaven.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It is glorious. It is supreme. God loves them and he's providing for them everything they need.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   But the main thing to emphasize is that all speculation about such things for the sake of strengthening our souls is a spiritual detour
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   off the main highway of God's blessing and comfort and strength and hope.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   The highway is what he has revealed in the Bible, and it is glorious beyond words.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Here's a few tastes to end with. To me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose, I cannot tell.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'm hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far and away better.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Philippians 1 or so we're always of good courage.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We know that while we are in the body, we are away from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by sight.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yes, we are of good courage and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   They're at home. Relax. They're at home. And Paul said it's far preferable.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Or Luke 20. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living for all live to him.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So they're alive and they're living to him and he is their God.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Or first Corinthians 15. Death is swallowed up in victory. Oh, death, where is your victory?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin. The power of sin is the law.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So my beloved brothers, be steadfast. Now this is this is what you need to say to these people who are all worked up about whether they're seeing us.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You be steadfast. You be immovable.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   You always abound in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   When you get there, you won't regret anything you've invested in the Lord.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Or one more. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning or crying or pain anymore for the former things have passed away.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So my response is if these solid biblical promises don't give strength and joy and solid hope to the grieving, there's a deeper problem that needs addressing.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And that problem will not be solved by speculating about the saints in heaven.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And speaking of speculation in heaven, one of the most popular episodes that we released back in March,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   we talked about the books of these near-death experiences or return from heaven stories that are so common and popular today.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   See, that episode is titled "How Real is the Book? Heaven is for Real." That's episode number 302.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   We talk about Calvinism or Reformed Theology here on the podcast a lot, and we increasingly get questions from listeners who are new to those terms.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Tomorrow, I'll ask Pastor John for a very basic definition of Calvinism or Reformed Theology.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. I'll see you back here tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   [end]
