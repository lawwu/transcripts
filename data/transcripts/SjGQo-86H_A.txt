[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.420]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs, where we give you practical insights into jobs and
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.420]   careers.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.480]   Today, we're talking about horror stories from our careers and what we've learned from
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480]   that.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.160]   Joining us is Troy Peterson and Jesse Ratner.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160]   What's up, Tim?
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160]   Hey, Tim.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   I'm good.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.660]   Now, naturally, you guys have both had your own episodes, and make sure you guys click
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.400]   on the links to watch those.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.400]   But between all of us, not to age us, we've got a fair amount of years of experience between
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   us, right?
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.560]   I think I've been doing, I think, 24 years in industry.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.040]   How about you guys?
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.880]   Yeah, I'm at 25 years in tech, and then before that, I was in media for about four years
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.560]   after college.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:59.000]   And I'm in about the same space, actually, as you would know, when I first, almost, first
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   jobs in tech were with Troy.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.680]   Actually, that was one of my first jobs in tech, and I think you were my manager for
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   a minute.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.960]   And yes, I'm really excited to talk, and we certainly have decades of experience between
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960]   us.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.120]   Lots of horror stories, and looking forward to talking about it.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.760]   Yeah, you know, the funny thing about horror stories is we've all got them, right?
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.420]   And it can range from small or big, and it's all relative to who we are as people and how
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.920]   we digest information and deal with it.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.080]   I think what we do with it and how we respond to it is really important.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.680]   And I think early in our careers, mid and late, there's always something to take away
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   from it.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.040]   And so our goal is to share that with you guys who's listening and watching this podcast,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.040]   and hopefully you can get something out of that.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.280]   So I'm going to kick us off, you guys, and you're probably going to laugh at me, because
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   the first topic is dealing with mistakes.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.600]   Have you guys ever sent a nasty email to someone and you forgot to take them off CC?
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.040]   I've never done that one, no, unfortunately, but I've definitely received mistake emails
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.800]   like that.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.720]   It's the worst, you guys.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.440]   When you hit submit, you see the participants in the email quickly, and you feel this rush
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.120]   of heat and blood coming up the back of your neck, and that freakout starts to happen,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   right?
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.400]   It happened to me twice in my career.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.720]   The first one was younger, maybe like, I think, two or three years into my job experience.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.700]   And then the other one happened like, I think, within the past three years.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.240]   And I think how I dealt with it and how I process it was very different based on just
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.800]   how long I've been in the industry.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.360]   The first one was really bad.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.160]   I was on the agency side of the business.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.240]   So I was an account manager, right?
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.960]   So my whole job is to build relationships with customers and hopefully build credibility,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.360]   trust, and gain more business.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.640]   I had this one particular client who was really, really difficult, both verbally abusive to
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.960]   my team and typically, you give an inch, take a mile type of stuff, right?
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.600]   That's interpretation from an agency side.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.720]   And at that point, I really had it.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.680]   I think I was maybe 27 years old.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.400]   And so they had sent an email to the team, which was not a nice email.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.600]   So I hit, so I did a reply all and I deleted them from the first draft of the email.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.520]   But then I didn't like the email, I closed it and I came back to it.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   The problem is when I came back to it and I redrafted it, I didn't take them off the
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   chain.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   No.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.240]   And I was literally, my choice of verbiage was like, "They're terrible," like, "I can't
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.280]   believe I have clients like this," and it was really bad and I hit send on that.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.840]   The blood rush happened.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.240]   And my response to that besides, "Oh, crap," was sending an immediate follow-up email to
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.720]   just my internal team.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.600]   I sent another email to the client and in some cases, almost overreacting on my part
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   to the mistake.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:22.400]   What I didn't do was pause, breathe, reread the email because I have more context around
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   why I said that, but the reader does not and they may not read it the same way I read it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.400]   And what ended up happening was my manager told me, "Hey, look, if you didn't respond,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.820]   I don't think they would have said anything.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.220]   But because you overly focused on it, now it's a thing and you've drawn all this attention
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   to it.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   You could just let it lie."
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.920]   And it ended up taking me off the account because it damaged reputation of our – with
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   the client.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.240]   It was really, really bad.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.440]   Three years ago, I did another one and this one was about an individual.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.040]   And similar things, we have gripes about people and they're annoying.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.520]   And so I sent out an email and this time, similarly, accidentally CC'd them.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.440]   My response this time around being older and having more gray hairs on my head was a lot
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.760]   different.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   I did the pause.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.460]   I drafted an email and then I – actually, before I hit the email, first, I erased everyone
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.140]   from the send.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.140]   So that's the new thing.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.620]   And whenever I send emails like that, I first remove everybody so there's no chance of
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.420]   accidentally something out.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.460]   So I remove them all and I allowed myself about an hour or two to go back and forth
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.740]   and read it, put in draft mode, come back, shorten it, right, shorten, shorten it.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.820]   And then I sent the response back.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.340]   And this time what I did was I went back to the individual and gave them context.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.460]   Part of it was admitting my own mistakes.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.420]   I was like, "Hey, man, that was embarrassing for me but here's what I meant to say."
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.420]   And I left it open-ended.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.600]   I said, "Hey, look, if you don't have a conversation, here's what it is.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.660]   Here's what I truly meant and some of the truth behind what I'm trying to say."
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.160]   That was a very different response.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.420]   So they came back saying, "Oh," they kind of laughed and like, "Thank you for calling
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.420]   yourself out."
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.460]   But then we got right to the heart of the issue of the concern, right?
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.100]   And so that was that horror story.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.060]   I'm glad I haven't had too many of those but I had another similar one through chat
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:34.420]   where I was talking about someone to somebody else and I was on the wrong window.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.380]   And so the message I meant to send to someone else, I sent to them directly.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.120]   It was literally, "So-and-so is so annoying.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.980]   I can't believe they said that."
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.300]   And actually, that was the midpoint of my career.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.720]   And the way I dealt with that one is kind of like the medium of the two.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.580]   I said, "Hey," I did a white lie.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.300]   I was like, "Hey, man," oh, actually, first of all, he responded, "WTF," right?
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.660]   And I said, "Hey, man, I just want to share with you what I sent to someone else because
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.660]   you know what?
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.780]   I don't think that was an appropriate thing.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.060]   I want you to know what I said because I'm trying to hold myself accountable."
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.060]   Total lie.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.100]   But ironically enough, I was able to build upon that and use make lemonade out of the
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.500]   lemons and allowed me to start having more frank conversations with this person.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   But I think they saw through it.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.740]   I don't think they're that dumb, but that was my horrible mistake.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.700]   I feel like if we were younger, Tim, you would respond with a meme this thin age, right?
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.780]   Or a GIF or something like that.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.780]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.780]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.700]   I don't think us old fogeys have those skills to respond in that way today, but what about
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.700]   you, Jesse?
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.140]   Have you had a nightmare like that?
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.140]   I've had a few.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:00.740]   And, you know, I was thinking when you were telling the story, the second one, Tim, that
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.180]   sometimes fear is such a funny thing.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.420]   Some of it is sort of like a biological response.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.940]   You hear a loud noise and you're on the street and there's a backfire or something, you jump
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.620]   and you're like, "What the hell is that?"
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.660]   And some fears are more learned.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.220]   Like the fear of public speaking, I think is maybe it's a little bit of both, but you
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.900]   can unlearn it and become a good, confident public speaker, even though it's probably
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.620]   one of the scariest things for most people to do.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.220]   And some things are cultural because of the culture you're in.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.380]   And, you know, in some cases, I think I've been on team cultures and corporate cultures
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.580]   even where I might have said to somebody, you know, in error, "Oh, you're so annoying."
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.660]   But the culture is a culture of forgiveness, of kindness, of understanding, and you could
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.660]   just talk about things.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.700]   And I actually was on the receiving end of one of those texts from a designer.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.260]   He actually, I sat, I had a standing desk and I sat or I stood on one side and he stood
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.980]   on the other.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.660]   And I think he didn't mean to send a text that basically said, "That guy, Jesse, is
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.660]   a real jerk."
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.580]   And I looked over at him and I'm like, "I don't think you meant that for me."
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.940]   And I didn't take it that badly, I just, he's a young guy.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:25.060]   He was also a guy who had been, he was very junior, but sort of like this was his first
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.340]   job out of design school.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.300]   And after about a year, he started asking to get promoted.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.300]   He was a junior designer.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.300]   He started getting asked to be promoted to creative director every week.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.220]   Every week he'd come in and talk about how he needed to be, I was managing him and he
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.620]   said, "I need to be promoted or I'm going to leave."
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:50.140]   And then after a little while he left, so good for him, but I've been on a, not so much,
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.420]   I've sent a few nasty grams and had to clean up things afterwards.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:01.220]   But I think in terms of biggest mistakes or big mistakes, certainly I have one that really
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:08.460]   stands out and I was working at an agency where I had been in a sort of a managerial
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:14.380]   role, a lead role, but I was sort of under somebody that I couldn't move up.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.220]   And I was on this same account for a long time, it was a big account, we had Google
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.020]   as a client.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.940]   And so we had, it had been years, right?
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.980]   I had done a two-year stint with one agency under the same manager and then another two-year
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.140]   stint with another agency under the same manager.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.620]   And we were very successful together, we worked pretty well together, we ended up starting
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.060]   an agency later on together.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.700]   But at some point, and the agency had grown from like a very small size to many hundreds
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:54.900]   of people, we had weekly happy hours at this restaurant in San Francisco on the Embarcadero
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.660]   right under the Bay Bridge, it was beautiful.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.500]   And so we'd go over there with the Googlers and hang out and talk about business, talk
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:07.940]   about other stuff, it was very casual, we'd drink quite often, as you might imagine.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.820]   And one night I was really chafing under this, there's a lot of things going on in my life,
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:18.100]   I was trying to buy a house, I had a young child, my wife and I have, still do, but our
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.060]   child was very young then.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:28.220]   And I had a couple drinks, let's say three or four, dark and stormies, and I went up
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:38.340]   to the boss above my manager, oh, and by the way, I had been moonlighting for a client
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:44.580]   that the agency subsequently gained as their client, which I then dropped.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.340]   But I felt like, well, once the agency gained this client and I learned that they had been
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.660]   struggling a bit with the creative, and I thought to myself, well, this is a great opportunity
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.580]   for me, I could say, hey, I actually know this brand, in and out, I can help you, blah,
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.580]   blah, blah.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.260]   You know, and I've been thinking about it for months, like, how do I make my move, when's
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.780]   the right time, what's the right way to do it?
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:12.500]   Anyway, so this Friday happened, and like I said, I had a couple drinks, and I pulled
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.660]   the boss's boss aside, and I said, I can help you, here's why, I actually know this client
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.180]   and I've been working for them on the side, and he was like, wait a second, timeout, timeout,
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.700]   that's probably a conflict of interest, I need to talk to the partners, and soon after
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.780]   that I got pushed out of the agency.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.900]   You know, I was on a really good path, I was on a good path, had a strong, well, at least,
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:43.100]   I would have probably continued in that sort of corporate agency path, and it completely
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.140]   changed the trajectory of my career, and I've been a consultant ever since, and in some
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:54.260]   ways it's been really good, you know, I took a risk, but it wasn't well thought out, and
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:59.420]   I think I was going to be stuck in a role that I didn't feel satisfied with, if I didn't
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.420]   somehow make a move, and I might have made the wrong move at the wrong time, but the
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.700]   result was it opened a bunch of doors, because I had to, then I had to hustle, I lost my
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.540]   job, I got another job right away, I had a good, you know, good resume, having worked
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.740]   at a big brand, or at an agency for a big brand, and some of the things, and, you know,
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.220]   other doors open, and I, you know, I can, some of the other things I think we'll talk
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.060]   about in terms of fear of, you know, fear of fear itself, fear of failure, those kind
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.460]   of things, came to the forefront as I then moved down the road in my journey, but yeah,
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:37.540]   it wasn't a mistake, probably, you know, the timing, not so good, the inebriation part
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:44.140]   probably not so helpful in my decision-making at the time, and I think I, you know, I held
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.020]   that inside for a long time, and I saw the guy at the boss's boss, I hadn't seen him,
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.140]   yeah, I hadn't talked to him, like, I was somewhat of a friend, I mean, he'd kind of
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.860]   been to my house, and I'd been to his house, and, you know, we knew each other quite well,
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.220]   worked close together, the boss's boss, that is, and then I didn't see him for like seven
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:09.460]   years, you know, I got pushed out, I remember that last day, he walked me to the door and
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:17.940]   like that was it, and I saw him like about six months ago, it had been like seven years,
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:25.100]   and I was getting a test for CPAP machine, I took a sleep disorder test, and I go to
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:31.340]   leave from the from picking up the instructions, and the elevator door opens, this is a hospital,
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.540]   you know, upstairs, and the door opens, and there he is, and he walks out, and we shake
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.060]   hands and sit, I sit down for him, with him for a few minutes, and it was weird, because
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:48.460]   I still was kind of looking for him to acknowledge what had happened, and he didn't, and he texted
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.900]   me or I texted him or something, we had like a very short text communication, and then
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.820]   nothing really, you know, we're not really friends anymore, but yeah, really, it really
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:05.300]   was a probably not such a good move on my part, sorry about that, but it happens, right,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:11.780]   and then you move on, because you have to, and I'm gonna put myself on mute for a second,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.320]   so Troy can maybe share about a couple of things, but that's probably the biggest mistake
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.220]   that wasn't a mistake, but was a mistake type experience.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:26.220]   Yeah, I kind of actually wonder, you know, we always have stuff to bring to the table,
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.700]   and I wonder if you hadn't brought up the fact that you're moonlighting, and you're
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:38.140]   just like, hey, I have some insights, or maybe I know this company, and maybe this nugget
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.220]   would help you, do you think that would change it, because now you're, again, you're trying
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.900]   to position yourself in a company, and I think this happens all the time, right, like we
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.340]   have connections, relationships, and some stuff might better position us, right, is
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.940]   there a way that could have played out differently, do you think, or just in general, just having
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:59.540]   a relationship was gonna doom you by whatever information you're about to disclose?
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.900]   I think I definitely could have positioned it better, I didn't need to, you know, talk
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.660]   about how I came by that experience, I just could convey that I had a, you know, a deep
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.660]   appreciation, it actually was LinkedIn, oddly enough, that was the client that I knew about,
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.660]   that had worked for, on the side, and yeah, I could have positioned it as I had this experience,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.820]   I understand the brand, I know their voice, I know their goals, I know their, you know,
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.380]   the core value props, and I think I could help, and leave it at that, I didn't necessarily
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:35.060]   need to go on how I came by that information, experience, and the problem was that I was
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.820]   a little bit drunk, and you don't think straight, and if there's any lesson I could take away
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:46.140]   from that is, you know, don't get drunk and ask questions that could change the trajectory
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.100]   of your career, you might not, you might not know where you're going the next day, and
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.180]   it's risky, it's highly risky, and it's probably one reason why, especially in agency life,
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.540]   and you're probably familiar with this, Tim, it's often the case that you're smoothing
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.980]   with clients, and there's alcohol involved, or other things, and you know, sometimes it
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.700]   doesn't always go in a straight line, and I think that's life, right, and in some ways
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:18.380]   fear is that accelerant, you know, it can accelerate us down a path that maybe we are
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.180]   trying not to face, and so maybe this was a point in my life where I was sort of admitted
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.900]   at crossroads for a long time, and I was sort of stuck in a role, I had all this experience,
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.940]   I had led large teams, like the designer who told me I was a jerk, and things like that,
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:40.420]   and had a bunch of success, and when then I was later able to go out on my own, just,
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.820]   just enumerating the things that I had done often got me into the door when I started
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.140]   my agency for conversations with potential clients, and even now I think, I still, you
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.420]   know, I didn't lose all that experience, it just, I don't necessarily lead with that story
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:01.860]   when I'm in an interview, but yeah, but to your point, I think, I think framing it certainly
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.740]   is important, when you're in a situation where you're about to make a mistake, maybe step
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.220]   back and write down a script for yourself, this is what I think I ought to communicate,
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:17.380]   you know, and maybe sleep on it, you know, or show it to a trusted person, your spouse
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:24.000]   or friend, colleague, yeah.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.580]   That's interesting to hear you guys tell these stories, I feel like there's almost like two
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:37.000]   layers of learning, there's the sort of short-term, and I think it's really important to short-term
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.220]   sort of react in a way that is productive, but then there's also like the longer term,
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.480]   like in terms of, you know, how do you deal with mistakes, you, whether you realize it
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.860]   or not, when you make mistakes, you're learning, and even if you can't articulate what the
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.820]   learning is, the next time I think you're faced with a situation that rings familiar,
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.100]   I think you're going to be better suited to respond to it appropriately.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:15.980]   So like, you know, my example is much more tactical, but it was an important thing for
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:21.840]   me to learn about how to take responsibility for it.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.180]   In the short term, I had started working for a software as a service company, my first
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:35.740]   job that was like fully digital related is sort of around the 2000 time, 2010 timeframe,
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:42.460]   and I was in charge of the CRM or slash email marketing at the time, and in one of the first
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:53.460]   big email sends that we were, that I was responsible for, went out with the big call to action,
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.940]   we forgot to put the link in for it.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.980]   So it was like, I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was like, you know, sign up
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980]   here.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.980]   And there was no, it went nowhere.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.980]   It was dead.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   It was dead link.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.780]   And dead for the context that it was kind of a nightmare job for me in a lot of ways.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:19.060]   We might get into this later, but my boss was the temporary CEO because my other boss
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:24.060]   had been removed and he hated email.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.660]   He like just didn't like the whole practice of it.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.980]   But we also knew that email marketing and a lot of marketers know this, like it's one
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:37.140]   of the, to your own, owned lists are one of the most high ROI tactics going and that still
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.220]   stands today, I believe.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.340]   So, you know, we weren't going to stop doing email, but the fact that this went out on
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:49.300]   my watch and I was reporting to a CEO that hated email.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.140]   And I was, I was devastated because like, you know, the very concept that I could make
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:59.780]   a mistake in front of, you know, thousands of people, you know, it was, it was, it was
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.780]   kind of devastating to me.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.180]   I took it really hard.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:08.900]   But in the moment, I also, I was able to at least like quickly take responsibility.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:15.980]   And I knew that this, the news, the acting CEO was sort of a very matter of fact guy.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.340]   So like we quickly built sort of the mitigation plan, which was, you know, we're going to
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.380]   re we're going to send another email, apologize and, and include the link.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.140]   Which it was very embarrassing, but you know, we, I approached him, I said, I'm really sorry
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.660]   we made this mistake and had a verbal conversation with him.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.820]   I think it was the other thing that, you know, I think we've all had moments in our careers
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:44.380]   where we follow up with a, with an email, we maybe send another follow up email.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.340]   It's like this is it swingers, the movie where the guy keeps, you know, leaving voicemails
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.420]   for the girl he likes, and it just makes makes things worse, right?
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:57.260]   It's like, it's better if you can just have like a quick conversation and attack the problem
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.380]   in the moment.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:05.380]   Yeah, I think having a mitigation plan, or immediately building one as response to it
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.380]   is really, really important.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:13.980]   You know, I think in that moment, especially with stakeholders who are watching your response
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.180]   to that, and how you're going to fix it in the plan, that's important to maintaining
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.060]   and building on credibility, because your point, mistakes happen.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:28.580]   The difference is the person who is proactive and takes initiative.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.720]   The brand you're building for yourself is one of responsibility, right?
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.460]   As opposed to, oh, you know what, I can't trust this person anymore, because they make
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.860]   a mistake, they just go off the rails, and they just lose their marbles.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:48.180]   And I think you're, I've had a few emails go out as well, from like a nurture blast
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:54.620]   or whatnot that had broken links or a website, since that's my domain, and we published wrong
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.300]   information and analysts are seeing it right away.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.260]   And there's varying degrees of how apologetic you should be, right?
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:08.640]   Because again, if you're too apologetic, sometimes you're going to blow something out of proportion.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.460]   And so being like, as we think about this way, like we've also received stuff before
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.220]   as well, right?
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:22.460]   And under construction, or hey, here's an updated link or whatever, that doesn't scream,
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.460]   I made a mistake.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.820]   It just tactically tells me as a consumer, oh, here's another link, I'll just do this
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.980]   one here.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.540]   That feels less like a mistake.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.540]   But then again, you're totally right.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.620]   There's sometimes where you just need to call it out.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.180]   And sometimes that actually helps build credibility and relationships with your customers.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.800]   But yeah, that's a great story.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.020]   I have a sort of related, I wasn't responsible necessarily for this, but I worked on a team
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.640]   that sent out an email that had a broken link.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.020]   And we followed up with the email with just a very short subject line, oops, and it was
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:03.140]   the best performing email of the whole year, just an engaging subject line.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:09.000]   I hate the fact that people actually, I think we've all received now purposeful mistakes
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.740]   for that reason, right?
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:21.160]   It's the digital marketing sometimes, marketing in general, I think we often end up doing
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.140]   some things that feels a little uncomfortable, right?
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.140]   It's a little cringy.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.580]   I mean, I wouldn't necessarily call it clickbait because it was going to a friendly list, but
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.580]   a little bit odd.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.220]   No, I mean, I'm saying that what's cringy to me is the people that do it on purpose
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.220]   to get clicks.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.300]   Oops, we made a mistake and then draws attention to it.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.660]   I think responding to a genuine mistake is authentic, right?
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:54.000]   And then there's a difference, although sometimes the reader can't tell the difference.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   But things like emails, your internal stakeholders, they think in terms of metrics, right?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.800]   And so having a mitigation plan and then doing something like, "Hey, here are the total amount
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:14.160]   of sends and here's the amount of opens," because maybe the open rate, because you caught
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.440]   it so quickly, was really, really small.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.080]   And so the impact of the mistake may not be that huge, right?
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.160]   If you don't provide context to people, then they just assume the worst.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:29.880]   So I think control the narrative as often as you can, and data is your best friend.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.920]   Our CEO at the time was huge into data, so I remember him showing him the, we showed
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.560]   him the open rate, the click rate, and also the, yeah, I think even more important, the
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.560]   unsubscribe rate.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   Yes.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.640]   And it was definitely within the normal range for any email.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:54.540]   It wasn't like a, yeah, it didn't, we didn't spur a huge loss in subscribers to the newsletter.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.760]   And I think for digital, it's an easy, well, not easy, but you can clean up a mistake.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.560]   If you put out something that has bad message, typo, whatever, missing link, you can update
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.760]   it, send out a note, or if it's a webpage, you just update it.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.240]   I recently took a picture, this is a sort of a humorous aside, but I think it's relevant.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:21.280]   So this is a, in downtown, in North Beach, in San Francisco, there's an area of town
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.880]   that has a number of strip clubs, and these strip clubs often have these big neon signs
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880]   out front.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   And so there's two of them.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.040]   I took a picture of next to each other that used the apostrophe, and one used it correctly,
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.800]   and one used it incorrectly.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:43.040]   One was Big Al's, A-L apostrophe S. The other was Roaring 20's, two, zero, apostrophe S.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.600]   The damn grocer's apostrophe.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:50.140]   Well, you know which business went out of, which strip club went out of business, Roaring
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   20's.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:57.160]   Now they met, I mean, it's sort of a humorous example, and they were around for decades,
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.360]   but you know, and they didn't feel the need to change it, I guess, or didn't know.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.280]   They just made this giant sign with the grocer's apostrophe and left it up there for decades.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:13.040]   And yeah, the beauty of digital, so quite different than brick and mortar.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.840]   Hey guys, thanks again for watching and listening.
