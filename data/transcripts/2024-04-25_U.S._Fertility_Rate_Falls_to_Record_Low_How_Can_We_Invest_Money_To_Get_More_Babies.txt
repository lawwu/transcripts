[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.920]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.000]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.600]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.160]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.040]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.920]   I am your host.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.640]   Today, we begin with an article from Today
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.680]   in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.240]   Dateline is April 25, 2024.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.960]   US fertility rate falls to record low.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.680]   Fewer babies were born in the United States in 2023
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.920]   than any year since 1979.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.640]   Here's the first paragraph or two.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.040]   American women are giving birth at record low rates.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.840]   The total fertility rate fell to 1.62 births per woman
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.320]   in 2023, a 2% decline from a year earlier.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200]   Federal data released Thursday showed.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.600]   It is the lowest rate recorded
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.160]   since the government began tracking it in the 1930s.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.920]   The decline reflects a continuing trend
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.760]   as American women navigate economic and social challenges
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.960]   that have prompted some to forego
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.240]   or delay having children.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.160]   A confluence of factors are at play.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   American women are having fewer children later in life.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.040]   Women are establishing fulfilling careers
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.240]   and have more access to contraception.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.680]   At the same time, young people are also more uncertain
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.280]   about their futures and spending more of their income
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.720]   on home ownership, student debt, and childcare.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.600]   Some women who wait to have children might have fewer
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.160]   than they would have otherwise for reasons
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.200]   including declining fertility.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.680]   The actual total number of babies was in 2023,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560]   the United States tracked and registered
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   3,591,328 births.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.360]   That is 2.1% fewer than in 2022.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.680]   And the total fertility rate has declined
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   to 1.62 children per woman,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   down from 1.66 in 2022.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.720]   Now, if this is your first time thinking
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.200]   and talking about fertility rates, then welcome.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.640]   Welcome to the conversation.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   This conversation is one of the most neglected
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.880]   in our society, and yet it probably won't stay that way
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.960]   for very long because this is the issue
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.800]   that is going to be making the biggest macro impact
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.240]   in our lives over the coming decades.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.520]   The statistics and the data are really, really bad.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.040]   And I want to take just a couple of minutes
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.640]   and talk to you about this.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.920]   I've been talking about this
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.000]   on Radical Personal Finance for a few years,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.760]   but it's been my experience that most people, even today,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.880]   have no idea how bad things are
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.920]   and how bad things could get.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   Put simply, we today, all around the world,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.520]   are below replacement rates,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.320]   with the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.240]   and in many of our societies,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.320]   substantially below replacement rates.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.720]   And the reality is, simply, we don't have any idea
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.280]   how low these rates can go.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.560]   In every place that we have data,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.600]   there is not yet a bottom.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.760]   There may be, someday, an actual bottom to the data.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.920]   I hope so.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.960]   But the reality is, right now,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.240]   in wealthy industrial countries all around the world,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.160]   we do not know where the bottom is.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.280]   Total fertility rates can be as low as,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   in Seoul, South Korea,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.000]   there's something like 0.54 babies per woman.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.880]   Now, let's put this into actual data,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.160]   or actual statistics that you can see with your eyes,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.600]   and then I want to scare you just a little bit
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   with the trend line that we are on.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.520]   First, demographers, most of us have heard
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.320]   that you need an average of about 2.1 babies per woman
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.400]   in order to have a steady, stable population.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.640]   The 2.1 basically involves a man and a woman
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.240]   replacing themselves with about a 0.1%,
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.320]   not percent, but 2.1 relates to the margin of error
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.280]   for loss of life early in childhood,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.200]   babies lost, things like that.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   So you need 2.1 babies per woman.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.960]   Let's make it simpler and say it's two babies per woman,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.840]   just simply to replace ourselves as a population.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.240]   I want you now to stop
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.880]   and to think about your reference group,
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.960]   the peers that you have,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.800]   the community that you're involved in,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.080]   co-workers, neighbors, friends, social groups,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.800]   community groups that you're a part of,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.120]   your church, your local parent-teacher association,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.520]   whatever it is that you're involved in.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.600]   I want you to think about every woman that you know.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.120]   In order for the population of your peer group to be steady,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.240]   every single woman that you know has to have
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.400]   at least two children.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.360]   Every woman you know has to have at least two children
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.840]   to maintain population.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.720]   Now, many of us know many people who don't have two children,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.360]   who have fewer or none at all.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.160]   So for every woman you know who has one child
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.800]   throughout her lifetime,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.480]   you should know another woman who has three
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.040]   to match them up.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.520]   For every woman you know who has zero children,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.360]   you should know at least one other woman
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.560]   who has four or more.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.360]   And I think if you'll stop and you'll think about
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.160]   your family, your extended family, people that you know,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.560]   you'll quickly realize that your community
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.960]   is probably below replacement rate,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.680]   and in some cases, substantially below.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.720]   Because when we think about the women that we know,
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.160]   for most of us, the averages are substantially below that.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   Now, here's what's even more scary.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.120]   The rate of decline of these fertility rates
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.840]   doesn't have currently a bottom.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.120]   I heard an analyst the other day give this statistic.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.640]   He said, if you look at the rate of fertility decline
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   in the United States between the year 2010 and 2020,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.400]   and you extrapolate or project that rate of decline
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.480]   continuing going forward,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.600]   and if you assume that there's one generation
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   every 30 years, what that means is that in the future,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.080]   under those assumptions, for every 100 Americans
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.280]   that are alive today,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   you would have 4.3 great-grandchildren.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.400]   So a population of 100 Americans who are alive today
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.360]   will have 4.3 great-grandchildren
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   if our society-wide population decline continues.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.520]   Most people are unaware of the fact
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.660]   that virtually all of the world,
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.280]   for example, all of the Americas,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.320]   North America, Central America, South America,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   the Caribbean, all of the Americas
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.160]   are under replacement rate.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.960]   Most of the big countries of the world,
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.480]   China, far below replacement rate.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.440]   India, now below replacement rate.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   Basically, the countries that are at or above
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   replacement rate are pretty much all found
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.840]   in Sub-Saharan Africa.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.800]   All of the rest of our societies are all in decline,
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   and the rate of decline is varying.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.080]   The worst rates of decline are centralized on megacities,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.200]   especially megacities in Asia.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.840]   Like I said, I think that in the last year,
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.920]   the South Korean total fertility rate for the city of Seoul,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.240]   not for all of Korea, but for the city of Seoul,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.400]   which is, of course, the largest city,
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.000]   was a double-digit decline year over year
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   to something like a 0.54 total fertility rate.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.520]   This is going to be the issue for the coming decades.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.780]   It's going to affect every area of your life and my life,
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.560]   all of our governmental systems,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.120]   all of our welfare state systems,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.240]   all of our economic growth projections.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.640]   It's all going to be driven by demographics.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.120]   And while we don't know what that's gonna look like,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.280]   'cause after all, the numbers could change,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.200]   the reality is that we don't see
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.160]   any evidence of them changing yet.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.280]   The problem is most people are not clued into this
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.120]   for two reasons.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.840]   Number one, there's been a strong campaign
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.240]   for at least 50 years, a strong propaganda campaign
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   that has been almost entirely anti-natal, anti-children.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.600]   The most famous, of course, was Paul Ehrlich's book,
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.820]   "The Population Bomb," in which he predicted global famine
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.040]   and disease and poverty due to too many people.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   And that's become basically the zeitgeist of our time,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.000]   that idea that the world has too many people
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.120]   and it's gotta change.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.400]   Most people are decades behind the demographic reality
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.800]   that we're living in today.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.000]   And it's understandable, however,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.240]   why they are, because while birth rates are low
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.920]   and heading lower all around the world,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.340]   total population is high and continuing to increase
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.080]   for, I think, about a decade at least.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   The problem is that that increase in population size
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.760]   on a global basis is not coming from the fact
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.300]   that we're having more babies.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.940]   On the contrary, it's due to extending lifespans
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.120]   for old people.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   And so our world is getting bigger and bigger
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.520]   in terms of population with more and more old people,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.760]   but we're not having babies.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.600]   And here's the problem.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.560]   We've been not having babies for a very long time.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.340]   And so not only in many countries
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.560]   do we not have babies today,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.280]   we don't have even enough women of baby-bearing age
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.680]   to have babies.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.080]   And we don't have enough children, enough young girls,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.320]   teenage girls, who are going to be able to even have babies
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.880]   to replace ourselves in most cases.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.480]   And so many countries of the world
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.280]   are already in a demographic winter
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.040]   and there's no solution apparent for it.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.200]   Governments all around the world
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.280]   are trying solutions of various kinds
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.160]   to try to stem the tide and change the numbers,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.400]   but so far there is not a single sustained
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.300]   and enduring success story that we can point to
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.320]   of a wealthy industrialized country
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.640]   being able to change demographics.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.480]   I'd like to do my best to start a conversation
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.400]   here at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.040]   And while it's unlikely that you or I
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.840]   can change the demographics of our country,
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.800]   probably or possibly we can start to change
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.280]   the demographics of our community.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.800]   And perhaps we can have some rippling influence
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.840]   that would result in us having more babies
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.960]   within our own communities, within our own societies.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.040]   At the very least,
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.680]   I hope that we can make this change within our own families,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.640]   within our own children, grandchildren,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.080]   and on down the road.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.360]   And I wanna talk today about how we can invest money
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.280]   into making that happen.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.400]   There's tremendous paradox with regard to money.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.520]   The reality is most of us don't value money itself,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.360]   but what we value is what money is good for,
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.700]   what money can buy for us.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.680]   The problem is that money itself
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.120]   is what is easily measured.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.800]   Because money is expressed in financial terms
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.240]   and we have a clear understanding of how much we have,
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.580]   what the current amount of it is,
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.380]   then we can manage it very effectively.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.900]   Peter Drucker famously said
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.280]   that what gets measured gets managed.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.640]   And I think that's true, what gets measured gets managed.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.940]   And we live in today in a modern world
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.080]   in which we can measure money and wealth
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.280]   very, very effectively,
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.720]   more effectively than at any time in human history.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.960]   Go back 500 years and imagine you're some great,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.800]   wealthy Lord of the manor, wealthy Lord of the estate.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.000]   You've got a great castle, you've got lands,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.500]   you've got all of this wealth.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.720]   Would you be able to actually measure your wealth?
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.440]   If we could just judge by Jane Austen's writings
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.720]   more recently than 500 years ago,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.060]   about the best that a man could do to measure his wealth
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.820]   would be to measure his income,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.140]   how much income his estate could provide for him.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.100]   And that's a useful measurement because income is spendable.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.280]   But the actual value of the estate, the net worth,
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.700]   what we today in accounting terms
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.340]   would call a man's net worth, was very hard to measure.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.300]   You couldn't do back then what you can do today
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.500]   with your fancy estate and go on Zillow and get a Zestimate
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.820]   telling you with pretty decent accuracy what it's worth,
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.860]   what you could sell it for today.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.620]   You couldn't have all of your investments
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.420]   and all of your companies marked to the market
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.520]   with a specific monetary value on a daily basis.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.900]   Back then you just had a rough estimate of,
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.380]   am I wealthy or not?
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.820]   Today, we can know the exact dollar figure
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.740]   that represents wealth.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.400]   The problem is, is that the only thing that matters?
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.380]   It's pretty obvious that the goal of a man's life
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.460]   should not be when he lays his head in his casket
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.500]   to have the most zeros behind his net worth figure
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.340]   that his accountant draws up for his final tax returns.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.640]   That's a pretty stupid measurement of a life.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   But because it's easily measurable,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.220]   that's what we tend to optimize for.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.920]   I have a personal hobby of trying to come up
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.460]   with other forms of optimization,
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.940]   other things that we could measure
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.240]   that would indicate more useful metrics
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.160]   of life satisfaction, some version of a happiness score.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.800]   Now you might do that on a daily basis
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.480]   by tracking your emotions with some app.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.820]   You might do that by tracking the number of minutes
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.620]   that you spend in leisure time,
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.000]   or the number of books that you read,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.880]   or the number of widgets that you produce
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.360]   with your hobby of making stuff,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.720]   the number of dates that you go on with your spouse,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.000]   or the hours that you visit with your parents,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.800]   or the number of children's games that you attend.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.000]   One of my personal metrics
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.200]   that is kind of interesting and informal
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.280]   is I optimize for the fatness
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.120]   of my children's annual photo books.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.960]   My wife makes for each of our children each year
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.760]   a photo book containing basically the adventures
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.840]   that that child has gone through
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.720]   in this year with our family.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.280]   The interesting thing about taking pictures
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.060]   is that ordinarily we don't take pictures
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.200]   of the day-to-day commonplace happenings of our life,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.080]   the humdrum events of life.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.220]   I didn't walk into the office today
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.120]   and take a picture of my microphone as I began a podcast.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.160]   But we take pictures of things
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.840]   that are out of the ordinary.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   So they don't have to be too out of the ordinary.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.240]   I might just go to the park and buy a kite today
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.940]   and take my children to the park and fly a kite,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.280]   but that's worthy of taking pictures.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.320]   That's a moment that can be captured in time,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.720]   and it's worthy of taking pictures.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.520]   So what we do is we get all of our pictures together
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.720]   from the year, and then each year my wife makes a photo book.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.400]   And some photo books are rather slender and lean.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.560]   Some photo books are rather fat.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.880]   And I like the fat ones because it tells me,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.360]   hey, there was enough texture and variety in this past year
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.320]   to make for a really interesting photo book for my children.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.720]   And it's my hope that with those nice fat books,
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.280]   they'll have more pictures that they can go back
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.000]   and look at and enjoy and appreciate and recognize that,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.980]   hey, this was a really great adventurous year
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.280]   that I had with my family.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.560]   But that's not the only metric
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.700]   that perhaps we should consider.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.360]   There are many others.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   Here's one I would like to offer
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.080]   that I think is a reasonable metric
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.000]   by which to judge your success.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.380]   Not for everybody, but it's a reasonable one.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.560]   How many great-grandchildren will you have?
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.480]   - I wanted to make sure my kids were ready
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.340]   for the new school year and felt confident in class.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.400]   That's why we joined IXL,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.520]   the award-winning online learning program
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.160]   so many other parents recommended to us.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.520]   On IXL, my kids can practice
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.280]   everything they're learning in school,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   including math, language arts, science, and more.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.200]   They get detailed explanations of every concept,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.760]   plus positive feedback and motivating awards
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.160]   as they master new challenges.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.460]   As a parent, I am amazed by how IXL always adjusts
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.640]   to the right level of difficulty for each of my kids.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.960]   It even recommends specific skills for them to practice,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.240]   helping them build the foundations they need
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.280]   and get ahead when they're ready.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.960]   And with the IXL app,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.520]   my kids can keep learning on any device,
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.560]   anytime, anywhere.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.800]   If you're looking for a fun and effective way
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.920]   to give your kids a little extra boost this school year,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.240]   you have to join IXL.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.340]   Visit ixl.com today to get started.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.520]   - Have you ever thought about it?
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.040]   How many great-grandchildren will you have?
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.440]   Now, chances are decent
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.680]   that you probably will never meet them all.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.360]   But ideally, throughout your life,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.040]   you should see some indications
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.560]   of the trajectory that you're on.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.580]   And I think that's a pretty interesting metric
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.760]   for us to consider.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.680]   How many great-grandchildren
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.240]   you have
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.200]   is a reasonable life goal.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.160]   And what I like about this life goal
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.280]   is it's a very positive life goal
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.320]   that cannot be coerced.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.960]   I don't like goals of coercion.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.800]   I don't like things that you can force people to do
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   'cause you can bend the world to you in some way.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.400]   I like goals that require you to grow as an individual,
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.440]   me to grow as an individual.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.600]   And if I desire to have a significant number
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.840]   of great-grandchildren who have issued from my loins,
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.520]   then I need to be the kind of guy
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.800]   who builds a family culture
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.180]   and where that is possible.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.680]   After all,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.520]   I can't
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.840]   coerce the number of children
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.080]   that I have.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.460]   I could do my best to plan for them,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.720]   but I can't force it.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.120]   Some events of having children are outside of my hands,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.720]   outside of your hands, no matter who we are.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.480]   But let's assume that I am able to have children.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.080]   If I'm able to have children,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.600]   I can't coerce my children to have children.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.660]   I have to inspire them to have children.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.400]   And even if I could coerce my wife to have children,
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.480]   which I can't,
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.960]   and even if I could coerce my children to have children,
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.000]   which I can't,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.980]   I certainly could not coerce my grandchildren
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.040]   to have children.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.960]   But what I can do is I can focus on investing into my family,
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.240]   inspiring and encouraging and leading my wife,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   inspiring my children,
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.400]   giving them a vision and facilitating their family formation
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.760]   and then building a culture
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.000]   that ideally would pass down through the ages
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.520]   where my children would go beyond me
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.100]   and their children beyond them and so on down through the ages
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.080]   to the level of my great-grandchildren.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.880]   And I would have to do with all of that
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.140]   by inspiration and leadership
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.920]   rather than by coercion or manipulation.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.480]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.960]   If you put numbers to this,
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.640]   then it can make it measurable.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.600]   And I don't know that this is a great thing
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.480]   to put numbers to,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.840]   but it's interesting to put numbers to non-financial goals
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.360]   and see how the math works out.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.880]   So let's assume that a guy like me,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.120]   let's assume that I have an ambition
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.920]   to have 100 great-grandchildren.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.540]   Round number, 100 sounds like a lot to me.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.440]   What would be necessary for me
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.840]   to have 100 great-grandchildren?
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.760]   Well, at the moment I have five children.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.380]   Now, I can calculate the total fertility rate
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.960]   that would be needed in my own family
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.640]   in order for me to have that number of great-grandchildren.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.120]   It's pretty simple to calculate.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.320]   And I've done the math.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.680]   I won't drag you through the whole formula for it,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   but in essence, basically it's an exponential formula
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   that starts with the current number of children that I have.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.760]   If each of my children and each of their children
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.280]   had on average 4.47 children,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   total fertility rate of 4.47 children,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.760]   then the math would work out
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.920]   that I would have 100 great-grandchildren.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.280]   I have five children.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.400]   If they averaged across those five children,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.680]   again, four and a half children each,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.320]   some have three, one has seven,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.600]   one has five, one has six, et cetera,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.220]   then it would work out to four,
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.800]   if it worked out to 4.47.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.080]   And if that continued on through my grandchildren,
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.200]   then I would have 100 great-grandchildren.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.360]   It's a rather interesting thought experiment to go through.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.200]   The interesting thing about that number
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.080]   is that I think that's a very feasible number.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.960]   I already have five children, so it's easier for me.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.120]   If I had six or seven,
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.520]   then it would be a lower number needed
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.960]   to arrive at that 100 mark.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.640]   But the most important thing would be
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.280]   how could I help my children to have enough children?
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.740]   By the way, in today's world,
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.000]   this goal is, I've never heard a motivational speaker
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.720]   say that this is a goal that anybody should set.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.920]   I've listened to a lot of motivational speakers.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.760]   I've read a lot of books
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.240]   where people talked about net worth goals
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.760]   and things that you should be focusing on
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.800]   in terms of your net worth
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.520]   and how much money you need for retirement.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.360]   I've never heard somebody say,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.400]   you should have a goal for how many grandchildren you have
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.480]   or how many great-grandchildren you have.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.660]   But although this is unusual in today's world,
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.720]   I don't believe that it's unusual throughout human history.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.440]   If you go and you spend time reading through ancient texts,
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.520]   you will find that the ambition
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.220]   that many men and women had was to have many descendants.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.500]   The wealthiest and most powerful throughout human history
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.680]   have often had many descendants.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.860]   And the promise of having many descendants
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.820]   was an inspiring promise
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.060]   for many men of renown throughout history.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.420]   I don't have the pride and arrogance
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.020]   to somehow believe that the last century
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.860]   that has indoctrinated you and me with an antinatal mindset
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.820]   should somehow be more important
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.700]   than the multiple millennia
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.420]   of which we have recorded human history
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.060]   that has a different mindset.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.860]   And I would encourage you to think about your goals
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.540]   and recognize that there's wisdom
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.700]   in the ambitions of our forebears.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.720]   So consider it.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   What's so interesting also, quick note on this,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.060]   'cause I did the calculations, I thought it'd be fun.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.740]   What's interesting is, with every,
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.260]   because fecundity or total fertility rate
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.700]   is something that can be changed
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.480]   and is an exponential factor,
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.520]   the numbers can change massively with just a small amount.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.220]   I should spend probably another 30 minutes
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.940]   scaring you with the statistics on the negative side.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.480]   I'm choosing not to do that,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.040]   but there are resources you can go and look for
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.380]   that would shock you
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.120]   with how scary this population decline is.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.420]   I don't like to use the word collapse,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.260]   generally speaking,
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.420]   because it's a word that's fraught with emotion.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.800]   However, this is an area in which it is proper
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.200]   to talk about population collapse.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.540]   I often wanna be a little bit more soft-spoken in my words
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.340]   and I talk about population decline,
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.420]   but it's proper to use the word collapse in this
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.520]   because the exponential effects of population growth
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.680]   can be amazing on the positive side
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.940]   and they can be amazing or shocking on the negative side
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.820]   with how quickly a population can absolutely collapse.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.260]   It's really remarkable.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.360]   So here are just my numbers.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.340]   So I told you I have five children,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.420]   and if I had a goal of having 100 great-grandchildren,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.860]   then that would require a total fertility rate
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.860]   of 4.47 children per child of mine
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.100]   to have 100 great-grandchildren.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.340]   Now, the reason I mentioned that number
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.540]   is that that's a significant number,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.860]   but it's not out of sight.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.380]   I'm not trying to say that somehow my children
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.540]   should have 18 children each.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.000]   The goal is not just to have as many children as possible,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.700]   but I'm the youngest of seven.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.300]   I have five children.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.020]   I don't think that 4.47
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.500]   is an unreasonable total fertility rate.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.720]   I would say that in my social circle,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.300]   having four children is pretty average.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   That there are, I know I have a handful of friends
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.500]   who have two or three.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.940]   I don't have many friends in my social circle
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.580]   who don't wind up having any,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.740]   but then I know various ones who have six or seven,
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.420]   and so four is a pretty average.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   Four is kind of the number that is the median,
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:20.500]   the most common number among people in my circle.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.580]   But here's what's interesting.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.160]   Let's assume that I wanted to have
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.560]   200 great-grandchildren.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.720]   Check this out.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.560]   Let's assume that I wanted to have
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.960]   200 great-grandchildren,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.280]   and I assumed that I could get the total fertility rate
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   of my lineage down to up to five,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.660]   an average of five across the population.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.520]   How many children would I need to have?
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.420]   The answer, by the way, is not that many.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.480]   It's eight.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.640]   If I had eight children,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.480]   and then my children went on
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.720]   to have a total fertility rate of five across,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.320]   there might be 200 great-grandchildren.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.640]   Now, if I have four, you can do the math yourself.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.860]   It's kind of fun to run the math
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.960]   and just see how small impacts,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.560]   when they're exponential, can make a difference.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.320]   But the point I was making with 4.47
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.440]   is that's about double the self-reported
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.400]   total fertility rate that women in the United States
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.920]   seem to say that they want to have.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.160]   So the number of children
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.040]   that women in the United States want to have,
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.400]   depending on the data that we look at,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.000]   is between two and three children per woman,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.280]   a total fertility rate.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.080]   That includes the people who want four, that includes zero.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.400]   But the total fertility rate that women desire to have
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.120]   on self-reported surveys seems to be between two to three.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.060]   The current total fertility rate in the United States
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   is down at that 1.62 number as of the most recent data.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.880]   So if we were to change this,
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.480]   we would have to create a different culture,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.160]   and we would have to create
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.680]   a significantly different environment,
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.440]   and we would have to solve the problems
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.340]   that are causing people to not even have the number of,
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.240]   causing women to not even have the number of children
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.260]   they say they want,
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:07.800]   or to even actually want to have more.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.040]   And I find this a fascinating thought experiment,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.840]   and I think this is, I hope this is worthy of your time.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.600]   So let's talk about the different steps
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.000]   and talk about ideas as to how we could potentially
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   invest money into your great-grandchildren.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.160]   And recognize that all of this,
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.480]   I'm repeating this for the third time,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.000]   'cause I really want you to get it clear.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.360]   All of this has to come from a positive,
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.240]   inspirational perspective of leadership.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.860]   You cannot coerce or manipulate.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.280]   Maybe you could manipulate something,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.520]   you could establish an enormous trust fund
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.240]   and require that the disbursements from the trust fund
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.640]   are based upon certain number of children.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.720]   I don't think that's smart.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.840]   I think that our, at least 80% of our focus
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.640]   should be on the positive things that we could do
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.880]   to inspire within our own family,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.400]   and then to facilitate using money
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.640]   whenever anything possible
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.060]   to help our children to have children.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.680]   So let's talk through the process
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.000]   of your great-grandchildren.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.240]   The first initial barrier for many of my listeners
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.840]   to having great-grandchildren
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.060]   is for you to find someone with whom you can procreate.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.360]   And this is astonishingly difficult today.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.240]   I grant the difficulty of this.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.460]   There are legions of young men and young women
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.000]   who desire to marry, desire to have children,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.440]   and who, at least so far, have been unable to find
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.000]   a suitable spouse with whom they can procreate.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.360]   I have some ideas that I think will help with this.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.960]   I'll deal with that in a separate podcast episode.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.220]   I'll share, you can gain a few ideas from this episode,
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.820]   but we do need to fix this.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.400]   Right now, in 2024, relationship formation
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.440]   among young people is not working
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.760]   the way that it should be working,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.600]   and it's not working the way that it used to work.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.400]   Young people are not marrying
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   at the rates that they formerly did.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.920]   Young people are not coupling up
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.600]   at rates that they formerly did.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   Young people are not having sex
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   at the rates that they formerly did.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   Now, for above-average men and women,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.200]   women and men who are highly attractive,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.060]   then those numbers are not so bad.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.220]   But we can't just focus as a society
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.440]   on the top 10% of men and the top 10% of women.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.240]   We need to build a society that works for most people.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.760]   And this can be really, really difficult.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.820]   I think where I really started thinking about this
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.600]   was a number of years ago,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.000]   when I was doing private consulting work with clients.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.880]   I ended up having two separate women,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.500]   unrelated to each other,
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.400]   who both hired me as a financial consultant,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.720]   and both of them had chosen to procreate
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.060]   without a relationship with a man.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.880]   Both of these women, as far as I could tell,
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.960]   seemed like wonderful, attractive women,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.560]   physically attractive, they were highly accomplished,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.840]   career-driven, they did well.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.200]   I, of course, didn't spend enough time with them
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.480]   to make a deep assessment of their personalities,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.380]   but they just seemed like lovely, attractive women to me.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.880]   And those two women,
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.040]   neither of them had been able to find a suitable man
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.280]   that they wanted to spend their lives with.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   And so, as single women,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.920]   they had both conceived and born children,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.640]   planning for a lifetime of single motherhood.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.800]   I thought, is there any worse indictment of a society
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   where a woman who seems attractive and everything like that
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.540]   isn't able to choose a man who's working for her?
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.160]   And we all know lots of men who've not been able to,
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.240]   normally men don't go and intentionally choose
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.480]   to procreate without a woman involved,
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   but maybe their stories are out there.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.460]   But it just was pretty eye-opening to me
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.560]   of how difficult things are.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.460]   So we need to be really working on changing these things.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.400]   But that is a significant barrier,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   is simply for you finding someone
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   with whom you can procreate.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.200]   Now, the next barrier for you
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.020]   to have many great-grandchildren,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.440]   for you to have a hundred great-grandchildren,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.320]   is for you to have children.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.840]   And there are a few things that you need to think about here
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.880]   in your own thoughts.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.120]   Most of the financial considerations I'm gonna talk about
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.720]   in the context of your children and their children,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.560]   but there are some basic things
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.760]   that you need to think about.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.840]   If you've been able to build a relationship with someone
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.680]   with whom you desire to procreate,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   you need to solve fertility problems.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.040]   And there are a variety of levels of fertility problems.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.880]   The first level is just simply basic biological fertility.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.680]   A man's biological ability to reproduce
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.240]   and a woman's biological ability to reproduce.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.280]   Right now, for men of my generation,
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.720]   our sperm count is,
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.360]   if I understand what is reported properly,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.080]   something like half of the sperm count
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   of my father's generation.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.160]   It is, excuse me, testosterone levels.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.240]   Our testosterone levels are half
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.480]   of what the testosterone levels
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.680]   of my father's generation was.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.640]   So sperm count, but more importantly,
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.760]   testosterone is in shockingly bad shape.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.000]   And so there's a whole area of exploration
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.680]   that men need to be exploring to maintain high testosterone
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.920]   and to maintain high sperm count.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.960]   There are a lot of things that you can do.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.480]   Endocrine disruptors are probably a big issue.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.760]   You need to keep your genitals cool.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.320]   So anytime I see a guy sitting there
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.080]   with his laptop on his lap, I plead with him,
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.800]   "Please, don't do that."
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.200]   There's all kinds of factors that need to be factored in,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.760]   but you need to get your testosterone checked
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.560]   and you need to increase your testosterone,
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.720]   if at all possible,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.560]   with whatever the appropriate medical help is.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.300]   Many women today have basic problems
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.700]   with biological fertility as well.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.760]   I'm not as knowledgeable in that area,
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.120]   but it is across our society,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.760]   just basic biological fertility
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.640]   is something that has to be controlled for.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.360]   And if you desire to procreate and you desire to reproduce,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.740]   then that needs to be a consideration.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.560]   When I was younger, before I was married,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.240]   people would make jokes, usually about a woman,
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.480]   and they would say, "Oh, she's a woman
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.400]   "with good childbearing hips."
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.560]   That was the joke.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.440]   And when I was young and in college,
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.580]   I dismissed that as sexist, offensive sexist language,
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.400]   basically like, "Why would you say something like that?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.220]   "Why could you do that?
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.140]   "That doesn't sound nice."
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.220]   I never said I was going out in the world
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.300]   looking for a woman with good childbearing hips.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.460]   As it turns out, I was blessed with a woman
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.020]   who has good childbearing hips.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.460]   And when I've looked back at my ignorance
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.100]   when I was in college,
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.340]   I now am a little bit startled at how stupid I was
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.240]   to fall prey to the idea that,
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.140]   well, I still today would never talk
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.520]   about a woman's hips in that way.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.540]   I wouldn't use that language
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.800]   'cause I find that language offensive.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   The truth that was behind that cultural aphorism
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.220]   is something that's important.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.760]   And I derive an enormous amount of my satisfaction as a man
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.060]   from my family and from my children
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.980]   and from my wife's ability to have children.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.740]   And in hindsight, I was the fool at 20
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.940]   for just dismissing that as totally unimportant.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.880]   And so I think that things like fertility
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.720]   and screening a spouse or screening yourself
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.180]   on the basis of fertility is something that,
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.240]   well, awkward to think about or talk about,
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.260]   is probably something that will play a factor,
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.140]   play a role in our future.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   Because these basic issues have an enormous impact
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.900]   on men's and women's lives
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.660]   and they have an enormous financial impact.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.740]   One of the biggest expenses that I see
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.300]   in financial planning from wealthy people
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.140]   is often fertility treatments.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.100]   And when your babies cost you tens of thousands of dollars
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.600]   for each baby, you're gonna really think
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.060]   about that quite a lot.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.420]   And yet some of that can hopefully be avoided
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.820]   with better practices, with our children
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.940]   and protecting them from that and protecting ourselves
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:17.820]   as much as possible
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.300]   from basic biological fertility issues.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.380]   The next barrier for you to have many great-grandchildren
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.420]   would be what I call just philosophical infertility
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.660]   or philosophical fertility.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.580]   If you wanna have grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.980]   you need to marry somebody who desires children.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.980]   Both men and women in today's world are broadly infected
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   by a strong antenatal ideology, philosophy, and reality.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.060]   And don't think much that you're gonna change many people.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.140]   And so if you are young and you're doing something
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.900]   like setting a goal of having many great-grandchildren,
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.120]   you really should start off on your best foot
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.220]   by marrying someone and pursuing somebody
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.580]   who is not philosophically infertile.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.460]   Now, people can change, right?
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.700]   I'll just share my own dad's, my own father's story.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.460]   My parents had two children
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.700]   and kind of classic two-children story.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.980]   How does the rhyme go?
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.260]   A girl for me, a boy for you,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.660]   and praise the Lord, we're finally through, right?
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.940]   Boy and girl, done.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.540]   That was my dad's philosophy.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.180]   He did not want to have more children.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.740]   And then when his second child
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.620]   was something like eight years old,
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.540]   over a long period of change,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.580]   he came to adopt a different philosophy.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.820]   And it was a very difficult change for him.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.900]   My mom had wanted more children, but my dad didn't.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.420]   But eventually he came to be on board
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.620]   with wanting to have more children
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.220]   and dedicating his life in that direction,
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.860]   and he had five more.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.940]   And as the youngest of seven, I'm grateful that he did,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.820]   'cause I wouldn't be here if he had not changed.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.300]   People can change.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.020]   Men and women can change.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.780]   But you should focus on filtering
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.060]   for people who want to have children
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.300]   if that's something that you want to do.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.700]   And probably similar for those
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.900]   who don't want to have children,
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.340]   that you just don't want to have
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.700]   a significant difference in your perspective.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.500]   I think that also though,
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.420]   beyond just simply being open to children,
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.220]   it's important that you build
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:28.900]   an awareness of the fact that the data would indicate
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   that in general, you're probably gonna have
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.620]   a better and happier life with children than without.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.020]   Now you can go and look into this yourself,
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.660]   but people who have children,
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.500]   you know this intuitively if you just think about
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.460]   the things that people value later in life.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.380]   They're in today's antenatal society
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.380]   where many, many people shoot their TikToks and whatever
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.580]   about how great life is without children.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.740]   You can see that side and those arguments
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.660]   against having children.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.980]   And those arguments are today very persuasive
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.060]   for many young people.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.020]   Many young people are not having children
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.100]   due to livestock considerations.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.260]   If you talk to older people,
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.220]   and if you look at the sociological data on older people,
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   then you'll find that family life and children become,
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.900]   in general, a very important part
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.860]   of a man or woman's satisfaction with life.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.700]   I saw it put this way.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.660]   There was a Twitter conversation going on,
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.900]   and the data was showing about the percentage of adults
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.340]   who had children and the question they were asked
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.300]   among Americans 45 and older.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.500]   If you had to do it over again,
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.820]   how many children would you have
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.180]   or would you not have any at all?
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.060]   And Americans were asked about that.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.100]   And I won't try to read the whole chart to you.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.420]   But basically what you can look at
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:53.340]   is that 7% of parents over 45 wouldn't have kids
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.220]   if given a redo on life.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.540]   So 7% of people who are older than 45 who have children
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.580]   would not have children if given a second opportunity.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.380]   But 50% of childless people would have children
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.660]   if they were given another opportunity at life.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.780]   And a guy that I follow put it this way.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.020]   He says, "You're in your late 20s.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.620]   "You're ambivalent about children.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.900]   "Here's the probability for any given person,
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.100]   "but not for a specific person.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.940]   "Have children, 93% satisfaction rate.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.220]   "Don't have children, 50% satisfaction rate."
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:29.220]   So if you know that you wanna have children,
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.300]   you can pretty much have a 93% confidence
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.220]   according to that particular study
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.100]   that that's probably the right move.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.620]   On the other hand, if you don't wanna have children,
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.260]   just know that there's probably about a 50% likelihood
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.620]   that you're gonna regret that decision
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.500]   and then make your decisions yourself.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.260]   So think about philosophical fertility for yourself
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.940]   as you're making big life decisions.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.100]   And then age-related fertility.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.660]   Just simply the biggest problem happening
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.660]   in reproduction data and fertility data
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.900]   is that young people are not having children.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.940]   - You've always had what it takes to make it happen.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.460]   And we know the right tools can make it easier.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.580]   At Strayer University, we're always thinking about new ways
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.500]   to set you up for success.

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.460]   Strayer University is certified
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.060]   to operate in Virginia by Shell.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.540]   - If you want to have children,
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.500]   you should begin to have children when you are young,
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.740]   as young as possible.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.460]   And if you want to have more than one or two children,
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.500]   you should definitely begin to have children
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.900]   when you are young, as young as possible.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.340]   Most men and women are utterly ignorant
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.900]   of the impact of age on a woman's fertility.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.340]   At the age of 30, a woman has lost 90%,
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.340]   nine zero, 90% of the eggs that she was born with, 90%.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.180]   Doesn't mean that a woman cannot reproduce
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.660]   after the age of 30.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:11.300]   But the ignorance that men and especially women have
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.300]   on their ability to procreate at advanced ages,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.020]   meaning past 30, is pretty shocking.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.620]   It's really shocking.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.940]   And there is a high overconfidence
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.140]   in the effectiveness of fertility treatments,
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:30.660]   and there is a strong underappreciation across our society,
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.820]   just flat out ignorance of how easy it is
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.780]   for couples who are in their 30s and beyond
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.100]   to conceive children.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.540]   The problem is that we all get splash news stories
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.140]   across our screen of so-and-so
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.100]   who's 47 years old, had a baby.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.880]   Yes, and it was almost certainly with an egg donor,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.720]   if she's a celebrity.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.060]   People do have children at later ages, it is possible.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.260]   But the data on it indicates that it's very difficult,
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:03.060]   often very expensive, and it is not in any way assured.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.700]   So if you desire to have children,
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.160]   then this should be a priority for you when you are young.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.180]   Now let's assume that you're able
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.140]   to solve these basic problems.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.380]   You're able to meet and attract a spouse
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.720]   who wants to procreate, who wants to procreate with you.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.640]   You get married, and now you are thinking
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.920]   about the next generation.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.340]   You're thinking, how could I spend money
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.440]   in the direction of this goal of many great-grandchildren?
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.920]   How could I do that?
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.320]   I think it's really, really important
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.400]   to think about the culture that you build
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.680]   within your family, remembering that we can't coerce
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.360]   or manipulate our children to have children.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.240]   We need to think about what are the factors
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.520]   that are gonna make it likely
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.820]   for them to want to have children.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.900]   One great interest of mine, just in personal conversation,
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.580]   is whenever I meet somebody who doesn't want
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.260]   to have children, I try to understand why.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.420]   Try to understand what that person is looking for.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.220]   And although I come across as opinionated
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.100]   and whatnot on the internet, certainly, that's my job,
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.220]   but in real life, I don't go through life judging people.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.100]   I'm genuinely interested, and I'm really fascinated
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.820]   by people who, from my perspective,
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.120]   would seem to have had a great lifestyle growing up,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.880]   but who don't want to have children.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.320]   They just, it's not of interest to them.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.120]   And I think one of the factors is often
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.920]   that they just didn't have a great childhood,
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.840]   that they don't look back with fondness
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.920]   on their own childhood.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.800]   And I think that could be just a total death knell
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   to, if your ambition is to have many great-grandchildren,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.200]   you need to start by beginning
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.580]   with providing the best childhood
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.580]   that you're capable of providing for your own children.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.700]   And that's gonna begin with the relationship
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.120]   that you have with your spouse.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.040]   I think the first thing is you need to be preparing
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.840]   to have a house that is large enough
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.000]   to want to have children in it.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.880]   If we look at global population fertility data,
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.320]   what you see is that not having children
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:07.680]   and/or having very few children is highly associated
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.160]   with living in a big city.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.420]   Now, you could argue what the cause is.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.440]   Is it a correlation or a causation?
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.620]   Is it a correlation of you're surrounded
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.820]   by other people who are busy professionals
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.380]   who moved to the city to make their fortune
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.260]   and you're just kind of infected
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.760]   by this social contagion of not wanting to have children?
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.020]   Or is the city itself causing your childlessness
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.940]   or your low fertility?
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.580]   And I would say probably both,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.220]   as with most things of causation versus correlation.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.240]   They're probably both involved.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.760]   But as a man who travels the world
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.560]   with his wife and five children
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.360]   and who frequently stays in hotel rooms,
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.840]   I will tell you that life in a tiny studio apartment
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.640]   with five children is not pleasant.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.800]   It's not something that is enjoyable.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.360]   You're gonna need some space.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.600]   You need some space to spread out.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.520]   You probably don't need as much space as you think you do.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.040]   You probably don't need a nine-bedroom mansion,
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.760]   but you do need some space.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.980]   And I think this is one of the things
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.940]   that has been very helpful
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.480]   with maintaining the U.S.-American fertility rate
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.100]   as high as it has been,
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.760]   is that the United States is not such a country
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.860]   of big cities, but is rather a country of suburbs.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.780]   While I would argue that suburbs
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.200]   are not always good for children,
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.340]   and in fact, I prefer my children not grow up in a suburb
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.740]   'cause it causes them to be isolated from society,
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.740]   to be dependent on cars and things like that
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.140]   that don't give them much independence at an early age,
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.260]   truth is that having your own house that's big enough
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.580]   and that has a little yard has been much better
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.500]   for overall fertility in the United States
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.980]   versus living in the middle of a cramped city.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.900]   So you need to plan ahead.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.540]   You need to have a large enough house
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.500]   to want to have children in it.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.300]   You also need to have a marriage relationship
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.740]   that is filled with sex.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:46:00.060]   Children are created by sex between a husband and a wife.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.580]   That's where they come from.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.620]   And so you need to have a relationship
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.140]   that is built upon strong romantic attraction
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.580]   and where you have an active and vigorous sex life.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.020]   And that requires a significant amount of planning
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.860]   and preparation to do well.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.500]   And it requires you to probably communicate
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.180]   and make certain that you're marrying somebody
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.700]   who is open to sex and open to children.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.580]   One of the things that when I was a young man,
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.260]   I was pretty naive about the sexual problems
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.180]   that people have in relationships.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.860]   And I was shocked when I started interacting with people
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.540]   who would share with me confidentially
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.540]   about their non-existent sex lives within marriage.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.940]   In one case, there was a friend of mine
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.860]   and a client who, I won't even recount,
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.740]   but it was just shocking to me,
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.060]   the barrenness of his bedroom with his wife.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.100]   And that's something that is an enormous problem
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.380]   and it has to be dealt with.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.260]   And so I say it in something of a shocking way
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.780]   to say that you need a marriage relationship
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.900]   that is filled with sex, but it's very, very important.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.460]   It's very, very important that you create
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.100]   the kind of relationship and the kind of dynamic,
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.660]   and you choose the kind of person
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.580]   who wants to have sex with you.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.380]   And then you need to have enough time
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.780]   to do that over time and not be opposed to children.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.180]   If you go and you listen to people,
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.100]   especially from the Asian countries
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.620]   that have very, very low fertility rates,
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.900]   and you listen to them, they're all spending so much time
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.060]   busy working nonstop, working, working, working, working,
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.900]   working, working, working, that sex and sexual activity
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.400]   just doesn't seem to be a significant part of their life.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.780]   They don't seem to care.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:37.140]   And I've listened to interviews of Japanese people
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.980]   going around interviewing people in Japanese,
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.540]   and you listen to them and listen to how much
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.800]   married couples have sex, and it's shockingly infrequent.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.100]   So I'm not a therapist, I don't wanna be one,
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.820]   I just wanna point out that this needs to be discussed,
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.020]   needs to be talked about, needs to be planned for,
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.540]   and you need to make certain that you're screening
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.980]   and that prior to marriage, that you're screening
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.860]   for somebody who's gonna be able to match
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.540]   your own sexual appetite, and that the relationship
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.700]   that you build is the kind of relationship
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.660]   that has the appropriate safety
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.660]   and the appropriate romantic attraction
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.220]   for there to be plenty of sex,
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.380]   'cause children come from sex.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.780]   You also need to make sure that you have
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.580]   enough disposable income to feel like
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:22.020]   children aren't a burden, and you need to plan financially
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.460]   to eliminate the obstacles to children.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.900]   What are the obstacles?
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.360]   Well, obstacle number one often involves,
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.220]   if you listen to young people who don't wanna have children,
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.780]   say, "I'm not ready, I can't afford it."
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.100]   What are the obstacles?
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:38.100]   The first primary one involves debt, student loans.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.220]   Being in debt is a pretty good contraceptive,
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.460]   keeps people from wanting to have children.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.320]   So screen for that.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.220]   Screen for that prior to marriage yourself.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.260]   Don't marry somebody who's deeply indebted.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.580]   If you're deeply in debt and you wanna get married,
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.940]   get rid of the debt.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.420]   And you need to be aware of the fact
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.700]   that these are some of the psychological follow-on effects
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.020]   that are often not talked about
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.500]   purely in financial analysis.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.040]   One of the reasons people don't pay off their student loans
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.720]   is because they see them as good debt.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.820]   And in one sense, they are good debt.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.000]   Sometimes financial loans can enable you
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.860]   to earn a significant amount of money.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.140]   Often the interest rates on student loans are quite low
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.700]   compared to what you could earn
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.880]   with alternative investments.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.820]   In many cases, financially,
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.500]   it makes sense for you to invest
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:30.020]   into things that are gonna out-return your student loans.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.580]   I can't argue with that.
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.540]   If your student loans are at a rate of 3.5%
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.860]   and you can invest at a rate of 3.501%,
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.660]   then mathematically you should go and invest the money
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.780]   instead of paying off the loans.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.840]   The problem is those student loans are in many cases
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.260]   a pretty effective contraceptive.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.300]   And so if you wanna have children,
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.120]   you probably should consider clearing off
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.540]   those student loans.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.500]   Because the freedom that you feel
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.980]   and the confidence that you feel
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.340]   with regard to being debt-free
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.780]   may give you the courage and the strength
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.940]   to go ahead and have children when you want to,
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.800]   especially at a young age when you're able to,
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.020]   as compared to the long-term future benefits
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.260]   of 82 years from now,
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.340]   you having a slightly higher net worth
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.880]   because you've just made the final payment
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   on your student loans with your 3.501% returning investment.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.580]   This is the problem with financial planning.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.380]   We gotta balance math and we gotta balance life.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.220]   And sometimes, and math always should inform life,
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.220]   but life is not a mathematical calculation.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.980]   The second thing that often causes people
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.140]   to not have children is not owning a home.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.500]   And so again, you should consider owning a home
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.100]   as quickly as you're able to
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.180]   and putting yourself in a situation
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:54.180]   in which that home is a relatively small fraction
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.740]   of your overall financial incentive
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.580]   and overall financial value.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.660]   From a purely fertility-based analytical lens,
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.100]   a couple who buys a small home,
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.420]   maybe one of them bought the home
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.940]   and owned it before coming in,
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.300]   a small single-family home,
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.060]   has it debt-free and who has no debt,
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.500]   that couple is much, much more likely
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.740]   to welcome many children into their life
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.500]   as compared to a couple that lives in an apartment,
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.460]   has student loans,
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.340]   and is paying a rent payment every month.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.460]   So you need to think about those
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.260]   and build a lifestyle where you can do it.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.100]   And you wanna make sure
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.860]   that you have enough disposable household income
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:37.380]   just to feel like you can afford children.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.980]   What is disposable household income?
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.860]   Well, first of all,
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.180]   it starts with the total amount of money that you earn.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.460]   If you look at fertility rates,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.820]   there is an inverse correlation
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.700]   based upon whether you are a man
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.340]   or whether you are a woman.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.860]   Men, as men's income increases,
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.140]   the total number of children that men have
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.820]   increases concomitant with that rise in income.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.260]   For women, it's the opposite,
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.180]   that as women earn higher wages, earn more wages,
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.940]   then the number of children that women have goes down.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.420]   And I think that's intuitive.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:13.240]   Note, by the way, that that is not the same analysis
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.540]   as women's overall income or overall household income,
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.700]   but it's based upon wages.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.340]   Women who are wealthy,
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.260]   women who have a high household income
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.740]   and/or who are women who are wealthy,
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.780]   women who have royalties,
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.580]   women who have investment assets,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.300]   they do not suffer a decline in fertility
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.900]   throughout their lifetime because of their high income.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.500]   But women's wages are an indicator,
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.840]   making it more likely that a woman has fewer children
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.740]   if she earns higher wages.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.280]   Whereas men, it's the other side.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.840]   But total income is only one component of that.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   We need to focus on disposable income.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.200]   And disposable income is income that is available,
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.280]   basically margin in your budget.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.380]   And disposable income is something that is controlled
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.920]   based upon your expenses,
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.360]   based upon what you are committed to.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.860]   So you can have a household income of $100,000,
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:09.000]   but if your household expenses are, say, $90,000,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.520]   then that couple is not gonna feel financially confident
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.360]   to have children.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.700]   How could we do anything more?
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.540]   On the other hand,
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.360]   if the couple had household expenses of $60,000,
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.700]   then now that couple is gonna feel
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.740]   much more confident to have children.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.740]   So you need enough disposable household income
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.340]   to feel like children are not a burden.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.260]   And finances are an important component of that.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.740]   So if you're in debt, get out of debt.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.480]   If you can buy a house, buy a house.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.540]   If you can do it with a low amount of money, do it,
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.160]   and that's going to be more likely for you
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.560]   to be able to have children.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.620]   You need to develop the personal parental skills
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.700]   that will help your family life to be joyful.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.520]   One big obstacle to people having children
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.460]   is if you feel like you can't even handle the children
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.660]   that you have right now.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.620]   Generally speaking, I never set out to have five children.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.660]   That wasn't a goal.
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.700]   I would've said, my wife and I,
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.900]   if you'd asked us 10 years ago,
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.980]   we would've said, okay, well, we'd like to have children,
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.180]   but we didn't have a number.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.100]   I didn't plan to create a mega family.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.220]   At the time, I didn't have an ambition
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.960]   to have 100 great-grandchildren.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.800]   Just kind of happens one by one.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.520]   But as with each child,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.140]   you want to basically consider your life,
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:17.000]   and the goal is, the thing is basically, can we handle this?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.640]   Like, are we in charge of our family?
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.060]   Are we in control?
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.640]   Are we managing this, or are we overwhelmed?
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.140]   'Cause if you've got a couple that's just sinking
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.080]   under the burden of their children,
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.220]   then they're not going to want to have more children.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.200]   And so we want to build skills and parental skills
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.580]   that are going to help family life to be joyful.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.160]   Obedient children are a joy.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.820]   Disobedient children are not.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.400]   I don't like to compare children to dogs,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.940]   but I think in this case, we could compare it to a dog.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   If you've got a dog, and your dog is beautifully behaved,
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.400]   and you tell your dog to come, and the dog comes,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.900]   and you tell your dog to stop, and the dog stops,
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.660]   then for you, the dog is a blessing and a joy to your life.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.580]   But if you've got a dog
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.380]   that just runs out the door at every turn,
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.900]   and that stands in the middle of the table
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.000]   and pees in your flower vase,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.300]   then there's a good chance
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.220]   that you're not going to want any more dogs,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.660]   and children are similar,
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.380]   is that the skill that you have as a parent
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.940]   to deal with children is going to make a big difference
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.620]   in the likelihood of your having more children.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.480]   And this is one of the greatest tragedies
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.520]   in our current environment
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.140]   that causes people not to have children,
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.140]   is that you'll have a family that has one or two children,
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.620]   and the children are running their life.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.460]   And they don't really have anywhere that they can go
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.060]   or anyone that they can talk to that they trust
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.380]   who can give them advice.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:35.820]   We've had an enormous professionalization of child advice.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.220]   If you went back a hundred years,
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.820]   there were not any books written on how to raise a child.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.140]   Everyone grew up around children.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.860]   You had a society, there's children all around,
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.420]   and everybody kind of naturally absorbs
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.580]   how to have children.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.680]   In today's world, with the dearth of children,
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.620]   now we're going to have a baby,
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.180]   and we start going reading 15 books,
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.300]   and you have no way to filter
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.180]   and know whether the advice you're getting in the book
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.580]   is good or not.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.740]   You just grab something that fits with you
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.620]   and connects with you, and you go on with it.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.900]   And so people don't really have the experience,
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.160]   and then many people don't have the skills
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.540]   that in many cases, young fathers and mothers today,
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.420]   they don't have any model for skills dealing with children.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.820]   They don't know how to do it.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.180]   And that means that oftentimes their family life
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:20.940]   is not a joy, it's a burden, it's a tragedy.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.220]   I saw this horrendous video recently
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.500]   of this mom walking around her house with her camera.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.280]   And I think it was a mom, I watched it with the sound off,
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.940]   but she's walking around her house with a camera,
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.460]   and she's showing, and every room she goes into
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.940]   is a disaster zone.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:37.600]   And there are just, there are toys everywhere.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.780]   Every single floor is covered with toys.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.060]   Everything is destroyed.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.580]   The entire house is a wreck.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:48.380]   That video would be the most powerful contraceptive
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:52.000]   you can imagine for just an average young man or woman.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.500]   But it's not because you have to live that way with children.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.380]   It's because of the mother and father's ineptitude
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.920]   as parents and their unwillingness to clean up their house.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.640]   I have five children in my house.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.520]   It's not ready to be photographed
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.360]   on the front page of "Martha Stewart Living" every day,
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.500]   but at every moment, because children get toys out,
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.640]   they play with them, things happen.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.760]   You get involved in projects, and it's normal
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.460]   that there's going to be disruption to a house.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.780]   If you wanna live in a museum,
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.680]   don't get married, don't have children.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:26.780]   But the house is presentable by the end of the day.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.520]   And it can be made presentable
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.160]   in 10 minutes of picking up things.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.120]   And it's just a habit, it's a simple skill
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.280]   of picking things up and keeping a house picked up.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.800]   And you can expand that to every area of parenting.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.920]   Learning how to work with children
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.360]   is something that adds to go on.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.600]   So developing skill acquisition
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.240]   needs to be a component of what parents do.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.160]   Because you want your family life to be joyful.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.680]   You want your children to grow up in a house
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.440]   that's filled with peace and harmony
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.600]   and love and tranquility.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.600]   And they're not gonna see the Legos out on the floor
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.900]   as a disruption to that.
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.240]   But if they live in a hell hole,
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.800]   then they're not gonna wanna have children.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.880]   And so you wanna think about that.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.040]   If you wanna have children,
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.560]   a supportive community will be enormously helpful to you.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.280]   And so you may have to create it yourself.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.580]   You may not know anybody who wants to have children,
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.160]   but you wanna come around it
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.240]   and get yourself around a community of people
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.240]   who also like children and want to have children.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.260]   You may have to amputate negative peer pressure,
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.320]   and that may even be family.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.340]   In my wife and my family, we have family members.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.460]   We have to steel ourselves against the opprobrium
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.180]   that we receive from certain family members
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.260]   due to our reproductive choices.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.140]   Just deal with it.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.460]   Just tell, yeah, we're not gonna tell that person
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.260]   we're expecting a baby.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.900]   We'll just let them find out when the baby arrives.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.220]   It's easier that way.
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.060]   And this is pretty normal.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.520]   I know my parents, at one point in time,
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.620]   my mother's parents strongly offered,
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.000]   they were worried about how many babies
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:58.840]   my mother was having.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.080]   They said, "Listen, we'll pay for you to be sterilized.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.740]   "We'll pay for the surgery so you could be sterilized."
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.380]   My parents had to look them in the eye and say,
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.500]   "Get out of here.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.380]   "You're not involved in this component of our life.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.260]   "And if you continue to press on this, this is the end."
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.660]   And so sometimes you have to take a choice.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:18.460]   Remember that you have the right to live your life
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.020]   the way that you want to live.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.580]   And what's astonishing to me
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.580]   is that in the current wave and where we are
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:31.880]   is that there are kind of two sides to rights.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.760]   There are enormous numbers of people
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.560]   who are scandalized about reproductive rights
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.980]   and will say, "You have no right to tell me
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.200]   "what I can do with my body
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.800]   "and what I can do with the baby that's inside my body.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.520]   "These are my reproductive rights."
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.080]   That's the cultural ethic.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.440]   But in many cases, those same people
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.040]   feel like they have the right to turn around
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.420]   and tell you that you can't have another baby.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.800]   If you want to have a baby,
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.480]   that's between a husband and a wife, no one else involved.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.320]   That's it.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.560]   So deal with it in that context
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.320]   and shut out everyone else around.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.200]   But you'll find that if there's a community around you,
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.160]   a supportive community will be enormously helpful to you.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.240]   So those are just some thoughts in terms of yourself.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.480]   Those are incomplete.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.080]   But now I want to focus on
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.560]   how do we get the next generation?
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.960]   How do we get our children to want to reproduce
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.920]   and how do we facilitate that?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.480]   So I've talked about the pleasure and the memories.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:30.340]   If your children associate their own childhood
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.340]   with a pleasant family dynamic,
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.720]   then there's a decent chance that regardless
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.340]   of whether you indoctrinate them with a pronatal message,
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.260]   that they're going to want to continue it
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.740]   because they just naturally associate childhood
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.500]   with pleasant experiences.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.220]   And if you have, your children are going to think
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.900]   that the environment that they're raised in
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.260]   is pretty much what's normal.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.100]   In dealing with multiple children,
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.860]   so I talked about parental skill.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.580]   Parental skills change over time.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.980]   The cool thing is that children usually come one at a time.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.380]   Sometimes they come two or three at a time,
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.860]   but most of the time, one at a time,
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.100]   and your skills can change.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.380]   And it's really great.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.020]   With one baby, you learn a whole set of skills.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:10.860]   With the second baby,
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:11.860]   you learn a whole different set of skills.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.540]   With the third one and the fourth one and the fifth one,
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.860]   they're just a different set of skills
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.460]   at every stage along the way.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.300]   The cool thing, however,
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.540]   is that it's not only mother and father
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.840]   who are learning skills,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.620]   but your children themselves are learning skills.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:28.140]   And one of the reasons that low fertility rate countries
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.100]   have falling fertility rates
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.700]   is that the people in those countries
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:38.020]   can't even imagine how to be a parent of multiple children.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:43.020]   Let's say that you grow up in a one,
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.980]   you're the single child in a Chinese family,
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.860]   and you don't really know anybody.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.980]   You know a couple of people,
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.740]   one or two people who have two children.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.300]   You don't know anybody who has six children.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.900]   You don't know anybody.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.160]   And all of your extended family has just one child.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.140]   Well, the idea of having two children
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.440]   is something that you're gonna have no context for.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.980]   You grew up as one child.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.340]   You didn't even have brothers and sisters.
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.740]   You didn't have a younger brother or sister.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.860]   You didn't see your parents interacting
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.660]   with children of multiple ages.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.580]   You just have one child.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.300]   That's all of your frame of reference.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.660]   The idea of having two children
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.140]   is literally unimaginable to you.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.760]   You take all of your ideas and input and philosophy
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.700]   from what you see on TV.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.860]   And since what you see on TV or in a movie
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.820]   can be sensationalized one way or the other,
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.540]   either all glowing positivity or all scathing negativity
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.900]   based upon the agenda of the producer,
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.140]   then you don't really have any context for it.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.060]   So it just becomes literally unimaginable to you.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.540]   And the same thing continues to the generations.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.820]   Cool thing is that your family can change that.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:53.540]   And so I grew up with multiple siblings.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.500]   And so the idea of having siblings around is totally normal.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.940]   And then even if you're the youngest,
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.860]   like I was the youngest, in my growing up,
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.420]   my older siblings got married, had children,
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.580]   always around lots of children.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.340]   So the idea of being around lots of children
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.060]   is a totally normal thing.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.260]   And so that's one of the reasons
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.020]   you should focus on building a community,
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.000]   if at all possible, of other people who have children,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.140]   because that'll form a frame of reference for your children.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.060]   And you want children to think about their childhood
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.500]   and take pleasure in it.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.460]   Back to Asia, I myself shudder
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:27.460]   when I see videos about Asian children's youth.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.020]   And you find these videos,
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.820]   and basically as best I can tell,
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.520]   the children in many of those cultures in Asia
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.460]   live their lives chained to a desk,
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.180]   doing nonstop academic book work
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.620]   with threat of a teacher's ruler
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.620]   coming down on the back of their neck.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.520]   Little bit of hyperbole, not much in that.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.740]   The intense academic burnout.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.900]   A guy in, I saw a guy in India recently
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.660]   posted his high school study schedule
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.060]   with this just insane degree of academic commitment
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.860]   to study, study, study, study.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.540]   If that's your memory of childhood and it's all academics,
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.740]   just nonstop study, study, study, study, study, study,
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.580]   why do you wanna bring children into that?
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.500]   It's an utterly miserable life and a miserable existence.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500]   Yes, there's breaks.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.160]   I'm not being too extreme with my views.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.860]   I'm just drawing from the overall perspective.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.380]   When I think of my childhood,
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.740]   I think of pretty much nothing but pleasure.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.540]   Some of my most intense and appreciated family memories
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.460]   just involved traveling across the United States
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:32.660]   with my family and staying in national parks and state parks
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.100]   with a beat up old pop-up camper.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.940]   And didn't cost my parents a lot,
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.140]   it just cost them some time and to go out and do that.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.300]   But yet those family environments
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.180]   were so conducive to relationships.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.240]   We would stay in campgrounds
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.820]   probably 'cause we didn't have much money,
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.100]   but also because you stay in hotels with your children,
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.460]   there's nothing for the children to do.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.460]   Or you stay in a campground,
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.620]   it's just nonstop work or play, it's just all around.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:57.700]   And so those family dynamics of just being together
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.680]   is most of my memory of childhood.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.900]   Holiday gatherings, when you have holiday gatherings
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.980]   with lots of people, they're super fun.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.000]   And our holiday gatherings were always big.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.880]   It wasn't three people gather around a table,
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.300]   they're always enormous.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.140]   And what's interesting about the fun of large families
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.580]   is that not only do you yourself have lots of children,
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.940]   but the marginal cost of having other people in your life
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.220]   is usually not that big.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.100]   So imagine that you're a family of three, right?
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.920]   Two parents and a child.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   And you're gonna go out and invite four single people
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.240]   to join you for Christmas dinner.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.180]   There's always a spinster that you know,
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.100]   an old lady who doesn't have a family.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.660]   There's always some committed bachelor that you know,
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.060]   and there's always a Jewish guy
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.380]   and you know, just very, and a disabled person, right?
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.020]   I don't like to call them strays,
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.220]   but honestly, that's what I call them,
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.700]   just various strays.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.820]   And so our family always collected the strays.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.140]   Just imagine you're three people
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.840]   and you collect four strays for your Christmas dinner.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.160]   That's an enormous imposition on your lifestyle.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.940]   You probably don't even have enough plates.
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.980]   You don't have enough chairs.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.620]   Your table's not big enough for it.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.620]   And so it's a big deal.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.860]   Well, growing up with seven children,
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.760]   we were always at least nine.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.020]   And so for my parents to collect four or five strays
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.140]   for meals was just not that big of a deal.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:22.620]   And so that makes a fundamental difference
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   in the experience that someone has
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.340]   growing up in an environment where there's lots of people
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.740]   and people are associated with joy and with fun.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.940]   And that just simple experience
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.660]   changes your perspective of life.
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.380]   And so you wanna work really hard
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.340]   to facilitate an enjoyable childhood
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:42.860]   so that your children will have this perspective.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.260]   And so if you need to spend money
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.940]   to have a bigger dining room table,
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.440]   go buy a bigger dining room table.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.060]   If you need a bigger house, go buy a bigger house.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.840]   If you need a bigger car, get a bigger car.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.620]   These things are things that you can do
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.700]   to basically create the party wherever you go.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:00.700]   And just trying to share honestly and truthfully,
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.780]   in our current lives, in our current world,
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.800]   all of the infrastructure of life
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.980]   is designed around very small families.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.860]   So I had a friend of mine growing up, good friend.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.980]   They had two children.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.540]   And they always had normal cars,
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.980]   but the cars were always 5C cars.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.660]   And these were good friends of ours, lovely couple.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.380]   No argument or judgment of any kind.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.900]   I don't even know anything about their reproduction.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.660]   I wouldn't judge anybody.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.960]   But my observation was always, they always had four of them.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.240]   And the four of them always filled up their cars.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.920]   So they had two cars, five seat cars,
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.080]   and the four of them always filled it up.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.360]   They were never with other people.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.520]   They were never with other people.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.880]   They never invited anybody to go with them.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.640]   They never had room in their car for them.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.360]   They never invited anybody to go with them.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.380]   They never, they would go, they would go to an event,
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.680]   but they would always go in their own car.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.040]   And when I can think about that
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.380]   with my own childhood growing up,
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.600]   my dad always had a 12-passenger van.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.400]   He didn't need all the seats,
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.360]   but ours was always the party bus,
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.600]   bring in four or five other people with us.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.080]   And it was just always the case.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.200]   And so we grew up with lots of other people in our lives.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.400]   And that simple logistical difference
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.600]   makes an enormous qualitative difference
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.600]   in your experience of life and your experience of people.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.600]   I would be very surprised if my friends with the two children
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.560]   if any of their children went on to have many children,
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.120]   it's just not part of their culture.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.560]   And they can make the decisions they want to.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.400]   People can change.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.560]   My dad was one of two and he had seven.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.480]   So people can change.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.960]   My point is that these cultural things matter.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.840]   And in today's world,
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.880]   where you gotta have a bunch of car seats and whatnot,
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.400]   it keeps people from even being together.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.320]   I hear sometimes from my clients and people I interact with,
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.000]   one of the big problems of socialization
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.840]   is unlike even 30 years ago,
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.640]   you can't have someone to go pick up your kids for you.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.680]   Because if you've got young children and used to be,
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.560]   you would work it out and say,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.440]   "Hey, I'll drop the kids off at practice.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.280]   Can you go pick them up?"
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.520]   No, I can't pick them up because I have a five seat car.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.360]   Or even if I have a seven seat car, I don't have car seats.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.200]   So car seats are an enormous contraceptive.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.520]   I read a paper on it one time.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.280]   And the guy was saying, he drew a statistical analysis.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.720]   I can't remember all the details,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.000]   but he drew the statistical analysis.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.480]   Basically, could eliminating car seats
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.880]   dramatically increase fertility?
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.560]   And his mathematical argument was yes.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.760]   I don't know if it's true or not.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.400]   All I know is that my least favorite thing
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.560]   about being a father is car seats.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.560]   I despise them.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.840]   And I will be thrilled when the day comes
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.680]   where I don't have to do them.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.240]   For now, it's a necessary cost,
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.560]   but that is my, I'm not being hyperbolic.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.680]   That is my least favorite thing about being a father
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.320]   is having to deal with car seats.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.200]   Back to the point.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.040]   Infrastructure things that you can do with your life
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.160]   may help you to surround your children with others
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.160]   and may help you to have people around
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.560]   and have childhood be more of a joyous occasion.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.680]   If you have two children,
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.400]   don't just automatically buy a four or five seat car.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.240]   Consider getting the seven seat SUV.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.360]   So at least on occasion, if there's four in your family,
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.080]   at least on occasion, you can get three extra people
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.080]   and bring someone else's children home.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.840]   These little things matter.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.760]   But you need to build an environment of pleasure
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.080]   around your children.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.600]   Not nonstop frivolity.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.720]   I'm not opposed to working.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.680]   What I'm saying is that childhood should be a joy.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.640]   Don't overburden your children with just nonstop work.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.280]   Don't make your children hate school
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.560]   because they just do it all day, every day.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.820]   It's not necessary.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:49.760]   School and education seems to be
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.200]   a very, very effective contraceptive,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.920]   a very, very effective way to destroy fertility rates.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.920]   The more school that someone goes through, especially women,
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.080]   the more school that a woman goes through,
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.440]   the less likely it is that she has children
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.760]   or has many children.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.200]   I'm not opposed to highly educated women.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.280]   I'll talk about education in a minute.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.000]   But we need to recognize the fact
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   that if something is destroying your species survival,
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.440]   that you shouldn't just automatically accept it
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.980]   as an unqualified good.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:31.280]   Your ideology needs to include expansion of the group
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.560]   and expansion of the tribe in order for it to be effective.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.560]   And so we have to look and try to understand
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.800]   how do these things work.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.160]   And intense schooling for too long
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.800]   is not something that is increasing birth rates.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.840]   I think in addition to providing a joyful experience
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.820]   for your children,
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.360]   you should consider indoctrinating your children
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.100]   into experiencing the joy of family life.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.900]   Children in general are going to rise to the ambition
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:09.180]   that you as a parent give to your children.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.860]   You say to your child, you're gonna go to college.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.700]   Guess what?
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:13.760]   There's a very high chance
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.640]   that your child will go to college.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.720]   I went to college because we're the kind of people
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.560]   who go to college.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.880]   My wife went to college
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.640]   because her dad said you're going to college.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.160]   So she went to college.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.000]   That was it.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.560]   In general, it's pretty much the same thing.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.380]   Families who are college educated,
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.400]   their children go to college
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.680]   because it is expected that their children
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.880]   will go to college.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.420]   In many cases, children work a job
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.040]   because it's expected that you work a job.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.760]   And this creates all kinds of issues in people.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.560]   I have to leave my job and go be an entrepreneur.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.580]   And it requires incredible self-determination
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.740]   for them to go and be an entrepreneur
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.440]   because their family was job-having people.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.320]   On the other hand, it's entrepreneurial people.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.760]   And entrepreneurial people,
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.760]   they tend to consider it normal to have businesses.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.560]   Years ago, I was with Dan Miller.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.920]   This is on the podcast in the archives.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.560]   But I was with Dan Miller in Tennessee interviewing him.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.960]   And he was talking about his daughter.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.760]   And he was talking about the fact that with his children,
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.480]   he basically ruined his children to any kind of job
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.400]   because their entire lifetime,
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.740]   their father was always an entrepreneur.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.600]   And they always knew what it was like to,
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.480]   they never knew what it was like to have a two-week vacation.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.920]   They just did what they wanted to do
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.600]   'cause that's what you do as an entrepreneur.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.520]   You do what you want to do.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.760]   Now, a lot of times, you do a whole lot of work
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.600]   that you don't want to do,
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.560]   but you pretty much live your life how you want to live
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.040]   when you have a business that you can control.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.960]   And his point was that his children were either,
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.280]   some of them, they were entrepreneurs
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.080]   and very likely to be entrepreneurs
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.720]   'cause it's hard to trade that in for the benefits of a job.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.340]   I feel like I've pretty much destroyed
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:47.220]   my children's possibility of a job.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.060]   I hope not.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.460]   I hope they, I still want them to have jobs.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.220]   But in terms of the lifestyle that we live as a family,
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.340]   I think my children would find it hard to imagine
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:59.660]   if what it would be like for a mother and a father
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.620]   to go away to a job every day.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.820]   They've never had a mother who'd gone to a job every day.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.260]   And so that's just kind of the expectation
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.900]   that I would, that they have about motherhood.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.260]   And they've never had a father who had a job.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.960]   They don't remember when I had a job.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.980]   And while I work in an office, I'm pretty much always there.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.760]   And so that's their entire frame of reality.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.580]   Well, we can do this accidentally
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.620]   or we can do this intentionally.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.380]   And what is happening is our current generation
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.560]   of young people is indoctrinated to not have children.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.460]   We need to indoctrinate our children to have children.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:41.480]   That word indoctrinate is something that causes
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.940]   a significant level of discomfort in people.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:49.380]   We don't like the idea of indoctrination or propaganda,
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.880]   but in reality, I don't think we should be
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.620]   as uncomfortable with the word as possible.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.060]   I'm sorry, as we are.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.180]   I think that the concept that there would be
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:05.180]   some kind of neutrality in ideas is a myth.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.380]   There is no neutrality.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.540]   And so either you're going to indoctrinate your children
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.300]   with your beliefs and your vision and your philosophy,
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.540]   or someone else is going to indoctrinate your children
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:19.860]   with his beliefs and his vision and his philosophy.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.060]   There is no neutrality.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.900]   There is no neutral position really on anything.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:31.020]   Now you can choose the level of pronatal indoctrination
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:33.300]   that you give to your children.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.580]   Right now what we're seeing
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.540]   is there's an intense antenatal indoctrination.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.900]   Imagine you grew up in China
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:43.020]   and imagine that there was a one-child policy in place
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.060]   for decades and decades and decades.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:49.740]   And that if you had more than one child,
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   there would be a forcible abortion.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.500]   That indoctrination creates a society
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.860]   that can't reproduce itself.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:02.300]   Now you could go to another extreme ideologically.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.200]   You could indoctrinate your child
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.660]   that your ambition in life
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.100]   should be to have as many children
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.500]   as you possibly can have.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.500]   And you would have a woman who's pregnant
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.940]   for 35 years of her life and has 32 children,
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:17.100]   or a man who has seven wives
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.940]   and seven children with each wife.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.860]   That could be the kind of indoctrination
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.420]   that you could give.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.640]   But that's not, those aren't the only options.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.580]   You could indoctrinate your children
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.380]   with basically a friendly pronatalism,
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:36.020]   which is basically kind of how I would describe my position.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.700]   I'm not a, I don't think that people
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.600]   should have as many children
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.060]   as they're capable of having.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.500]   I don't think that, you know,
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.380]   I don't think that the goal
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.740]   is just to have as many children as possible,
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.280]   but I think that we should be welcoming
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   and appreciative of children
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.980]   because they're an enormous good in life and in society.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.500]   And that it should be between a husband and a wife
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.340]   and the intimacy of their own communications
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.000]   and the intimacy of their own bedroom,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.140]   the decisions that they make,
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.540]   and no outside interference.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.260]   That's kind of like a friendly pronatalism
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.680]   as I would describe it.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.740]   Maybe I'll be more of some extremist in the future.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:07.820]   I don't know, I don't think I will,
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.900]   but I can indoctrinate my children
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.780]   with a friendly pronatalism.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.780]   And that's my ambition is to appreciate children
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.380]   'cause children are the most valuable resource
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.540]   that we have in society.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.740]   They are children, they are people.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.300]   They are the ones who are going to solve
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.060]   all of the problems that we face right now
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.860]   and fix everything that's wrong with the world
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.700]   systematically day by day, generation by generation.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.980]   They are an unalloyed good.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.860]   Children are an unalloyed good.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:39.120]   There is no, there is nothing bad about children.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.260]   So children bring challenges.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.740]   There's nothing bad about challenges.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.980]   Challenges are good for us.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.660]   And so the point is that you need to indoctrinate
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.860]   your children intentionally or someone else
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.700]   is going to indoctrinate your children intentionally.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.660]   And your children are gonna be 16 years old
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.660]   thinking that they should delete themselves from the earth
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:00.660]   to save the planet and some other dumb philosophy.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.500]   So why not just indoctrinate our children
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.380]   into believing that getting married and having children
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.980]   is a great thing to do?
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.100]   Every bit of sociological data
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:17.740]   is on the side of that being the right choice.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.700]   And as long as we reserve appropriate levels of reserve
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.740]   to say that, hey, you may be different, right?
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.620]   You might be someone who doesn't want this, that's fine.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.860]   But every bit of data indicates
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:31.860]   that this time-honored tradition of how to live your life
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:35.340]   and how to grow your family is a really powerful one.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.620]   Every bit of data indicates that that's the right move.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.060]   So let me indoctrinate you into what the data says
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.740]   and then allow for different decisions.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.140]   If your child wants to go
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.260]   and spend 10 years living in Tibet, great, that's fine.
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:49.260]   I'm not gonna force you to,
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.260]   I'm not gonna drag you kicking and screaming
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.180]   into an arranged marriage
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.900]   and say you have to marry this girl right now.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.220]   That would be absurd.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:58.100]   But we shouldn't shy away from recognizing
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.940]   that we need to indoctrinate our children
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:05.340]   into the right beliefs that are most likely
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:09.860]   to leave them living happy, successful, fulfilled lives.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.700]   And getting married and having children
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.060]   is an important component of that.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.340]   We know that all the data is on our side.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:18.460]   We also know, by the way,
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.780]   that for all the data that is not on our side,
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.020]   meaning statistical outliers,
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.860]   many people say the worst thing I ever did was get married.
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.460]   Worst thing I ever did was have children.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.300]   We know that a lot of that was entirely avoidable.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.620]   And so poor mate selection
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:34.580]   is the fundamental flaw in marriage.
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:37.900]   Not the institution of marriage, but poor mate selection.
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.420]   And we can control for that.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.660]   We can adjust for that.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:41.980]   We can teach our children that.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.220]   And we need to indoctrinate our children
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:48.340]   into the importance of choosing a high-quality spouse.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.620]   I talk about this with my children.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.420]   I don't want them to be 18 years old
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.420]   and say I wanna get married
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.220]   and me saying don't marry that guy, he's a loser.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:59.180]   I want my children at 18 or 20 or 25
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.380]   to be very discerning and to be thinking about
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.380]   what are the qualities that would make someone
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:06.580]   a good prospective husband, a good prospective wife.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:07.940]   I need to be thinking about that.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.140]   And I need to control my impulses
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.780]   and not be drawn to somebody who's bad for me.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.140]   Oh, it just feels so good.
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.860]   This guy, he's toxic.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.300]   She's toxic, but somehow I should pursue her.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.820]   No, that's stupid thinking that leads to tremendous chaos.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:25.660]   And don't let your children absorb that.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:26.660]   It's stupid.
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.660]   You don't go after people who are bad for you
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.380]   and somehow think that if you just spend more time
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.580]   with this girl who's bad for me, but it feels so good.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.420]   No, it doesn't work out.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:38.820]   The movie ends right before the divorce.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:39.980]   So don't go down that road.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:40.820]   It's stupid.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:44.180]   You need to indoctrinate your children
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:46.620]   to experiencing the joy of family life.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:50.460]   We need our daughters to have ambitions to motherhood
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.420]   instead of only having ambitions
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:54.460]   to be a boss babe stem chick.
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:00.460]   It's important that motherhood be something
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:04.380]   that is appreciated in society.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:09.340]   You and I can be the ones to change the culture around this,
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.900]   not the entire culture.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.140]   There's gonna be a whole lot of boss babes stem chicks
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.460]   created by our culture right now.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.380]   But you and I can start it.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:20.740]   I always find it interesting that I go on Netflix
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.940]   and Netflix has an entire category of girl power movies.
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:27.060]   There's no category for boy power movies.
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:30.460]   There's no category for motherhood movies.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.340]   There's just a category for girl power movies.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.020]   And so we need to change that.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.580]   We need to lionize mothers
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:43.420]   and we need to cause our appreciation of motherhood
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.900]   and mothers to be transformed
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.540]   so that motherhood is transformed
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.620]   into a high status occupation.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:55.060]   I want my daughter to be married to a man like me.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:57.580]   That's my first responsibility as a father.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:01.260]   I need to be the kind of man that sets the example for her.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.900]   That's my responsibility.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.860]   But I want her to marry a guy like me.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:07.300]   I think objectively speaking
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.500]   that my wife has a pretty great life.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.140]   It's not perfect, it's not easy,
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:16.420]   but I would say that on a scale of zero to 100,
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.780]   it's pretty stinking good.
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.900]   I'm probably not a 10 as a husband, right?
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.820]   I'm not a 10 out of 10.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.660]   There's guys out there that are richer than me,
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.940]   better looking than me,
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.740]   have better abs than I do, smarter than me.
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.620]   But in terms of the overall package,
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:34.380]   my ambition in life is to be a dream husband for her.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.900]   And I wanna model what that looks like,
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.300]   not only for my good, for the health of my relationship,
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.780]   but for my daughter to aspire to.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.700]   And I think that being a mother
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:50.980]   is a pretty great lifestyle choice for my wife.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:54.900]   What does it mean for me to be a great husband?
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.060]   Well, it means adequately providing for my wife,
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.540]   providing the luxuries that I'm able to provide,
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.420]   retiring her from the job market
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:05.660]   so she can sleep in every day,
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.700]   sexually satisfying her,
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.780]   providing a strong social group for her,
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.060]   providing her with children,
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:13.740]   supporting her and her goals and ambitions
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.980]   and the things that are fulfilling to her.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.740]   And as the father of my family, that's my responsibility.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.620]   My wife's goals and ambitions are mine.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.460]   I take them on as the father, as the leader of my family.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:27.780]   And all of our family planning
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.820]   gives priority to those things.
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:31.420]   Now she's got her own set of duties.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.740]   She's got her duties to be an excellent wife to me.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.740]   She owes me loyalty and support
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.820]   and my callings and ambitions.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.500]   She needs to create a home environment
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.220]   that provides me with peace and comfort and joy.
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.620]   She should seek to sexually satisfy me,
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.900]   to take good care of our children,
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.740]   to be a loyal partner in life.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.620]   So there's a beautiful harmony between these things.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.740]   But the point is that being a mother
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.740]   should be an attractive thing
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:02.300]   and we can model that for our daughters.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:06.180]   Now, I don't myself like making abrasive remarks
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.060]   or being abrasive or taunting people,
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.700]   but what we need to do is we need to show this to the world
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.020]   and we need to raise it up.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:14.700]   Because what happens is we spend so much time
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.580]   apologizing for the drunk husband
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.900]   that says, "Well, I'm gonna get me a beer,"
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.220]   and is abusive and whatnot.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:23.220]   And that's such a meme that a lot of times
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.380]   our daughters and young women
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:28.180]   are just living their lives scared.
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.340]   They're scared that every man is drunk and abusive.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.620]   Every man doesn't care about them.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.660]   Every man is gonna use them and grind them up.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.700]   And that is just not true.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.740]   It may be that the most visible men,
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:43.420]   the people who are most obvious in society,
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:47.340]   the guys who get the most views on their toxic TikTok,
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.420]   maybe they're really toxic.
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:55.420]   But those of us who are not need to be equally strong
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.460]   in marketing what is good and what is satisfying,
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.620]   what is beautiful about our lifestyle.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.780]   My favorite brand of content in the world is mother content.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.420]   I wanna see it 100X.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.140]   I wanna see, there's this lady,
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:15.060]   I don't know her name, but I'm aware of her.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:15.900]   There's this lady,
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.300]   I think she lives out in Wyoming or something like that.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.820]   She makes these Instagram things of her cooking
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.660]   this just insane food.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.700]   And she's at this wood stove,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.100]   and she's at this wood stove
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.740]   surrounded by little children in an apron
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.740]   looking like a 1935 housewife,
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.500]   barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen,
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.660]   and making this just like elaborately homemade food
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.340]   from all of the stuff that was grown on her property
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.740]   and whatnot.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.620]   And the commenters love to point out
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.140]   that she's cooking on a $30,000 wood stove,
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.220]   because I don't know,
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.140]   either she or her husband is the heir or heiress
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:53.420]   to this vast fortune.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.260]   And I love it.
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:55.100]   I love it.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.140]   I am so grateful that woman exists.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.740]   I hope that she gets millions and millions of followers
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.380]   because her lifestyle is attractive.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:03.900]   She's surrounded by all these children,
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.300]   and she's cooking on a wood stove,
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.980]   and it's just pure luxury,
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:11.300]   but it's different than toxic luxury.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.140]   We need more of that because,
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.380]   and we need more of it in public,
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.840]   in view of young men and women.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:22.300]   It's hard for me to talk about my private life sometimes
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.660]   because I don't enjoy the backlash of the internet.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.900]   I don't enjoy fighting with people
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.020]   who just wanna come and make fun of me
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.860]   of things that I hold dear.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.980]   I also don't really wanna put my children on the internet.
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.620]   I've thought many times I should show.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.540]   I mean, we do slide shows and family movies
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.220]   of all the places that we go.
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.220]   We visited 16 countries last year,
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:44.700]   and so I have a little movie that I made of each country,
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.060]   and we go through it with my children,
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.020]   and we kind of relive the memories,
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.540]   and we talk about these.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.700]   I love my life.
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.180]   My life is awesome.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.520]   It's not perfect, but it's awesome.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.000]   It's really good.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.140]   And I sometimes think like I should share more of that.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.220]   And I'm doing that here in this context.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:03.540]   And I want you to do that.
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.260]   I want you to share your life.
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:08.140]   I want people to see and to understand
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:12.260]   that your life doesn't end because you have children.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.900]   It's not like you just can't travel the world
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.260]   because you have children.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.540]   And maybe someday I'll decide
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.060]   that it's right for me and my family
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   to put movies out online.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.580]   But for now, I just try to support people that do it
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:26.620]   and just say that you create your reality.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:30.380]   And it's not as though you have either a bad life.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:34.220]   You create it.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.740]   And I want to share the message
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:36.900]   that I'm sharing with you now
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:39.300]   that children are really great.
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.500]   One of my favorite memes that I saw recently
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.780]   about motherhood was this.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:45.940]   I forget what the image was.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:49.260]   But it's like, girls, get this.
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.820]   It's like OnlyFans, but you've got only one fan,
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.020]   and he's a subscriber for life,
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.180]   and you bear his children,
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:59.540]   and he pays all the bills for the rest of your life.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.500]   Like, it's great.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.380]   It's like OnlyFans, just one fan,
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.820]   and it works out for life.
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.100]   And it sounds ridiculous, but we need more of that.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:09.260]   Because you got a whole generation of OnlyFans girls
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.580]   going around and doing everything they can
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:13.260]   to get naked for random men on the internet
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.740]   to pay their bills.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:19.740]   And if they were just willing to be a great wife and mother,
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:22.380]   they would find a great guy
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:26.780]   who will appreciate her getting naked for him,
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.540]   and he'll pay all her bills.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:31.340]   It's a pretty simple contract, and it still works.
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:35.900]   So let's be those who encourage our daughters
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.180]   to have ambitions to motherhood
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.820]   instead of only having ambitions
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.940]   to be boss babe stem chicks.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.020]   We also need to build stronger men.
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.700]   Hi, I'm Chris Gethard, and I'm very excited
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.180]   to tell you about "Beautiful Anonymous,"
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.940]   a podcast where I talk to random people on the phone.
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.180]   I tweet out a phone number.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.620]   Thousands of people try to call.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.460]   We talk to one of them.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.460]   They stay anonymous.
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:57.420]   I can't hang up.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:58.460]   That's all the rules.
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.980]   I never know what's gonna happen.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.460]   We get serious ones.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.380]   I've talked with meth dealers on their way to prison.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:05.660]   I've talked to people who survived mass shootings,
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:06.620]   crazy funny ones.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:08.060]   I talked to a guy with a goose laugh,
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:10.500]   somebody who dresses up as a pirate on the weekends.
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.940]   I never know what's gonna happen.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:13.100]   It's a great show.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:15.820]   Subscribe today, "Beautiful Anonymous."
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.780]   Men who have ambitions for family
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.380]   and who are willing to do the hard work necessary
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:25.380]   to attract and deserve a high-quality woman.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.380]   As a man and as a father,
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:31.940]   you are going to bear enormous burden and responsibility,
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.460]   and you'd better be ready to handle it.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:37.340]   Now, the good news is that burdens and responsibilities
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.020]   in the natural course of family life
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:41.060]   and in business life and in most life,
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.500]   they grow progressively.
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.900]   They grow little by little,
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.500]   and as you bear one little bit of responsibility,
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.740]   you become stronger and you bear the next one
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.580]   until you turn around and you're 30 years old
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.660]   or you're 40 years old or you're 50 years old,
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:55.940]   and you are a giant of a man.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:58.460]   That's the way that life is supposed to work.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.380]   But you do need to be ready to handle
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.180]   the ones that you encounter.
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:05.140]   So you need to be a man who is in control over emotions.
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:06.940]   You need a man who is filled with kindness
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:09.260]   and consideration for other people.
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.540]   You need a man who has a strong earning ability
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.500]   and a strong work ethic.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.980]   Women are not wrong for wanting a man
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:17.580]   who makes a lot of money.
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:20.400]   Women are absolutely right to desire a man
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.660]   who makes a lot of money.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:25.100]   So you have to develop your work ethic
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:26.100]   and your earning ability,
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.340]   and you have to do it intentionally.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.540]   You can develop a strong moral character
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.160]   with a minimum of vice.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:37.780]   One of the great complaints I have about our popular culture
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:41.100]   is we celebrate vice.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.220]   We celebrate things that are destructive.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:48.780]   What has destroyed over the years more marriages
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.080]   than something like alcoholism?
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.180]   Having a drunk dad is a pretty good guarantee
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.460]   that you don't wanna have children,
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.060]   you don't wanna be a dad.
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:03.060]   And yet alcohol has destroyed enormous numbers of families.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:07.420]   And yet in our popular culture, what do we celebrate?
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.340]   Drunkenness.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:12.700]   And I complained about this a number of years ago
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.460]   when I was at a professional conference.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:17.000]   And I haven't been to any kind of industry conferences
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.740]   for a few years now, so maybe it's changed.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:19.900]   I hope it has.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.200]   But it used to drive me crazy.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.380]   You go to an industry conference,
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.860]   I would go to a podcasting conference
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.980]   or a FinCon or something like that.
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.500]   And you get up on the second day
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.180]   and the first speaker on the second day,
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.380]   hey guys, what a great party that was last night.
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.540]   I'm amazed that you're here and can anybody remember it?
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.500]   And just this constant cultural celebration of drunkenness
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.060]   which destroys families.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.580]   Don't do that.
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:44.180]   Gambling, the generosity in all of its forms
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:45.740]   has to be gotten rid of.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.460]   And so you need to develop, as a man,
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.500]   you need to develop strong moral character
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.980]   and get rid of vices.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:52.540]   And you need to develop the ability
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.780]   to inspire confidence and trust.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:58.340]   The decision that a woman would make
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.540]   to bear your children as a man
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:04.780]   or to be willing to be your wife
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.240]   and even consider being a full-time mother,
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.660]   in order for that to happen,
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:13.660]   you have to inspire confidence and trust.
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:20.560]   You have to be the kind of man who can inspire her in that
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.100]   because she is consciously choosing
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.100]   to make herself vulnerable if she makes that decision.
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:34.140]   The vulnerability that a woman endures with that is enormous.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.660]   It is properly fear-inducing.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.660]   And so she has to make a good decision about you
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:44.020]   and be confident in that decision.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.020]   And I think that one of the biggest impacts here
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.680]   is that men themselves have become very antenatal.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.460]   Instead of having a vision of a hundred great-grandchildren
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.720]   and your descendants being as many
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.780]   as the sands of the seashore,
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:05.600]   a lot of men rejoice in the extra money
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.060]   that their wife can bring in for them.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:11.760]   They push her to bring in more money
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.240]   so they can buy a nicer set of golf clubs.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.260]   It's just toxic guys
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.860]   that create the environment around themselves.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.640]   Here's a, I'm gonna read to you verbatim,
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.780]   just this beautiful message
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:23.940]   that I received from a listener of mine.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.740]   And we were talking about this in a different forum.
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.080]   And this listener wrote to me and she said,
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.940]   "Overall, the greatest impact to support these women
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:31.980]   "has been the shift in priority.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.780]   "It's not just women, it's their husbands too.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.260]   "So many women need the push to give up their career
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:39.460]   "and the biggest catalyst is their husband.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.180]   "So many men are fearful of losing the second income
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.740]   "that they put pressure on their wives
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.900]   "to work full-time out of the home.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.500]   "Then the wives put pressure on themselves to come home
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.020]   "and do the second full-time job
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.280]   "of motherhood and homemaker,
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.440]   "hence one or two kids or zero.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.720]   "In addition, when a husband supports his wife
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.260]   "to shift her priority to being a homemaker,
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.600]   "she has time to meet other moms
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.760]   "and participate in programs like M-O-P-S
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.600]   "and thus be more encouraged, supported,
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.440]   "and as a result, feel free to have more children.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.020]   "It's also difficult for these women
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:10.460]   "when they get married later
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.080]   "because they've been supporting themselves
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.260]   "for so long.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.800]   "It can be scary to be unemployed.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.420]   "I speak from experience.
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:20.900]   "When my husband asked me to stay home, I was terrified.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:23.860]   "I had been supporting myself for 10 years up to that point
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.880]   "and now I was being asked to not do what I had known
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.460]   "and to be fully reliant on his income."
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.260]   So this is an important thing.
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:35.820]   You need to understand that for a woman to believe in you,
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.780]   you need to be worthy of being believed in.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.780]   There's this, if we look at the current mismatch
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:46.980]   in the dating environment,
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.880]   there's an element of truth in a lot of the things
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.060]   that are really frustrating
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.920]   and really angering to a lot of people.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.280]   And so filter the current content you hear
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.520]   of the complaints and the frustrations.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.080]   Filter the current content that you hear
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.720]   and recognize that it has an application.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.680]   I'll just give two examples, one for women, one for men.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.680]   There's this meme online in popular culture
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.260]   about what do you bring to the table?
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.220]   That men are now asking women,
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.920]   "What do you bring to the table?"
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.340]   And of course the woman always responds,
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.840]   "Well, I am the table.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.780]   "If you don't like that, if I'm not good enough for you,
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.600]   "then just move on, buddy."
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.540]   And what you should hear if you are a woman,
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.000]   you should hear men saying like,
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.020]   "Wait a second, why do I need you?
[01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:33.740]   "What benefit do you bring to my life?"
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.200]   That's a fair question to ask.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.760]   And what has happened is that many women
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.280]   have been trained by our society
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.940]   to bring everything to the table
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.760]   for the man who signs their paycheck
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.000]   and nothing to the table for the man
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.300]   who gives them their life.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.720]   That's the distinction.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.440]   And so you need to ask yourself,
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.960]   "What do you bring to the table?"
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.000]   If you are a woman.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.540]   "What do you actually provide to a man
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.080]   "that would cause him to wish to marry you
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.560]   "and have children with you?"
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.360]   If that's something that you desire.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.800]   Similarly, on the flip side, it goes towards men.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.920]   Women tend to want a man who is strong,
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.080]   who is tall, who is good looking,
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.460]   and who earns good money.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.360]   Well, guess what, buddy?
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.740]   You gotta be those things.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:27.600]   You gotta be the kind of man who can provide for your wife.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.840]   You can't be the guy who has no ambition,
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.640]   just sitting around, I don't like to use the cliche,
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.560]   but it's true, just sitting around
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.800]   playing video games constantly
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.760]   and not able to provide for a woman.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.200]   What do you have to offer her?
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.800]   You don't deserve her 'cause you can't offer her anything.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.040]   So I'm not gonna go further down that,
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.120]   but you need to think about that
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.240]   and recognize that in every cliche,
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.040]   there's an element of truth.
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.000]   And if you listen through it carefully,
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.160]   you can develop yourself to attract and inspire
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.400]   the kind of relationship and lifestyle
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.360]   that you desire to have.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.500]   We also need to increase respect for men who are fathers,
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.000]   not just men who are rich.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.640]   So for our sons,
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.860]   fatherhood should be something that has social respect.
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:19.620]   In our financially driven age,
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.880]   what today we tend to do
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.220]   is we tend to raise men on a pedestal
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:26.540]   based upon how much money they earn,
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.920]   how many followers they have,
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.160]   or some other similar metric.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.560]   And we don't differentiate men who have those things
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.320]   from men who are strong fathers and men of character.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.280]   And I don't know how to do it, but we need to do that.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.080]   I was blind to this when I was younger.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.000]   I was a big Tim Ferriss fan.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.520]   I was a big, well, I won't name all the names,
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.520]   but I was blind to it.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:53.520]   Sorry for picking on Tim.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.360]   I usually give a long list, but it's not necessary.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.520]   I was blind to this.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:57.840]   I thought, I wanna be like this guy.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.680]   I wanna be like this guy.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.520]   I wanna be like this guy.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.560]   And today I look at them and I'm like,
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.280]   I don't really wanna be like any of them.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.960]   I appreciate them for the wisdom that they have,
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.000]   but I wanna be like that guy over there
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.360]   who has five children and he's a pillar in his community.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:16.160]   He's a leader in his local city.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.880]   He's an elder in his church.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.560]   He is a businessman who runs an honest business.
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.560]   And he may not make as much money as so-and-so over there
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.720]   who's destroying society does,
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.560]   but I'm not gonna raise up so-and-so
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.920]   because he makes more money
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.680]   and his work is destroying society.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:35.800]   I'm not alleging that Tim Ferriss is destroying society.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.080]   What I'm saying is we need to filter that.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.360]   And we need to be very careful of who we ourselves admire
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:46.240]   and then who we encourage to be admired in the world.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.240]   And it's not easy to do.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.720]   It's not easy to do,
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.400]   but we need to figure out new ways to do that.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.000]   And we need to bestow status on men who are fathers,
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.480]   both biological fathers,
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.640]   just simply due to their being fathers,
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.160]   and then the fullness sense of the word,
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:06.040]   the word that we all, the sense that we all aspire to.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.120]   Being a father should be a high-status occupation.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:13.440]   One of my favorite things from the Bible
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.600]   is that a man's qualifications
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.560]   for public Christian ministry
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.560]   are all based upon his being a father.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.680]   If you look at the qualifications
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.680]   for a leader, an elder, and Titus, and Timothy,
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.080]   it's based upon his family.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.360]   Because if a man can't govern his own family,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.320]   how can he govern the house of God?
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.800]   I wish for a culture.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.840]   I desire a culture in which we take that farther.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.760]   We always need to be cautious
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:49.680]   that we don't exclude men and women who don't marry,
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.600]   who don't have children.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.280]   I think that we could take it in the wrong direction.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.360]   But we should appreciate men who demonstrate themselves
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:01.120]   as strong and capable men in the intimacy of their home,
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.680]   where their children respect them and admire them,
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.280]   and their family is well-run and is happy and contented.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.600]   And then we should promote them
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.600]   to other positions of responsibility,
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.040]   'cause they've learned a lot.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:16.720]   Hopefully, these qualitative factors
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.680]   will help our children want to build families
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.760]   and dynasties of their own.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.360]   But they're still going to need our financial support.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.160]   And I think that we can do a lot
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.760]   to support our children financially
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.760]   so that they can themselves go on and repeat the process.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.400]   If these qualitative factors are present,
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.680]   I don't think that the money is strictly necessary.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.640]   What I mean is, if you're raised
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:54.600]   in a loving, caring environment to parents who are paupers,
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.360]   and yet they instill values in you,
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.080]   you have a contented home life filled with joy and happiness,
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:06.960]   you can solve everything else yourself.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.920]   There are many poor children
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.120]   who have been raised in great circumstances,
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.520]   though those circumstances reflected financial poverty,
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.520]   who have gone on and gone to college
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.160]   and gotten great jobs and continued on.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.200]   On the other hand, there are lots of people
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.160]   who are raised in wealth
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.560]   who grow up in a toxic family environment
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.840]   and don't go on to reproduce, grow the family,
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.320]   and you have just mass chaos and catastrophe
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.120]   in the family line.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.400]   So if you could only have one or the other,
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.120]   I would beg you to have the qualitative factors.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.120]   But as a listener of Radical Personal Finance,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.600]   the data shows me that you have above-average resources.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.280]   So my question is, can you spend that money
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:57.280]   to help these qualities pass on through the age?
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.640]   We all know you can.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:05.920]   One thing that I hear very frequently from wealthy people
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.000]   is that they so appreciate that their parents paid
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.400]   for their college education so they could start debt-free.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.560]   We'll talk more about that in a moment.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.280]   And so they wanna do the same thing for their children.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.200]   This is a good expression of spending money on children
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.160]   where it really pays off
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.280]   because now your children can get married sooner.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.520]   They don't have to pay off a bunch of student loan debt.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.880]   Your children can have children sooner
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.120]   'cause they're not deeply in debt.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.440]   There's lots of things that you can do,
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.880]   but let's expand it a little bit.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.200]   Let's break it apart.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.160]   So as parents, recognize that there are individual steps
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.840]   to family formation for our children.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:41.760]   Family formation means first attracting a spouse.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.280]   In some cultures, it might mean being able to attract
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.040]   someone with whom you can arrange a spouse,
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.200]   but in our culture, it's pretty much the children
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.320]   need to be the ones attracting the spouse.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.320]   So your child will need to be able to attract a spouse,
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.960]   ideally at a young age.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.960]   Your child will need to be able to select his or her spouse,
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.040]   then marry the person, and then have children
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.800]   and continue down the line.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.400]   And so let's break it apart into those component parts
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.080]   so that we can think about ways that we could influence that.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.920]   The first component of attracting a spouse
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.960]   is if at all possible, we want to help our children
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.320]   to be highly attractive.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.520]   I use that word broadly,
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.280]   and I want you to fill in what that means,
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.800]   but we wanna help our children to be highly attractive
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.720]   in every sense of the word.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.160]   That includes physicality.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.440]   We want our children to be in great shape,
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.640]   not to be fat, not to be weird, not to be skinny,
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.480]   not to be diseased.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.800]   We want our children to be strong,
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.080]   healthy specimens of young people.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.240]   So anything you can do to help that happen
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.080]   is really valuable.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.280]   I was with a family recently and they said,
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.640]   we're not gonna tell our children
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.540]   what sport they have to play, but you gotta play a sport.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.120]   It's necessary that you play a sport.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.160]   You're always gonna play a sport.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.880]   Well, that's a really great way to help your children
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:03.480]   to be active at all times and develop the physicality
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.960]   that goes with this.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:09.360]   John Taylor Gatto, the well-known educational,
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.880]   well, the well-known educator
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.280]   and then commentator on education.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.920]   He had 12 qualities of elite,
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.560]   basically the elite private schools teach their children
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.120]   or ways, things that the elite teach their children
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.600]   coming from all the finest boarding schools in the world.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.000]   And one of those things that elite families
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.040]   always teach their children
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.200]   is a strong involvement in athletics
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:38.360]   because they know that athletics is the primary way
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.640]   of developing physical grace that is necessary
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.920]   to be a strong and attractive human being.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.000]   I think he makes a good argument.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:45.840]   I really appreciate it.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.600]   I have his, I keep his 11 and I go through,
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.880]   I think it was 11 or 12, I don't remember,
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.080]   but he goes through all these qualities
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.240]   and I go through it constantly and say,
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:55.240]   how am I doing on my own education for my children?
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:58.480]   I may not have my children at Le Rose,
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.080]   but I can still bring a Le Rose education to my children
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.000]   if at all possible.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.760]   And so athletics are an important thing.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.400]   You wanna be strong, you wanna be in great shape.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.040]   You want your children to be physically attractive.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.080]   Today's world, we could just put that under for men,
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.800]   the looks maxing movement.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.560]   Health, hygiene, style, personality, confidence,
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.760]   all of these things are important.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:21.320]   When I look back at myself as a young man,
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:22.680]   I didn't even, I never thought
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.400]   about my physical attractiveness.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.860]   Sounds ridiculous to say it,
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:27.680]   but I think a lot of people don't.
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:30.880]   Young men and maybe women do more, but as a man,
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.760]   most young men, I don't think much
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.160]   about physical attractiveness
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.520]   and yet physical attractiveness matters.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:40.160]   And physical attractiveness is something
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.160]   that will ultimately allow your child to have access
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:50.320]   to a broader pool of potential spouses
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.720]   than otherwise he or she would.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.080]   And it's everything.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.060]   So when you're spending money on your child's braces,
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.480]   that's a good move.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.760]   If you got weird teeth, my teeth,
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.960]   'cause I didn't wear my retainer,
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:04.200]   my teeth have gotten all crooked and it bothers me.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.240]   And so I'm probably gonna go ahead
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.520]   and start correcting mine here in the coming months
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.680]   and years and see if I can get them fixed.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.600]   And so it's, whether you're an adult
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.760]   or whether you're younger, if you've got weird teeth
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.780]   and they're all weird shaped, then get them fixed.
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:20.140]   We can get them fixed.
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:22.180]   Many aspects of physical health
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:25.520]   and physical beauty can be changed.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.520]   There's, you know, for men, well, for men and for women,
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.760]   one of the great problems that's facing our young people
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.120]   is they've got weird jaw formation.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.960]   And you've got all these like men and women
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.100]   who have these sunken faces and their jaws are all set back
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.400]   and they're not strong and handsome
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.560]   and confident and beautiful.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:45.000]   And there's a couple of things related to it.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.840]   First of all, some of it could be genetics.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.800]   A lot of it could be just related to the food
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.420]   that people are having, too many carbohydrates,
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:53.020]   too much sugar, even not enough chewy meat.
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:55.440]   So go ahead and buy the Greek gum
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.580]   and give it to your children to help them to chew a lot.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.520]   Feed chewy cuts of meat.
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.800]   Do mewing exercises to help your children
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.360]   to develop strong jaws, get proper orthodontia
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.540]   so that your children's faces are properly constructed.
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:12.000]   If you've got fat children, get them on fat.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.120]   If you have lots of acne, help them to stop.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.720]   I think that there's a,
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.060]   I've abandoned a philosophy that I used to have.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.880]   And the philosophy was this.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.920]   I don't think that we should judge people by circumstance.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.880]   So let me back up for a moment.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:31.040]   I don't believe that we should judge people
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.040]   by external traits that can't be controlled.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.800]   So if you meet a guy or a girl who has a really ugly face,
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.960]   I don't think that it's appropriate to judge that person
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.080]   for having an ugly face.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.600]   And I don't think that,
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.720]   and I don't think we should ever do that.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.880]   Beauty, the beauty that we most value
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.880]   should always be the beauty that comes from within,
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.240]   from virtue, from character, from an inner beauty,
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.440]   from an inner righteousness.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.440]   That's the beauty that we should value.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:06.080]   And so I don't want to go through life judging people
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.360]   based upon the beauty of someone's face.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.220]   On the other hand,
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:12.480]   I think it's entirely reasonable to judge people
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.700]   for circumstances they can control.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:17.380]   So if a man or woman is super fat,
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:20.460]   that can generally in almost all cases be controlled.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.280]   If someone is just ugly because of things
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.200]   that could be easily changed, right?
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.040]   Then maybe that's an appropriate place to say,
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.560]   this is saying something about your character.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.680]   The problem that I have is that I think that beauty
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.200]   is properly characterized as an expression of health.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.600]   And I changed my opinion on that a couple of years ago
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.680]   from reading the book that I promoted various times,
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.680]   and I'm blanking on the name and I'm blanking on the author,
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:51.160]   Dr. Catherine, someone or other.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:55.560]   And she convinced me that beauty
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.280]   is a pretty decent substitute for health,
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.600]   that the things that we call beautiful
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.360]   have to do with attractiveness and for health.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.000]   And I was talking with a friend of mine,
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.580]   and this friend has teenage daughters,
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.560]   and this friend is feeding her,
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.560]   they've chosen in their family to have an all,
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:19.280]   basically to be basically carnivore as a family.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.000]   And her daughters, I was admiring her teenage daughters,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000]   just had this beautiful, totally clear, glowing skin.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.840]   And she said, "Yeah, my daughters are the ones
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.680]   "who really want us to be on carnivore."
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.600]   Because they said that when they stopped being carnivore
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.760]   and they went back, they started to break out in acne,
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.760]   started to have these, they didn't like their skin,
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.000]   their skin wasn't in good shape.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.480]   And I thought even something as obvious as skin,
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.280]   you would say, well, the quality of my skin,
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.960]   whether or not I have acne or how much acne I have,
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.760]   I shouldn't judge somebody for that.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.800]   But in reality, it's probably a reflection
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:58.560]   in some degree of how healthy someone is.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:03.560]   And being, trying to attract a healthy and beautiful spouse
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.800]   is a smart move from a financial perspective,
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.480]   from a long-term planning perspective.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:14.280]   Health, beauty is an indicator of health,
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:17.400]   and health is something that is going to
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.400]   significantly reflect on the quality and satisfaction
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:27.080]   that you have in a marriage relationship.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.200]   And so this is something that should be optimized for.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:34.760]   When I married my wife, I made a commitment to her
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.520]   to have and to hold in sickness and in health,
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.240]   for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.020]   till death do us part.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:47.900]   In sickness or in health is a very big marital commitment,
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.620]   a very big vow.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:54.620]   If I were, once I marry her,
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:59.820]   I have a commitment to her that doesn't end
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.040]   until either she dies or I die.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:09.460]   That can be a very burdensome commitment to carry out.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:11.460]   We should always honor people
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:14.900]   who fulfill their marital vows to a sick spouse,
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:15.820]   to an ailing spouse.
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:18.540]   That's proper for us to honor those people,
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.440]   no question about it.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.440]   But you have a choice in who you marry.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:31.220]   You are never required to go into a marriage relationship
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.180]   by anybody else or any circumstance.
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.740]   You have a choice.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.180]   You don't have a choice after you're married.
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:42.380]   And when I reflect on the quality of my life
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:45.020]   and the satisfaction that I have with my wife
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.740]   and with our children,
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:50.860]   I realize how a significant component of that satisfaction
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:53.460]   is due to just basically having good health.
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:55.020]   I have good health, she has good health,
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.380]   we have healthy children.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.860]   It makes a big difference in my life.
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:02.060]   I would have a much harder time
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:05.420]   being as confidently approving of marriage
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:07.780]   being a great life decision.
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.860]   If I had a wife who was sickly,
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:12.680]   I had children who were sickly,
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.900]   it would be harder for me to express
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:19.900]   such an unhindered approbation of the quality of my life.
[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:22.740]   So breaking that back to the beginning,
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:26.180]   when I was in college and considering various girls
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:28.980]   that I was attracted to, I wasn't thinking about health.
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:32.540]   If you had told me I should be thinking about health,
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:34.580]   I probably would have said, oh, come on, that's no big deal.
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:35.540]   Love is love.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:37.300]   I'm just gonna fall in love with the girl who's right for me.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:38.360]   She's the one.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.100]   I didn't have very mature thinking on it.
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:44.180]   Today, I would do it very differently.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:47.300]   And today, I would tell my children, I do, I will,
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:49.260]   I do and will, that one of the things
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:52.060]   you need to screen your spouse for is health.
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:54.840]   And so all of us need to be as healthy as possible,
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.220]   as attractive as possible,
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.820]   as physically attractive as possible,
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.400]   because physicality, physical attractiveness,
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.340]   especially external physical attractiveness
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:04.460]   is closely related to health.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:07.860]   And you want to choose somebody who is healthy
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:11.420]   in order for you to have the highest probability
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:14.700]   of having a satisfying and enduring relationship.
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:20.020]   We want to help our children to be highly attractive
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.060]   so that they can attract
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:26.860]   as the most attractive potential spouse possible.
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:31.860]   Now, the key here is not to optimize for the wrong factors.
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:36.780]   So we don't want to optimize, for example, for promiscuity.
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:38.100]   That's not a goal.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:43.100]   We know that sexual promiscuity dramatically damages
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:47.280]   the long-term prospects of men and women to marry
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.020]   and their satisfaction with marriage.
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.980]   So we don't want to optimize for promiscuity.
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.540]   We want to optimize for marriage,
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:57.060]   not fornication, but marriage.
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:58.620]   That's the context for it.
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:00.940]   And so we should train for that
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.220]   and we should do everything possible
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:05.300]   to help our children develop attractiveness.
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:09.460]   All skills of attractiveness can be learned and developed.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:15.100]   Physical attractiveness is a skill.
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:16.660]   There are lots of component skills,
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.060]   component skills of eating, exercise,
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:23.100]   body sculpting, muscle building, et cetera.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.420]   These are skills that can be learned
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.100]   and can be put into place.
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:27.180]   I was young and dumb,
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:30.140]   and I always thought that this was kind of accidental.
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:32.980]   I watched this video this last week or a few couple days ago
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:34.620]   that really inspired me.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:36.380]   And it was a guy named,
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:39.040]   there's a YouTuber named Brandon Carter.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.160]   He's this dude, he's super buff,
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.300]   body of a Greek God type guy.
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:46.740]   And he's 40 years old.
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:50.300]   He's got this big platform and really attractive guy
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.300]   from a physical perspective.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:55.860]   I don't need to pull him down.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.620]   He's an attractive guy from a physical perspective.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:02.620]   He did this video where he shared how
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:06.100]   he travels the world with a food scale.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.460]   And literally, he travels the world
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:11.060]   and he weighs everything he eats.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:14.660]   And his point was, he says, I care about this result.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.100]   I'm not gonna leave it to chance.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.180]   So I weigh everything that I eat
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:21.300]   so I can properly log it in MyFitnessPal
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.500]   and make sure that I'm in a caloric deficit.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.960]   That video was inspiring to me
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.380]   because as a lifelong not physical guy,
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:30.540]   as a lifelong fat guy,
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:33.340]   when I was younger, I always thought it was accidental.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:36.140]   I thought that like the muscular guys,
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:37.780]   my friends with the great six pack
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.700]   and the really attractive shoulders and whatever,
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.580]   I thought, well, it just comes that way, right?
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:44.860]   It's all genetic.
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.700]   Nonsense, it's a lifestyle decision.
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.180]   And Brandon Carter travels the world with a food scale?
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:51.100]   I don't.
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.180]   He looks like that?
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.020]   I don't.
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:54.540]   And it was a good slap in the face
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.240]   that I needed to say like,
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.500]   yes, you're gonna be a weirdo
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.260]   and you're gonna be a weirdo by weighing your scale,
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:00.780]   weighing your food when you're traveling the world.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.780]   But if you want these results, this is what you gotta do.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.220]   And so similarly,
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:10.900]   so that's why I say that physical attractiveness is a skill.
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:14.060]   Carter has developed skills that I haven't yet developed.
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.240]   So if I want what Carter has,
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.740]   then I can develop skills that match Carter's
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:21.340]   and I'll get closer to what Carter has.
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:22.420]   That's the point.
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:25.200]   So physical attractiveness is a skill.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.300]   Personal confidence is a skill.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.780]   It's something that we need to teach
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.300]   to our sons and our daughters.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:32.900]   Teaching them personal confidence,
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.840]   helping them to develop personal confidence,
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:38.540]   helping them to develop an attractive personality.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:39.980]   Personality is simply a skill.
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:41.020]   It's not an innate thing.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:45.500]   Yes, there's an element of innate, like inherited qualities,
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.620]   but we can all develop personality.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:49.800]   I can turn on personality, I can turn it off.
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:50.640]   I can change it.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.720]   Learning charisma and all of these things
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:55.160]   that ultimately cause people to be attracted to us
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.000]   are skills.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.160]   And I think that if you'll take that
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.980]   and then think about how can I invest
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:02.640]   into helping my child to develop these skills,
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:05.640]   then you'll have a really great path to run on.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.440]   Young people need to have at least one thing
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:11.520]   that they feel really confident about.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.200]   Ideally, it's more than one,
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.680]   but at least one thing that they feel really confident about.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:17.920]   And you as a parent can nurture that,
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:20.840]   you can pay for that, you can help that to be acquired.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:25.440]   We also need to help our children know how
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.040]   to attract a spouse.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:31.700]   And I mean the actual actions to take to attract a spouse.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:37.440]   They need to learn how to market themselves effectively.
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.800]   So physicality is an expression,
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:41.840]   but learning how to dress in an attractive way.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.280]   Learning how to dress in a way
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.600]   that attracts the right kind of attention.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:49.720]   I think men get away with a lot more than women do
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:53.000]   in terms of if a guy is in good shape,
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.100]   he can kind of be a slob
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:56.080]   and a lot of girls will overlook that.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.680]   But the converse is not always true.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.120]   And so with our daughters,
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:02.200]   if you want your daughter
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.220]   to attract a very high quality man,
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:08.720]   then you need to proactively train her
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:11.200]   and teach her how to do that.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.080]   I don't yet have any teenagers,
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.080]   but here's my thought on teenagers.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:17.560]   I was interacting with a client of mine recently.
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.600]   We're talking about his 15 year old daughter
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.720]   who was going out and shopping for a dress
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:24.400]   to go to a school dance.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.240]   And he made these comments.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.760]   By the way, comments that anger Joshua,
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:29.720]   there's just a few of them.
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.940]   Number one is don't come at me with like,
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.860]   does your wife work?
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:34.600]   I think I talked about that earlier.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.120]   That one annoys me.
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.320]   Number two, don't come at me
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.360]   with any of this macho nonsense.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.440]   When my daughter gets,
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.000]   I'm gonna be sitting there cleaning my gun
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.680]   when the guy comes over and I'm gonna scare him off
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:49.080]   and I'm gonna scare off all her boyfriends.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:50.240]   I hate that.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:53.200]   And I don't like to be confrontational in real life.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:55.680]   There are a few things that I confront men on
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:56.920]   every single time I hear them,
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.080]   and that's one of them.
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.920]   Don't give me any of that macho nonsense
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:05.360]   about I'm gonna scare away my daughter's boyfriends
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.280]   and I'll talk about that when she's 30 years old.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.120]   You don't want that.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.440]   You want your daughter to have a boyfriend.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.520]   A really, really great one
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:18.760]   that you are thrilled to welcome into your family
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.360]   as a son-in-law.
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:24.220]   You want her to bring home a phenomenal man
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:26.080]   to interact with you and to join your family.
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.160]   That's what you're looking for.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.000]   You don't want her to be scared,
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.800]   you don't want to be some loser redneck
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.480]   sitting there cleaning your shotguns
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.800]   so she doesn't bring guys home to meet you.
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.200]   But what you want her to do
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.000]   is you want her to learn how to attract
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000]   the right kind of attention,
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.200]   not the wrong kind of attention.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:49.680]   And so you need to teach your daughter
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.560]   as a father, as a mother,
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.920]   you need to teach your daughter
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.280]   how to attract the right kind of attention,
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:58.160]   how to address in a way
[01:59:58.160 --> 01:59:59.880]   that's going to attract the eye
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.320]   of a really high-quality man,
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:04.080]   not a low-quality man.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.880]   And there's a skillset for that,
[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:07.440]   how to market yourself effectively,
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:09.640]   how to express your personality.
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:12.280]   So I have lots of detailed thoughts on that.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.480]   I just want to point it out to you
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:17.960]   that don't follow for these stupid tropes.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:20.040]   Think in advance and teach your daughter
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.200]   how to dress so that she can land
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.780]   a world-class husband.
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:26.200]   Because for her life and for her happiness
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:27.480]   and for her fulfillment,
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:30.000]   that will be an amazing thing for her.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.400]   And you want her to do that at 18, at 20, at 22.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.720]   Because at 18 and 20 and 22,
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:37.240]   she's got the pick of the litter
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:40.600]   in terms of number of high-quality spouses
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.960]   that she could attract.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:45.520]   And that's the best pathway for success,
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:49.400]   not for you to engage in some bozo, macho nonsense.
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.840]   And somehow then she's 35 years old
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:53.800]   and you've scared away all her boyfriends.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:54.640]   And now you say, all right, honey,
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:56.740]   you're 35 years old, you can go and marry.
[02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:00.120]   So attracting a spouse is a whole set of skills
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.240]   and you can invest into your children
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:03.740]   to help them to be attractive.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:08.040]   Selecting a spouse.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.960]   In terms of selecting a spouse
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.400]   to help form the foundation,
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.160]   you need to give thought to how your children
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:16.840]   are likely to meet a potential spouse.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.680]   When I was in college,
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.000]   I made fun of people who talked about the MRS degree,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.280]   the idea that a girl would go to college to land a husband.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:28.080]   I thought even at the time that it was a stupid joke.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:32.520]   And okay, maybe it reflected reality a long time ago,
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.420]   but it was just a stupid joke.
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.880]   I no longer think that.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:39.880]   I now think a very reliably good reason to go to college
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:43.720]   is to interact with a selection of carefully filtered,
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:45.760]   high quality men and women
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:49.020]   with hopes of potentially attracting a spouse.
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:51.560]   The thing I most value about my undergraduate degree
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.400]   is I met my wife, that's it.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.480]   And if I had to do it all over again,
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:58.200]   and that was the only thing I got out of college,
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:01:59.920]   I would do it all over again.
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:03.960]   The cool thing about colleges and other institutions
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:08.760]   are that you have the ability to bring together
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:15.120]   a very strong and highly concentrated pool
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:21.320]   of attractive people who are filtered based upon something.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.120]   In college, they're at least filtered
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.920]   based upon academic ability,
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:28.200]   which is strongly correlated to IQ.
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.780]   And you want your children to be smart.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:35.100]   And a lot of IQ is inherited from mother and father.
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:38.220]   So you want to marry someone with the highest IQ possible.
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:43.120]   Well, we don't give potential dates IQ tests,
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:46.380]   but the homogamy that is created in the college environment
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:51.380]   or the environment of college lends itself very well
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.980]   and makes itself highly suited for homogamous relationships.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:59.100]   And so college is a great screener of IQ.
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:02.220]   And it's one of the reasons we see a distinction
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:05.020]   and a separation of social classes in the United States
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:07.700]   is that more and more, all the smart people go to college
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:08.780]   and the dumb people don't.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:12.500]   And so you have these social classes
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:15.560]   that are separating themselves from each other.
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.460]   There may be other screens.
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.740]   I went to a Christian university.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:24.240]   The reason I did that, even though when I was 18 years old,
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.900]   was I said, you know what?
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.260]   If I go and sit down at the lunch table
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:29.180]   and introduce myself to five people,
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:32.840]   I want there to be a good, a strong chance
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.740]   that of the five, several of them would be people
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:37.920]   that I would want to be friendly with
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.300]   and be friends with on an ongoing basis.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:44.440]   And that philosophy served me well.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.600]   Given the chance to do it over again,
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:48.520]   I'd do it over again in a heartbeat.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.540]   I would not want to go to a government college
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:54.320]   and be where the applicants,
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.560]   I'm talking about IQ and I can't get my words out,
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:01.520]   where the applicants are screened for IQ
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.440]   and academic ability, but not screened to some degree
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.440]   for lifestyle or character qualities.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:13.660]   I don't want to be friends with the majority of the people
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:16.360]   at a lunch table in the government college.
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:17.880]   I'm more likely to want to be friends
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:20.480]   with the majority of people in the private institution
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.000]   or the Christian institution or something else
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.160]   where there's some kind of screening environment.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.240]   I'm not interested in going to keggers on the weekend.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:29.380]   I'm interested in people who are serious about life
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.220]   and serious about it.
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:32.080]   So you can screen for that based upon the kind
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:33.580]   of institution that you attend.
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:34.960]   So I think you should be careful
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:36.560]   and you should encourage people to do that.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:37.920]   And one of my concerns that I have
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.840]   with the current anti-college commentary
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.640]   that many people have, which is in many cases,
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:48.240]   probably rightly placed, meaning that college
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.060]   is not as valuable as it once was,
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:52.560]   is that there's a signaling component of college.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.360]   And so if you're a young man who could go to college
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:59.920]   and doesn't, you now have a significant barrier
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:04.000]   to overcome with a woman who could go to college and does.
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.120]   And we know in the data, on matchmaking data,
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.000]   that this is an important factor for women,
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.480]   and I think it's rightly important.
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.120]   It's not something that should be ignored.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.000]   Now, it can be overcome.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.720]   Any individual factor can be,
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.560]   but you should be careful about that.
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:21.640]   I believe as a parent that it's my responsibility
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.280]   to create a lifestyle for my teens
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:32.840]   that they have a broad exposure to many potential spouses.
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:37.120]   If you want to have grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:40.120]   take the responsibility seriously and recognize
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:42.880]   that it begins with, first and foremost,
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.840]   creating attractive children
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.840]   who have the character qualities,
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:50.080]   all of the things that will help them
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.640]   to be good husbands and wives.
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:56.640]   And then it's also a component of exposure.
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:59.800]   Finding a great spouse is an element
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:03.000]   of how many people are you exposed to
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.480]   and how attractively are you able
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:07.120]   to represent yourself to those people.
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:09.000]   It's just a numbers game.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.080]   There is no one person in the world who's right for you.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.040]   There is a person that you choose as your spouse
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:17.760]   that you're able to attract and that you had exposure to.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.600]   So in addition to the qualitative aspects
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:22.760]   of investing into your children to help your children
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.280]   to be as attractive of a potential husband
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.840]   or as attractive as a potential wife
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.080]   as you can help them to be,
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:30.240]   you want to expose them
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.400]   to the widest possible candidate pool.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.800]   And the question I always have,
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:36.040]   if a young man or young woman is talking to me
[02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:36.920]   and says, "I want to get married,"
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:40.680]   my question is, "How many women did you meet last month?
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:42.240]   "Tell me the number."
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.320]   And if a guy isn't meeting any women,
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.560]   then you know he's not serious about being married.
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:49.480]   And I always start my speech with,
[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:53.080]   "You need to develop yourself into being an attractive man."
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:55.320]   But the second component of that
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.760]   is how many women did you meet?
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.320]   And so as a parent, I think it's my responsibility.
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:02.320]   If I want my children to be married
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:03.920]   and I'm gonna take it seriously,
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:07.800]   then it's my responsibility to help them
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:12.300]   to have exposure to broad numbers of people.
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:14.640]   So you should look for social outlets for this.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:16.640]   Number one, this is a very good reason
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.800]   if there's a local school in your area,
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:22.120]   it may, even if it's an expensive local school,
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:23.680]   but the kind of people at it
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:26.000]   are the kind of people that would reflect your culture.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000]   This is a very good reason
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.560]   for you to pay expensive private school tuition
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.280]   so that your children are exposed to a peer group
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.640]   that would reflect your family's values,
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:36.160]   your family's social class,
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.240]   and the kinds of things that you do.
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:43.100]   Social class in today's world matters enormously.
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:46.320]   What has happened is if you look at some of the data,
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:49.640]   I've been reading Brad Wilcox's recent book on marriage.
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:51.400]   And what's so interesting, the point that he makes in that,
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.920]   and he's made it for years in his essays,
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:58.920]   is, excuse me, the point that is fascinating about it
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:04.400]   is that the higher social classes,
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:08.080]   and I'm measuring that based upon socioeconomic status,
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:09.520]   income and wealth,
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:13.860]   the higher social classes are the most likely classes
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:18.440]   to say that you can and should live however you want.
[02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:21.280]   So it'll be very unusual for you to find a rich person
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.680]   who will say, you should get married and stay married,
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.520]   and men and women should marry each other.
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:28.680]   On the contrary, wealthy people are very likely to say,
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:30.280]   hey, you live however you wanna live.
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:33.040]   You do you, man, you do you, right?
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:34.940]   That would be what they would say.
[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:37.800]   But in reality, their lifestyle decisions
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:39.580]   are the exact opposite of that.
[02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:42.040]   They get married, they stay married.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:45.180]   And the selection of a spouse is very, very important.
[02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:46.820]   So one of the things that's interesting
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:49.380]   is that if you look at the data,
[02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:52.700]   all of the upper class components,
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:55.580]   so for example, a couple that's married is,
[02:08:55.580 --> 02:08:59.620]   sorry, a couple with high educational achievement
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:04.900]   is more likely to be more religious.
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:07.260]   If you look at religious trends in the United States,
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:09.280]   the more highly educated someone is,
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.100]   the more likely they are to be religious.
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:14.680]   And the more enduring the marriage is.
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.360]   So these social class things that the wealthy people,
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:23.360]   they say one thing, but they're enforcing
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:28.360]   and reinforcing with their lifestyles something different.
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.640]   That's where we are.
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:32.660]   And so if you want your child to have access
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:36.200]   to a social class that encourages marriage,
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.200]   that's going to see it through,
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.880]   then you probably want to send your children
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.300]   to expensive religious schools
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:46.560]   because there's the highest exposure to people
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:49.040]   who are going to reflect those values.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:51.120]   And so spending money on that intentionally
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:54.120]   is a smart move, it's a good move.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.600]   In addition to schools,
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:58.000]   or if you don't have access to schools
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.320]   and things like that that are part of your choice,
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:01.840]   make sure that your children are exposed
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.280]   to a broad range of people their age.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:11.280]   And so one of my goal, my decisions is that,
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.140]   especially with teenagers,
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.240]   I will make certain that my children are involved
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.320]   in many social groups.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:19.240]   And it can be everything from a local camp
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:22.200]   that you love to attend, some kind of youth rally,
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.760]   or some political movement, or something like that.
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:27.720]   But your children need broad exposure to many people
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.840]   to have a high chance of them being exposed
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:31.660]   to different kinds of people
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:33.200]   so they can start to understand the kinds of people
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.880]   that they would be a good match for,
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.160]   but also have a high chance of meeting someone
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:39.960]   who is a good match from a natural perspective.
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:41.680]   And so you can spend money on that.
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:43.760]   So if you have young children as I do,
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:46.520]   plan to be spending lots of money on travel
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:49.040]   and on dues and organization fees
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.720]   and school expenses and things like that
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:52.240]   when your children are teenagers.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.340]   And hopefully that will continue through college and beyond
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:58.000]   if they haven't met somebody when they are a teen
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.060]   and initiated a relationship that might result in marriage.
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:04.240]   In terms of selection,
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:05.880]   we also wanna be super intentional
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:09.520]   about teaching our children what to look for
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:11.880]   in a high quality spouse.
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.760]   If you're listening to me at this point, however long,
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.240]   I'm over two hours into this podcast.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.160]   If you're listening to me,
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:18.800]   there's a good chance that you're married or wanna be.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:19.620]   But if you're married,
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:23.040]   you know what makes for a good relationship.
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.800]   You probably don't wanna say it,
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.440]   just like I don't always wanna put all my things out
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:27.400]   on the internet.
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:28.840]   You probably don't wanna put it in a tweet
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:30.320]   and wait for the mob to pile on you
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.600]   for your unacceptable opinions.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.520]   But you know the things that make for a good husband
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.840]   or a good wife.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.880]   You know the aspects of compatibility
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:41.000]   and the features to look for.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.080]   So train your children in that.
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:44.480]   Help them to be thinking about that.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.760]   Helping them to be looking out for those things.
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.160]   Earlier I was making fun of the bad boy complex.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:55.400]   It's so cliche and yet it's so true.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.400]   Women wanna be attracted to the man,
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.640]   and I know he's not good for me,
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.280]   but I'm just so into him.
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:01.960]   This is stupid behavior.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:03.940]   Teach your daughters not to do it.
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:06.720]   Think with your brain, not with your emotions,
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:09.120]   and control your emotions with your brain.
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:12.720]   Emotions are important, but they are a stupid master.
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:14.400]   So teach your children that.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.000]   Teach your children to be questionable
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.120]   when they're attracted to someone
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:20.300]   who's clearly not a good fit for them.
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:23.440]   Teach them about the character clues to look for.
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.600]   So I've shared some of them,
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:29.400]   but no complaints to my parents, I appreciate that.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.480]   But I've got a long list of things
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:32.560]   that I wanna make sure my children
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.780]   are looking for in the world.
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.760]   Everything from physical health, I've already described.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.840]   I never thought to look for physical health.
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:40.640]   And maybe if I had been interested in a girl
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.460]   who wasn't healthy,
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:43.100]   I bet my parents would have said something.
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:45.000]   But by that time, it's too long and too late.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.680]   And we're living in a world in which in our current moment,
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:52.960]   young people are, as best I can tell,
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:57.640]   there's not a strong cultural movement towards analysis.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:59.500]   What I mean is that you're expected to be attracted
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:01.240]   to somebody no matter what, and it's just in you.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.080]   Your sexual attractions and your romantic attractions,
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.160]   they're these innate things that you can't control
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:07.720]   and you just are who you are.
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:09.200]   And people make stupid decisions
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:10.840]   because of this mindset and this philosophy.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:13.280]   And they go out into the world thinking that this is true,
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.580]   and then they screw up their lives.
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:18.180]   So I think that's dumb, and we can do better.
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:21.000]   So let's train our children, and we have the data.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.940]   Any one of us can invite a marriage therapist
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:24.080]   over for dinner and say,
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.600]   "Hey, marriage therapist who talks to hundreds of couples
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.700]   "who are in the process of divorcing,
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:30.120]   "what are the things that you're teaching
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:31.280]   "your children to do?"
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.000]   And we can have that conversation and we can learn
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.640]   about what not to do.
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:38.020]   All the research is there available for us.
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:42.320]   And that's why it annoys me that so many men especially,
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:44.640]   but men are scared of marriage 'cause they somehow think
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.920]   that a 50% divorce rate is accidental.
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:48.480]   It's not an accidental statistic.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:50.880]   It can be controlled based upon good decisions
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.240]   at every level of this.
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:57.860]   Selecting a spouse, teach your children to select.
[02:13:57.860 --> 02:13:59.820]   Now, marrying the spouse, okay?
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:03.440]   Marrying the woman, marrying the man.
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:06.980]   We used to have strong social pressure in favor of marriage
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:09.320]   before sexual activity and before children.
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.280]   That social pressure is basically gone.
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.440]   We need to bring it back on a consistent basis.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:22.200]   Sexuality outside of marriage causes enormous destruction.
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:26.880]   Sexuality within marriage causes enormous happiness.
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:30.560]   You may not be able to control the broader culture
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.400]   of your country.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.360]   I can't control the broader culture of my country,
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.700]   but we can control the culture of our family.
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:41.020]   And we can teach children soberly
[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:44.740]   the facts about marriage and sexuality.
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:47.260]   And we need to be very clear.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:51.660]   The data on this is strong in terms of the damaging impact
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:54.460]   that promiscuous sexuality has
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:56.780]   on long-term relationship satisfaction.
[02:14:56.780 --> 02:15:03.740]   Similarly, marriage at one point in our cultures
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:07.420]   was strongly supported by communities.
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:10.180]   It can be strongly supported again.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:13.440]   We may not be able to fix the tragedy of no-fault divorce
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:16.220]   in the United States of America, probably not,
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:20.060]   but we can still provide the social support
[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:22.280]   for marriage in our communities.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:26.180]   If somebody is, and I'm not gonna go through
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:28.500]   step-by-step how to do it, but it has to be done.
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.320]   It has to absolutely be done.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:37.760]   There are always people in the top 20% of couples
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:40.580]   who are gonna sail into marriage and sail through marriage
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:42.340]   and have no problem whatsoever,
[02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:46.100]   and they need no community support for marriage whatsoever.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:48.980]   There's probably always gonna be a bottom 20% of people
[02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:50.700]   who no amount of community support,
[02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:52.500]   no amount of counseling, no amount of,
[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.740]   they're just broken people who their marriages
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:57.460]   are destined to fail catastrophically.
[02:15:57.460 --> 02:16:01.020]   It's the middle 60% that we should be concerned about.
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:03.500]   And the strong social pressure
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.900]   to be cautious before marriage,
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:07.360]   and then to maintain marriage,
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:11.540]   we can keep a significant portion of that middle 60%
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:15.100]   of marriages intact and time for the emotions to dissipate
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.480]   and for people to realize, you know what,
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:17.860]   we're better off together.
[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:20.460]   And so to the extent that you have influence
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:23.380]   in your community, learn to support marriage
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:26.220]   so we can work with that 60% and improve that.
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:27.740]   It's really important.
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:30.460]   Financially speaking, we need to pull apart
[02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:35.460]   the different components of marrying someone
[02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:39.140]   and see how they can be financially supported.
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:42.220]   The first component is attractiveness,
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:46.180]   meaning is he a moneymaker?
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.440]   Can he provide for me if you're a woman?
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:52.860]   Women care about how much money men earn.
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:56.260]   And I believe that that is right and they should.
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:59.140]   Men don't have the same consideration.
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:02.780]   Men do not generally care how much money a woman earns.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:04.780]   And the kind of man who cares about how much money
[02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:07.140]   a woman earns is probably not the kind of man
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:10.940]   who wants to have children and build a family,
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:12.380]   build a legacy.
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:15.740]   So we have to separate this based upon men and women.
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:22.900]   But it's right for men to be expected to be earners.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:25.400]   And in a moment, I'll talk about how to facilitate that.
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:28.580]   But the first thing is how to signal that appropriately.
[02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:30.260]   There needs to be a strong indication
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:31.740]   that this man is a good earner
[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:35.900]   and there needs to be some measure of his wealth.
[02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:37.260]   I didn't intend for this podcast
[02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:39.100]   to become the beast that it's become,
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:44.100]   but at its core, there needs to be financial disclosure,
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.380]   but at the proper time.
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:48.260]   And so a man needs to be earning enough
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:52.300]   and there should be an indication of financial stability.
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:53.740]   Now, the traditional way
[02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:57.020]   that a man showed his financial attractiveness
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:00.820]   in many cultures was doing things like having a home,
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:02.580]   having a job, having a house,
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:04.500]   preparing something for his wife,
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:06.920]   preparing a life to bring his bride into.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:10.820]   In our current time, most of that has gone away
[02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:13.340]   in just favor of an engagement ring.
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:17.380]   And an engagement ring is probably important
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:21.800]   in terms of a signal or a token of a man's ability.
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:24.060]   So I'm not the guy who's telling you
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:27.900]   to buy a ring from a bubblegum machine and give it out.
[02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:29.140]   Because there's an element
[02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:32.300]   at which a man demonstrates his worth for his bride
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:34.540]   and demonstrates his ability to provide
[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:36.920]   based upon some external thing,
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:40.300]   some bubble, some proof of it.
[02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:41.720]   We don't have a dowry system,
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:44.120]   but finances have always been an important component
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:46.840]   of marriage throughout history, and they still are.
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:49.380]   However, I would say an engagement ring
[02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:52.720]   should probably be less important than a debt-free house.
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:54.240]   So finding an ability to say,
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.600]   "Hey, here's a debt-free house,"
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:59.680]   that should probably take priority over an engagement ring.
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.280]   So consider and make sure
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:06.280]   that we are choosing signals of financial ability
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:07.440]   that are appropriate
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:11.680]   for the long-term success of the couple.
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.960]   Weddings should be funded by the community, not the couple.
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:18.960]   A huge impediment right now to marriage
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:21.000]   is the cost of a wedding.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.120]   Well, duh, if you're a young couple
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:26.080]   and you think that it's your job somehow
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:27.240]   to throw an enormous party
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:30.160]   so all your guests can get drunk on your dime,
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:32.080]   you can't afford that.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.880]   Weddings should be a community affair.
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:36.480]   And what has happened is we've broken our communities,
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.480]   we've approved men and women shacking up together,
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:44.580]   and then we've somehow said that that's okay,
[02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:45.600]   and then in 10 years,
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:47.740]   after you've shacked up together for 10 years,
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:49.720]   then we'll come to the party that you throw.
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:51.400]   That's not the way it is.
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:53.960]   The community that a person is involved in
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:56.520]   has always been an important component of marriage.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:00.480]   So the community enforces proper social order
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:03.800]   by expecting marriage as a prerequisite for sex.
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.440]   And then the community comes together
[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:07.980]   and ideally should create the wedding
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:10.040]   so that the couple can make their commitments,
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.640]   make their public vows one to another,
[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:12.840]   and the community supports that.
[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.800]   And that's a fundamentally important part
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:16.560]   of community stability.
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:21.560]   So as a parent who is looking to invest into your children,
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:26.920]   I think it's right for you to consider paying for weddings.
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:30.560]   And that's a proper and right expression of money.
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:32.240]   You can figure out how much it is.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:36.560]   My point in this podcast is simply to show
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:38.600]   that if you desire to help your children
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:40.260]   to get married and have children
[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:41.840]   and to do it at a young enough age
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:44.720]   so that we can change some of these fertility rate problems,
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:48.840]   then paying for weddings is a reasonable goal.
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.360]   It should also be reasonable
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:52.960]   that if you yourself don't have the financial capacity
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:56.040]   for it, that you have a community that can do it,
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:57.740]   that have a community that can come together,
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.480]   can have a great big potluck after church,
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:02.240]   have a great big potluck in the park
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:04.960]   and throw a wedding, throw a party for someone.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:07.480]   If you want, if you, as I do,
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:10.280]   if you are a man or a woman in your community
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:14.720]   and you want to see marriages built and be strong,
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:19.720]   and you want to see all of the good things
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.520]   that come from that, then you need to be willing
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:25.640]   and I need to be willing to do some of the work
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.680]   to support that and not just sit by
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:29.920]   and poke fingers at statistics,
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:33.340]   but do the work to support couples in that.
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:35.000]   That's our responsibility.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.160]   Also in terms of marriage,
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:42.080]   financial impediments to marriage must be limited.
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:43.800]   The biggest financial impediment to marriage
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:46.480]   is student loan debt or some other form of debt,
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:48.440]   but student loans are the big one.
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:53.440]   If my daughter is going or my son is going
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:56.440]   and gonna marry a woman and he finds out
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:59.400]   that she's got $150,000 of student loan debt
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:03.000]   for a non-high income producing career,
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.240]   I'm gonna strongly encourage him
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:08.080]   that this is an enormous negative factor.
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:12.900]   I wouldn't say it's an ultimately disqualifying factor
[02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:16.360]   of anything really, 'cause all of these factors,
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.120]   they need judgment and ability.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.240]   I don't think that just having,
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:22.280]   oh, this is absolutely disqualifying is the case.
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:25.680]   There's very few of those, but it's an enormous red flag
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.800]   and if he marries her, it will be an enormous impediment
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.800]   to their life for the coming years.
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:33.320]   Same thing both ways.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:37.000]   So be aware, be very cautious of student loan debt
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.400]   and teach your children to be very cautious of it
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.600]   and if possible, I mean, sorry,
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:43.120]   student loan debt can always be avoided.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:45.720]   There's always a way and in most cases,
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:47.880]   avoiding it is the right move.
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:51.640]   Now, some specific suggestions for young men
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:55.600]   and how we can help our young men to be prepared.
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:57.760]   We need to optimize and rethink
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:23:01.920]   our entire educational system and income generation
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:03.480]   of the system that we have right now
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.400]   and help our young men to optimize education
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:09.360]   and income generation at an early age.
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:10.840]   One of the big problems that we have
[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.760]   is I think marriages generally work best
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:16.800]   if a couple is close in age.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:20.640]   So we don't want to have a 40-year-old son
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:22.640]   who's marrying a 20-year-old daughter.
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.800]   That's not ideal.
[02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:26.160]   Much better to have a 23-year-old son
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:29.080]   marrying a 23-year-old girl, excuse me.
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:32.600]   Son and daughter was not what I intended to say.
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:34.760]   We don't want a 40-year-old man marrying a 20-year-old girl
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:35.920]   if it can be avoided.
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.600]   We want 23-year-olds to marry, 25-year-olds to marry,
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:39.560]   20-year-olds to marry.
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:42.800]   We want people to marry in an age bracket
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.560]   where they're similar to one another.
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:48.920]   The problem is that if a man is expected to provide
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.760]   and be wealthy and established
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:53.080]   and able to make lots of money,
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:56.320]   then generally he needs some time to make that happen.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:58.600]   And so it's a very unusual 20-year-old
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:02.800]   who is able to financially attract a girl.
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:05.280]   It's much more likely that he'd be 30 or 35
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:08.000]   when he's able to attract a high-quality girl.
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.720]   On the flip side, we want our daughters to be attracted
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:13.440]   to men who can provide for them.
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:16.200]   The problem is that the man who can provide for her
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:18.160]   is probably not gonna be able to do that
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:20.760]   until after a decade of working,
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:23.520]   of earning and making money.
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:26.600]   And she's probably gonna be significantly past
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:29.040]   her prime fertile years able to have children.
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.040]   And this is the numeric problem
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.200]   that couples are facing right now.
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:35.480]   That a woman's highest period of fertility
[02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:38.440]   comes from middle teenage years and into 20s.
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:39.880]   By the time she's 30 years old,
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.800]   she's lost 90% of her eggs.
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:44.840]   Her pregnancies are likely to be more challenging.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:47.440]   And every year that goes by into her 30s,
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:48.880]   it becomes more difficult.
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.880]   So it's very difficult to start having babies
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:53.200]   at 30 years old and have six of them by 40.
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:54.880]   That's pretty rough.
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:58.480]   It's much easier to start at 20 and have six babies by 40
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:00.400]   without it being a major problem.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:01.960]   But the problem is how does a 20-year-old
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:06.960]   select a high-quality man who's also 20 years old?
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:09.920]   So we need to work on this.
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:11.340]   And there's a couple aspects to it.
[02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:15.840]   Number one, a lot of our current delayed marriage
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:18.680]   is due to very high educational requirements
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:20.840]   for our current society.
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:22.920]   And these educational requirements are fine.
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:23.760]   They are what they are.
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:26.480]   They're real, they're important.
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:29.280]   And we can't just toss them aside
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:32.000]   and say that we don't need them anymore.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.720]   They are important and we need to pay attention to them
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:36.800]   because at the end of the day,
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:39.040]   it's good to be highly educated.
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.880]   But we also need some alternative methods.
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:44.780]   So first, we can put a lot of education,
[02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:47.840]   much more education into the teenage years
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:49.620]   than we currently do.
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:52.660]   But we also need to put education and income generation
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:54.300]   into the teenage years.
[02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:58.380]   A lot of educational time is wasted with frivolity.
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:02.260]   And while I'm a fan of being in a classroom dynamic
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:04.180]   where you can meet potential spouses,
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:06.100]   a lot of it is a waste of time.
[02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:09.120]   And so the emphasis that I'm trying to say is
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:11.440]   we need to help young men to be earning money
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.160]   at an earlier age so they can build confidence
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.440]   in their earning abilities and start building skills
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.640]   that will pay off significantly for them
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:21.080]   in the fullness of time.
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:22.840]   Now, I think this is one big reason
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:24.440]   why the United States really shines here.
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:26.680]   In many countries, young people can't even work
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:28.080]   until they're age 18.
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:31.360]   In the United States, 13 or 14 or 15 in most states,
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.800]   you can work and generate gainful employment.
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:36.900]   So that's good to have job experience.
[02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:39.100]   I have lots of thoughts on what that should look like
[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:41.340]   for teenagers, but the point is it's good
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:46.140]   and that there's job opportunities for teenagers.
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.980]   Teenagers need to go after them.
[02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:50.660]   And it's a balance because education is important,
[02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:53.260]   hobbies and avocations are probably also important,
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:54.980]   but earning ability is important.
[02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:57.700]   And a man who's been earning money for himself
[02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:59.300]   and paying for his own bills
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:01.460]   is going to have a much higher degree of confidence
[02:27:01.460 --> 02:27:02.760]   and is gonna have the confidence
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:05.680]   that he could support a wife if he needed to
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:06.960]   and if he chose to.
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:10.240]   So I think that we should not extend childhood like we do
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:12.940]   until a very late age by extending schooling out
[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:14.640]   for long, long periods of time,
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:16.640]   but let's compress those things a little bit
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:19.400]   and let's recognize that they can be done side by side.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:21.640]   Young men should be productive in their teen years
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.840]   while also becoming highly educated.
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:28.640]   In addition, young men should be taught by you and by me
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:31.180]   to be serious about their finances.
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:34.200]   Young men should be establishing their financial base
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:38.440]   with an eye towards optimizing for marriage and children,
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:40.380]   not necessarily optimizing
[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:43.280]   towards maximum net worth or frivolity.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.640]   My regret of my teenage years
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:48.760]   is that I engaged in too much frivolity
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:52.040]   and I did a lot less frivolity than a lot of people,
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:53.900]   but there are other pathways.
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:56.600]   Years ago, I interviewed Steve Maxwell on the show
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:59.440]   and I liked his sons, sorry, his book.
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:02.540]   He has a book called "Raising Our Sons
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:05.220]   to Buy Debt-Free Houses," something like that.
[02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:07.200]   And what he showed in that book
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:09.420]   from his personal family experience
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:13.680]   was that all of his sons were able to,
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:16.360]   with their own labor and their own savings,
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:20.260]   all of his sons were able to buy and pay cash
[02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:24.780]   for an individual single family home prior to marriage,
[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:27.340]   in some cases as early as I think late teenage years,
[02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:31.020]   18, 19, some of them early 20s, but prior to marriage.
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:34.460]   Now, this was in the context of a town in Kansas,
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:37.700]   so lower cost of living than some other places,
[02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:39.420]   but that should factor into it.
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:41.940]   And so interestingly, his sons all married
[02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:44.820]   and his sons all have various grandchildren.
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:47.780]   And so you can see the connection between that,
[02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:52.780]   that that was a good and proper move for them.
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:55.580]   And I don't see why more of us shouldn't do that.
[02:28:56.820 --> 02:28:59.060]   Children and teenagers,
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:01.660]   let me just use the word adolescence 'cause not children.
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:05.380]   I don't want children to work for money necessarily.
[02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:07.780]   Adolescents and teenagers can work for money
[02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:10.900]   and they can save money and we can teach them to do that.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:13.540]   And so you can either teach your child
[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:18.260]   to spend all of his money on mindless consumerism,
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:20.340]   or you can teach your child to have the goal
[02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:24.420]   of buying a debt-free house by the time he gets married.
[02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:26.460]   And your child will probably achieve the goals
[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:29.760]   that you teach him to accomplish, teach him to go for.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.460]   So pay attention to that and recognize
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:36.360]   that these are worthy things that can be done.
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:41.140]   So let's help young men to be more serious at a young age
[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:45.820]   and that way they can be more established
[02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:49.320]   and more attractive to a high-quality potential wife
[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:52.020]   at a younger age instead of having to wait
[02:29:52.020 --> 02:29:56.400]   until he's 30 or 35 years old to be able to attract her
[02:29:56.400 --> 02:29:58.740]   'cause that's a major problem
[02:29:58.740 --> 02:30:01.860]   of our current fertility rate crisis.
[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:05.420]   It's not as severe as the other factor though,
[02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.660]   which involves our young women.
[02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:12.180]   One of the enormous problems
[02:30:12.180 --> 02:30:15.220]   in the current declining fertility
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:20.140]   is that women are waiting significant amounts of time
[02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:21.660]   before having babies.
[02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:25.660]   All of the reasons that they're waiting make sense.
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:30.160]   But they're all culturally induced reasons.
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:33.960]   If you look at the kind of normal expected strategy
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:37.800]   of a young woman today, normally speaking,
[02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:41.640]   a young woman is going to be strongly encouraged
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:45.640]   to finish high school before having a baby.
[02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:49.680]   And so one of the enormous declines,
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:51.600]   let me read from an article here,
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:53.380]   I'll read from an ABC News article.
[02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:56.240]   (clears throat)
[02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:59.300]   So this ABC News article on the current fertility rate,
[02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:01.160]   talking about how there's a significant decline
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:02.280]   and I'll start here.
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:06.600]   Aside from an increase in teen births in US
[02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:09.800]   fall to record low as overall total rate drops by 2%.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:11.320]   So this is the same article that I just,
[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:13.900]   or the same data that I led the show with,
[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:16.680]   but we're talking about another factor of it.
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:24.180]   In 2023, there were 3.59 million births recorded,
[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:28.420]   a 2% decline from the 3.66 million recorded in 2022,
[02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:30.620]   a 2% decline year over year,
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:32.740]   according to the report from the CDC.
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.660]   This follows what has been a general decline
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:36.700]   since the mid-2010s.
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:39.660]   Between 2015 and 2020, the number of births fell
[02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:43.380]   an average of 2% per year from 2015 to 2020,
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:47.100]   including a decline of 4% from 2019 to 2020.
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:52.820]   Skipping on, aside from an increase in 2006 and 2007,
[02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:54.780]   the teen birth rate in the United States
[02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:57.960]   has been continuously declining since 1991.
[02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:01.540]   From 2007 through 2023, rates for younger teens,
[02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:05.680]   ages 15 to 17, and older teens, ages 18 to 19,
[02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:08.500]   declined by 8% and 6% per year,
[02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:10.740]   respectively, the report found.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:13.300]   Reasons for the decline in teen pregnancy are not clear,
[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:15.660]   but the CDC says evidence suggests
[02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.260]   it's due to a mix of more teens
[02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:19.100]   abstaining from sexual activity
[02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:22.380]   and more sexually active teens using birth control.
[02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:24.380]   Birth rates also declined for women
[02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:29.300]   between ages 20 to 29 and ages 30 to 39.
[02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:32.380]   For preteens and teens between ages 10 and 14
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:34.020]   and women aged 40 and older,
[02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:38.340]   rates were relatively unchanged from 2022 to 2023.
[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:39.940]   So here we have the story
[02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:42.680]   of declining birth rates in words.
[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:46.740]   Now, none of us want preteens to be having babies.
[02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:48.300]   None of us do.
[02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:51.180]   Most of us don't want teens to be having babies.
[02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:56.180]   I would like to offer just a small qualification of that
[02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:59.280]   to say that I think it'd be lovely
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:01.620]   if 18-year-old girls have babies,
[02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:02.900]   19-year-old girls have babies.
[02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:04.460]   I think that's fantastic.
[02:33:04.460 --> 02:33:07.020]   I have a friend of mine who they,
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:09.220]   he and his wife, now wife,
[02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:12.180]   conceived their first three babies out of wedlock
[02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:14.580]   starting when she was, I think, 17,
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:16.740]   and they wound up having six babies
[02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:18.420]   and built it into a great family
[02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:21.500]   and everything has worked out.
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:24.800]   I am never one to encourage premarital sex
[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:28.060]   or pregnancy outside of marriage.
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:30.220]   The data would indicate, though,
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:31.740]   regardless of what I would say about it,
[02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:36.740]   that this is an important source of births for a society.
[02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:39.240]   If you look at the fertility rates
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:42.220]   and reproduction rates throughout Latin America,
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:47.220]   the decline in unexpected unwanted teen pregnancy
[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:51.820]   has resulted in a huge component
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:53.460]   of the collapse of birth rates.
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:59.300]   Previously, prior to widespread contraception,
[02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:04.300]   previously, the unexpected unintended teen births
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:09.020]   made an enormous component
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:11.400]   in overall Latin American fertility.
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:17.040]   Today, due to the collapse of unintended teen pregnancies,
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:20.160]   the total fertility rate in much of Latin America
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:21.740]   has broadly collapsed.
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:25.820]   This is one of those paradoxes
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:28.480]   where I'm acknowledging the numerical truth
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:31.520]   without endorsing the societal dysfunction
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:34.480]   that we don't want teens to be having babies
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:35.640]   outside of wedlock.
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:36.880]   That is not the goal.
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:39.240]   But those babies outside of wedlock
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:42.520]   actually had a positive effect on total fertility rate.
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.960]   And that positive effect is now significantly declined.
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:48.920]   But back to the kind of the normal course
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:51.560]   of a young woman's life in today's world.
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:52.480]   It'd be very normal to say,
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:53.640]   "You need to finish high school."
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:55.320]   Okay, 18 years old.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.560]   Then for most people,
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:59.400]   especially from an audience like mine,
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:01.680]   most of us would say, "Well, you need to go to college."
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:03.200]   And today, women are going to college
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.920]   at enormously high rates.
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:07.760]   And very few women want to get married
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.360]   and very few women want to have children
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:11.480]   until they get out of college.
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:13.680]   I think we should question that assumption, by the way,
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:16.320]   which I'll come back to in a moment, but that's the case.
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:19.640]   So now she's probably gonna be 22 or 23 years old.
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:22.440]   Then the entire purpose of going to college
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:27.440]   for most young women is to prepare themselves for a career.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:29.960]   And so therefore, she needs to go on and get a career
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:33.560]   and she needs to establish herself in a career
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:35.040]   before having babies.
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:38.360]   In many cases, not necessarily before getting married,
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:41.320]   although marriages and relationships,
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:43.840]   it's not that easy for modern women
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:46.040]   to nail down a guy into a marriage.
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:48.160]   There's a whole lot of women living in relationships
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:51.360]   of various undefined forms, situationships,
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:52.960]   whatever it's called.
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:54.660]   So it's not as easy as it once was
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:57.800]   for a woman to get married,
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:35:59.880]   even though she'd be an attractive girl
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:03.320]   because the whole dating marketplace has changed.
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:05.440]   The point is that in many women's minds
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:06.560]   and in their ideal timing,
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:09.760]   she's going to establish herself in her career,
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:13.720]   which probably takes about a decade from say 23 to 33.
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:16.840]   Now, if she's able to find a high quality guy,
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:19.920]   enormous question there related
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:23.200]   to a woman's basic hypergamous tendencies
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.860]   to want to marry someone who is her superior,
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:28.640]   if she's gonna find a guy that she's willing to accept,
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:30.720]   and if she's able to convince him to marry,
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:33.060]   which is difficult in today's world,
[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:36.480]   then that often puts her at say 30 something
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:37.960]   before having babies,
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:40.680]   which means there's not generally much time
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:41.920]   for her to have babies.
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:45.160]   And this is especially acute
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:50.160]   given how difficult the load can be on her
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:53.300]   is that is her husband ideally,
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:56.380]   is her husband even gonna be willing to support her?
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:36:57.320]   What's the cost gonna be
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:58.680]   for her walking away from her career?
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:01.160]   It's enormous financial cost for a young woman
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:03.100]   who has dedicated 20 years of her life
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:04.900]   to preparing herself for a career,
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:06.860]   and now she's supposed to walk away from that
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:11.640]   when all of her social clout and value
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:14.740]   is being expressed based upon her earning ability.
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:17.860]   That's a significant challenge for a young woman.
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:23.880]   So we need to change various aspects of this,
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.220]   and we need to do it intentionally.
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:30.220]   The first thing is we need to optimize for motherhood
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:33.780]   without neglecting the possibility of the contrary.
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:35.720]   I find it challenging to figure out
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:37.120]   how to express these things appropriately,
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:39.720]   so you're gonna have to listen carefully.
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:42.440]   We need to optimize for motherhood
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:46.000]   without neglecting or harming our young women
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.680]   who may not ultimately turn out to be mothers.
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:51.300]   That's a challenge.
[02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:52.140]   So there are some people
[02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:54.500]   who would take an extreme form on these views.
[02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:56.480]   You would have an extreme feminist form
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:57.600]   that would say you don't need to be a mother,
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:58.440]   you don't need a man,
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.220]   so let's just optimize everything for career.
[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:01.520]   You go, boss babe.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.940]   Then there might be a very fundamentalist
[02:38:03.940 --> 02:38:06.660]   religious backlash that says we don't care about careers,
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:07.540]   you just need to have a mother.
[02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:10.420]   We want you to have as many babies as you possibly can.
[02:38:10.420 --> 02:38:13.620]   I am very uncomfortable with either of these extremes.
[02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:16.640]   It does not seem right to me that in our current society,
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.900]   women not be prepared to live independent lives.
[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:23.980]   Marriage does not happen for all men and women,
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:26.340]   and so therefore, as a father,
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:30.800]   I think I have a responsibility to prepare my daughter
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:35.800]   to be strongly equipped if she is single for her lifetime.
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:43.960]   And so we don't want to neglect proper academic preparation,
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.920]   proper career preparation.
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:50.920]   I don't think that the kind of fundamentalist extremist,
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:52.520]   women shouldn't go to college line
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:54.880]   is appropriate in most cases.
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:56.800]   We know from the data that highly educated women
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:58.740]   have the most enduring marriages.
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:39:02.220]   I appreciate being married to a very smart woman.
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:04.360]   I don't care about, it's one of those things
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:06.440]   where it's not the college degree that makes a difference,
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:08.880]   but the fact that she would go to college
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.280]   and is capable of going to college is to me important.
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:12.760]   I would have a very hard time
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:15.160]   being married to an ignorant woman.
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:17.520]   I would be a very hard time being married to a woman
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:19.840]   who was not my intellectual equal
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:22.760]   if we make weird grammar jokes with one another,
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:24.960]   and that would, if I couldn't do that,
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:26.560]   it would be frustrating.
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:28.320]   So I want to be married to a smart woman.
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:30.240]   But what I appreciate very much about my wife
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:34.720]   is that her entire ambition was not related to her career.
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:37.920]   So we want to optimize for motherhood
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:39.320]   without neglecting the possibility
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:42.560]   of non-motherhood, non-marriage.
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:45.220]   So because the standard approach
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:48.260]   is not optimizing for motherhood in any way
[02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:52.560]   due to that long train, again, go to college,
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.200]   don't get married till after college, build your career,
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.160]   and start thinking about children when you're 33,
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:00.560]   that doesn't work for long-term fertility.
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.800]   And many 30-year-old, 35-year-old women
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:04.840]   are having a much harder time having babies
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:07.120]   than they thought they would at the time
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:08.960]   because they were poorly educated.
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.800]   And then in addition, it's basically impossible
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:18.120]   to expect young men and women to be sexually chased
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:22.720]   as sexual adults for 15 or 20 years.
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:25.460]   And so this is creating all kinds of toxic problems
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:27.240]   in the marriage marketplace.
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:30.940]   And so if a girl has not been sexually chased
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:33.880]   and she goes to college and she's had this boyfriend,
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:36.000]   that boyfriend, this boyfriend, the other boyfriend,
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.860]   then now her ability to attract a very high-quality husband
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:42.760]   is severely diminished based upon this lifestyle.
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:44.520]   And again, a lot of girls finding this out
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:47.120]   and it's very sad, it ought not to be so.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:49.240]   So we've got problems for men and problems for women
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:52.280]   and we have to work within this.
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:54.580]   We have to solve this for the next generation.
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:58.040]   High levels of education and career ambition
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:02.040]   are generally less important to men and potential husbands,
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.520]   meaning your wife having high levels of education
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:08.520]   and career ambition is generally not so important
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:10.520]   to men who wanna be husbands.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:14.760]   It is often important to women, the women themselves,
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:16.640]   but it's not important to men.
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:19.000]   In addition, a lot of things related
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.760]   to our professionalization of society
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:22.280]   are causing enormous problems.
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:26.120]   Women having high-paying jobs leads to lower fertility.
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:29.220]   Men having high-paying jobs leads to higher fertility.
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:31.000]   So I think that college is a great place
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.760]   for a woman to meet a high-quality, ambitious man.
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:35.340]   Well, we've gotta figure out if there's some ways
[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:38.120]   that we could change the educational and career curve
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:41.000]   that would create more options for women
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.960]   and create options for them to have babies
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:46.720]   without feeling like that's the only thing,
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:48.980]   that's the only thing that they can have.
[02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:51.440]   So I go back to the teenage years.
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:55.320]   Can we have more educational accomplishment
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:57.520]   for young women during their teenage years?
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:41:59.000]   Can we speed up education?
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.200]   I think we have to, or we're not gonna survive as a society.
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:05.820]   The data, again, our collapsing birth rates are so clear.
[02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:09.240]   Highly educated women are not perpetuating themselves,
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:12.240]   generally speaking, if they're marrying later in life.
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:14.920]   There's lots of mothers who are highly educated,
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:17.920]   but generally what's happening is they are becoming,
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:20.240]   they're getting their degrees and they're getting married,
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:22.120]   they're stepping out of the career world,
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:23.680]   and they're raising babies.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:27.420]   But women who are hardcore on career track,
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:29.760]   it's very difficult for them to have babies.
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:31.040]   So could we change it?
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:32.580]   Could we get more education accomplished
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:33.920]   in the teenage years?
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:35.840]   A good friend of mine was homeschooled.
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:39.840]   She went to college at 16, and she was a practicing doctor,
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:42.480]   probably when she was, I think, 23, 24.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:46.680]   And she herself married a doctor and had children.
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:51.160]   And so I think adolescents and teens are capable
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:53.640]   of a much more accelerated educational program
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.480]   than we currently do.
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:58.320]   Another question, couldn't we make careers fit
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:42:59.560]   around motherhood?
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:02.560]   So the pressure that women feel
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:06.040]   to make as much money as possible
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:11.040]   is often due to the old system of men starting a career,
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:15.800]   raising their family, working, and then retiring at 65.
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:18.600]   So women feel like they got to do all of that
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.480]   on the same time schedule as everyone else.
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:24.200]   They got to compete with men constantly
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:27.160]   and be earning the same amount or more than men.
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:29.960]   And they got to do it all in the same timeline.
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:32.140]   But why do we have to do it on that timeline?
[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:35.700]   Why can't we create social structures
[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:39.600]   that allow a woman to have children
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:44.000]   while she's in school, getting educated, doing things?
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.620]   Why can't we create a time gap
[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:48.680]   where she spends 10 years raising small children?
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:50.840]   And then after her children are older
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:52.200]   and they can be enrolled in school,
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:54.960]   then she goes and starts her career
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:56.840]   or continues her career.
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:59.280]   I think that many of the expectations that we have
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:03.520]   around how to handle school marriage children are false.
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:06.420]   I don't see why it would be a bad thing
[02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:08.380]   to have babies in college.
[02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:10.660]   There clearly needs to be some financial support.
[02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:14.460]   So if I were an 18-year-old and I had an 18-year-old wife
[02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:15.820]   and I were thinking about having a baby,
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:18.260]   my question is just how am I gonna do it?
[02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:20.680]   How am I gonna provide for a wife and a baby?
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:24.220]   But if I have a job and my wife is in school,
[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:27.900]   I don't see why she can't have a baby and go to school.
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:30.200]   It's actually probably a really great time to have a baby
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:32.900]   because she's young, she's energetic,
[02:44:32.900 --> 02:44:37.900]   she can deal with lack of sleep or loss of sleep
[02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:39.700]   or disrupted sleep schedule much more easily
[02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:41.480]   than she can when she's 35.
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:42.740]   There's lots of other people around.
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:43.700]   There's lots of babysitters.
[02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:44.900]   There may be people in our dorm.
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:46.700]   There's lots of people who can come and take care of the baby
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:48.260]   while she goes to class.
[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:49.300]   There's all kinds of ways.
[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:51.340]   So college and babies,
[02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:53.660]   I don't think are necessarily opposed to each other.
[02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:54.780]   Why should they be?
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:55.980]   They don't have to be.
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:44:58.300]   And so we just need to think through all these assumptions
[02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:00.900]   that we've embraced that have created
[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:02.800]   a falling apart society.
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:06.860]   So couldn't we make careers fit around motherhood?
[02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:10.140]   Couldn't a mother start earlier in some cases,
[02:45:10.140 --> 02:45:12.580]   but then start later and continue later?
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:15.500]   Couldn't she, if she wants to have children
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:16.780]   and she wants to earn income,
[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:18.860]   couldn't we accept both of those things
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:21.100]   by just adjusting expectations?
[02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:23.180]   All of these things are just social expectations
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:25.300]   and thus they can be reprogrammed.
[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:26.820]   In addition, you asked the question,
[02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:29.300]   could we subsidize motherhood financially?
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:31.500]   Now, many countries are doing this.
[02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:35.100]   It is not demonstrating itself to have a positive impact
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:36.700]   on total fertility rates.
[02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:38.820]   But in many countries,
[02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:41.500]   the ones I have the best data on are the European countries.
[02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:43.860]   You have the German Kindergarten system
[02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:46.820]   where parents are just paid for having children.
[02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:48.540]   And that's something that can be done.
[02:45:48.540 --> 02:45:50.480]   I think will be done more in the future,
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:53.340]   but it's not actually changing things right now
[02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:57.300]   in terms of birth rates.
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:45:59.260]   Nevertheless, I expect that to be a path
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:00.260]   that we continue down,
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:01.940]   that I think we're gonna continue to say,
[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:03.460]   can we pay people to have babies?
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:05.180]   Can we subsidize them?
[02:46:05.180 --> 02:46:07.180]   And so here, I think it's very reasonable
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:08.540]   that that could happen.
[02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:12.500]   And if you put this together with health benefits
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:13.980]   and other forms of subsidies,
[02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:19.860]   then I think that young people could make this work.
[02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:21.060]   Let me give an example.
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:23.420]   Let's say that I've got one of my sons
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:28.420]   and one of my sons finds an amazing wife.
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:32.340]   And let's say that they meet at 18 years old
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:33.800]   and they go to, and they're living,
[02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:34.840]   they could do this in the United States,
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:37.780]   but I'm just gonna use a welfare state country
[02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:38.980]   as an example.
[02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:42.480]   So they move to Berlin and they're going to college
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:46.140]   in Germany that's tuition-free, living in Berlin.
[02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:51.020]   And they of course have to pay for housing, room and board.
[02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:52.740]   But when you're young, you can do that
[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:54.580]   and you can fit two small people into a room.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:56.380]   It's not that big of a deal.
[02:46:56.380 --> 02:47:00.180]   And if you have a baby, great, you have a baby.
[02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:02.800]   Well, in Berlin, they would start receiving kindergarten.
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:04.220]   And not only then, of course,
[02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:07.180]   would the government pay for medical costs,
[02:47:07.180 --> 02:47:08.740]   but you get kindergarten for the child.
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:11.780]   You get a monthly payment amount for the child.
[02:47:11.780 --> 02:47:14.980]   You have a very low income 'cause they're both in college.
[02:47:14.980 --> 02:47:15.980]   The college is paid for.
[02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:18.740]   All that my son would have to do as a husband
[02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:23.740]   would be to provide enough money to pay for room and board.
[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:26.360]   And if I, as a parent, am involved in that,
[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:29.500]   then I can support him and them in that as well.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:30.340]   Because as a parent,
[02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:32.060]   I should be willing to support my children
[02:47:32.060 --> 02:47:34.380]   if they're having grandchildren to some degree.
[02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:35.300]   If I'm not willing to do it,
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:37.180]   why should I expect society to do that?
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:39.860]   Now we could do something similar in the United States.
[02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:43.220]   In the United States, tuitions are very broad,
[02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:46.540]   but it doesn't cost that much for college students to live.
[02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:50.420]   It doesn't cost that much for them to feed themselves.
[02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:52.260]   There are already today in the United States,
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:53.780]   there's plenty of welfare programs,
[02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:56.440]   Medicaid that can pay for the birth of the baby.
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:59.800]   And there's not a version of Kindergarten
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:00.760]   in the United States today,
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:02.700]   but there may be something like that in the future
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:04.280]   if we continue down the path that we're in
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:05.640]   in a welfare state.
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:09.320]   So my point is that if young people desire to have children,
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:13.660]   they can be done during college years
[02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:16.120]   when young men and women are most fertile,
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:17.240]   when they're able to handle that.
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:20.400]   And I don't see that as something
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:22.520]   that should just be avoided at all costs.
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:26.260]   I think there's something that should come into play there.
[02:48:26.260 --> 02:48:30.100]   And we probably will be subsidizing motherhood
[02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:33.040]   in virtually all of our societies in the future.
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:35.180]   Again, most welfare states are already doing that.
[02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:36.900]   We're not doing that in the United States.
[02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:37.980]   We will be in the future.
[02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:40.020]   Right now, the United States has been relying
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:41.620]   almost entirely on immigrants
[02:48:41.620 --> 02:48:44.200]   to make up for the population shortfall,
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:46.580]   but the world is basically running out of immigrants.
[02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:48.860]   So the only potential source of immigrants
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:51.020]   for the United States would be Sub-Saharan Africa.
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:54.360]   All of the Americas are now basically empty of immigrants
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:56.040]   and there aren't enough people there.
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:49:00.080]   They're facing their own population issues.
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:02.560]   So we're gonna be fighting with the rest of the world
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:04.600]   for all of the African immigrants,
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:06.440]   but Europe has already been importing
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:10.160]   more of those immigrants than the United States.
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:12.040]   So next, I would just say,
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:14.440]   can we adjust career expectations
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:17.140]   and make family enterprises more common?
[02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:19.000]   So I would love to see more of this.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.460]   Can we bring together men and women in family enterprises?
[02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:24.140]   If you look at most of the problems
[02:49:24.140 --> 02:49:29.140]   that husbands and wives face with their career obligations,
[02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:32.640]   the worst possible living arrangement
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:34.400]   is for both of them to have jobs.
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:39.200]   If either the husband or the wife doesn't have a job,
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:40.780]   but instead has a business,
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:43.260]   which gives him or her a modicum of self-control
[02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:45.140]   over his schedule and his life,
[02:49:45.140 --> 02:49:48.800]   then you have dramatically better outcomes from that.
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:52.180]   So could we give men and women a balance?
[02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:54.060]   Now, what's even better is bring both of them together
[02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:55.580]   in a family enterprise.
[02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:58.580]   And so if our sons and our daughters
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:02.060]   could channel their career ambitions
[02:50:02.060 --> 02:50:06.220]   into something that's a good fit for a family enterprise,
[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:09.660]   then we can satisfy that desire to build a career
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:12.780]   without it compromising the family.
[02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:16.260]   And I think that there's a lot more of this that is needed.
[02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:19.480]   I didn't marry my wife because she, you know,
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:21.120]   could make me a lot of money,
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:24.740]   but my wife is an important part of my life and in my world.
[02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:28.000]   And what I've always admired is husbands and wives
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:29.840]   who work together in a business
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.400]   and they bring complimentary skills.
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:33.320]   I think that brings a whole set of challenges
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:34.600]   that have to be worked to,
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:36.120]   but that's an enormous opportunity
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.600]   for solving some of these,
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:40.240]   the tension between the family and the business.
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:41.560]   And I also see that as appropriate
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:42.680]   for all these other benefits
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:45.120]   of passing down through the generations as well.
[02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:51.060]   We've talked then about attracting a spouse,
[02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:57.300]   selecting a spouse now, and marrying a spouse.
[02:50:57.300 --> 02:51:00.220]   So now what about having children?
[02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:01.980]   What do people need to have children?
[02:51:01.980 --> 02:51:04.300]   General young people to be confident in having children,
[02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:05.660]   they need to be debt-free,
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:07.100]   they need to have a sufficient income
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:09.140]   and they only need to own a big enough home.
[02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:12.000]   And so as parents, we can affect these things.
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.980]   We can teach our children to stay out of debt.
[02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:19.580]   People being indebted is entirely a choice.
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:21.740]   It's a lifestyle choice that people make.
[02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:24.300]   And we can teach our children to stay out of debt,
[02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:26.020]   knowing that that will help them
[02:51:26.020 --> 02:51:30.520]   to be able to afford to have children in the future.
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:34.620]   You say, "Well, Joshua, what about educational debt?"
[02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:37.620]   You can teach your children to stay out of educational debt.
[02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:40.860]   I wrestled with years with some of the hardcore scenarios
[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:42.140]   of law school, medical school,
[02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:43.980]   I finally cracked the nut on those.
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:45.740]   Not perfectly, and I'm not saying
[02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:47.980]   that all people should avoid medical school,
[02:51:47.980 --> 02:51:51.900]   but debt is entirely avoidable.
[02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:55.700]   So let's do that because it matters for reproduction.
[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:58.820]   In addition to just teaching them to stay out of debt,
[02:51:58.820 --> 02:51:59.780]   we can pay for it.
[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:01.740]   If you want to have grandchildren,
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:04.440]   you probably need to pay for your children's college.
[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:07.840]   It's up to you.
[02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:08.820]   If you wanna have grandchildren,
[02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:10.980]   you probably need to pay for your children's college.
[02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:12.540]   If you wanna have grandchildren soon,
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:13.500]   and many grandchildren,
[02:52:13.500 --> 02:52:15.900]   you probably need to pay for your children's college.
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:18.700]   Next, as parents, we can subsidize
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:22.740]   our children's first house, or at least a down payment.
[02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:25.540]   If we don't have money, we can subsidize with education,
[02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:27.340]   as I described from Steve Maxwell's story
[02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:30.900]   of his son saving enough money to pay for their houses.
[02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:33.220]   We can also subsidize it with money.
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:35.900]   If you want great, so if you want your children
[02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:38.940]   to be successful with money,
[02:52:38.940 --> 02:52:41.780]   give them money when it really counts.
[02:52:41.780 --> 02:52:44.080]   And giving your children a down payment for a house,
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:46.700]   or giving your children a house,
[02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:50.060]   I think is an amazing goal for you to have.
[02:52:50.060 --> 02:52:54.880]   If you show up in my office,
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:58.320]   and you have a thin retirement portfolio,
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:53:01.460]   but you have three children,
[02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:04.100]   and all of your children are living in debt-free houses,
[02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:06.300]   and they've all got three children,
[02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:08.700]   I would bet you're gonna be more satisfied
[02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:10.820]   with your life and with your decisions
[02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:12.100]   than if you showed up in my office
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:15.940]   with a big, fat retirement portfolio and no grandchildren.
[02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:20.660]   Houses don't cost that much
[02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:23.020]   for most listeners of Radical Personal Finance.
[02:53:23.020 --> 02:53:26.880]   What happens is that we've never set goals around them.
[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:28.540]   We've set goals exclusively around
[02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:30.460]   accumulating lots of money for retirement,
[02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:34.220]   not based upon housing for our grandchildren.
[02:53:34.220 --> 02:53:38.640]   So consider, save for a down payment for your child's house.
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:41.740]   Save for a house for your children.
[02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:44.860]   If you can't do that,
[02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:47.100]   and if you wanna have grandchildren,
[02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:49.940]   give your children the big, fancy house that you live in,
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:52.680]   and you move into a small studio apartment.
[02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:56.100]   I'm not joking about this.
[02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:58.420]   To me, it's the most obvious thing in the world
[02:53:58.420 --> 02:54:01.780]   that would be a win-win for multiple people.
[02:54:01.780 --> 02:54:05.500]   There's so many wealthy men and women in their 50s
[02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:08.100]   who are living in fancy houses,
[02:54:08.100 --> 02:54:09.860]   and they're bugging their children,
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:10.700]   "Why don't you gonna have children?
[02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:11.700]   "Why don't you have children?"
[02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:13.060]   And the children are saying, "Mom, Dad,
[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:14.780]   "we can't even afford to live."
[02:54:14.780 --> 02:54:16.660]   And both of them are right.
[02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:18.260]   So if you really care about it,
[02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:20.420]   give your children your house,
[02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:22.400]   and you go and move into a small apartment.
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.140]   Both of you will probably be happier about it.
[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:25.640]   You don't need a big, giant house
[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:28.060]   when you're 50X years old or 60 years old.
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:29.380]   You need a studio, an empty nester,
[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:30.700]   you need a studio apartment.
[02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:32.940]   You'll probably be happier in your studio apartment
[02:54:32.940 --> 02:54:34.780]   going out every night, eating out every night,
[02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:37.340]   enjoying kind of a totally different lifestyle,
[02:54:37.340 --> 02:54:39.020]   and your children will do better being in a house,
[02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:40.740]   and you'll probably have some grandchildren.
[02:54:40.740 --> 02:54:43.980]   So be open to anything.
[02:54:43.980 --> 02:54:46.820]   We have to change things, or our families are gonna die,
[02:54:46.820 --> 02:54:48.900]   and our culture is gonna die.
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:51.760]   We can support child raising within our community.
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:55.620]   So the cost of childcare is the third big expense.
[02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:58.140]   The things that people say that young people
[02:54:58.140 --> 02:54:59.860]   who could be having babies,
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:01.580]   who are choosing not to have babies say.
[02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:03.900]   Number one, debt, student loan debt.
[02:55:03.900 --> 02:55:04.960]   Number two, housing.
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:06.540]   Number three, childcare.
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:08.780]   Well, if you can't give your children a house,
[02:55:08.780 --> 02:55:12.020]   or maybe you can't, support your children with childcare.
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:15.460]   Retired parents can be primary caregivers for grandchildren,
[02:55:15.460 --> 02:55:18.820]   and this can be a really great way to provide the care
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:21.020]   that allows moms and dads to go to work,
[02:55:21.020 --> 02:55:23.420]   and yet provides really high-quality care.
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:25.140]   And you've done it once, you can do it again.
[02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:26.900]   And so if you want grandchildren,
[02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:31.180]   be willing to do what is necessary to help encourage that.
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:34.060]   In addition, we can subsidize many of the luxuries of life
[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:35.780]   to support our children.
[02:55:35.780 --> 02:55:40.780]   So if young parents know that when you have children,
[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:44.940]   you know that there's a pretty decent chance
[02:55:44.940 --> 02:55:45.780]   that you're giving up
[02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:47.640]   on some of the luxury consumption items
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:50.640]   that your friends are gonna be able to go and do.
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:53.360]   There's a reason why there's nonstop,
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:57.600]   nonstop, you know, we're not nonstop,
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:01.480]   but there's a reason why there's all the TikTok memes of,
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:03.160]   you know, we're dual income, we're dual income.
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:04.640]   We can go anywhere we want this weekend.
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:07.360]   As a parent, you know, I'm probably giving that up.
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:11.060]   So go ahead, if you are a wealthy parent,
[02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:13.680]   go ahead and subsidize some of the luxuries.
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.260]   And you can do that in various ways.
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:16.720]   You can do it structurally.
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:18.760]   You can provide your children with income.
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:20.560]   You can do it with a trust.
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:22.000]   You can provide your children with housing.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:23.600]   You can give your children a boat.
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:25.720]   You can do things on an ad hoc basis
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:27.600]   or on a continual basis.
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.000]   But if you have money, be willing to spend it
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.320]   to help your children to have children.
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:36.000]   Now, if you just throw money at your children
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.240]   and you haven't built all those cultural foundations
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:39.720]   that I started the show with,
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:41.200]   I don't think you're gonna have grandchildren.
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:42.040]   I don't think you're gonna have
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:43.680]   a hundred great-grandchildren.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:46.840]   But if you focus on doing both of them,
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:48.800]   then I think the chances are pretty good
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:50.400]   that you'll be able to do both.
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:54.840]   My wife and I have grown our family
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:57.520]   based upon what I have earned.
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:00.160]   Nobody's given us really anything.
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:02.980]   And that's fine, and that's good.
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:05.320]   We have five children,
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:07.440]   so they didn't need to give us anything.
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:08.800]   Probably would have been easier, though,
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:11.200]   if people wanted grandchildren
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:12.600]   and they wanted their things to grow on,
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:15.800]   it would have been easier to have a stipend.
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:17.520]   So look for ways you can do it.
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:19.320]   You can pay for your grandchildren's school,
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:21.320]   or you can tell your children they would be.
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:23.840]   My children are not in private school.
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:27.240]   That's something that grandchildren can subsidize.
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:28.560]   You can pay for schooling.
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:30.800]   You can pay for activities.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:33.680]   You can pay for extra expenses.
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:35.960]   There's all kinds of things that you can do
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:37.440]   for your children to help them
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:39.520]   and encourage them to have grandchildren.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:42.460]   And so think ahead and plan for those things.
[02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:44.600]   In addition, I think it's reasonable
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:45.720]   to think about estate planning.
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.760]   And I think that if you want to have grandchildren,
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:51.800]   then you should consider splitting your estate
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:54.640]   not based upon the number of children that you have,
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:57.960]   but based upon the number of grandchildren that you have.
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:00.040]   I'm not necessarily encouraging this,
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:03.360]   as I think that it should be part of the family dynamic
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:06.200]   as to what your goals and values are.
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:10.720]   What I'm trying to say is that if we were to set a goal
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:14.780]   of something like you're having 100 great-grandchildren,
[02:58:14.780 --> 02:58:17.720]   then we should be open to all the strategies
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:22.440]   that could potentially help in the accomplishment
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:24.200]   and the achievement of that goal.
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:27.000]   And one thing that you can do if you have money
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.480]   is you can tell your children
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:30.560]   that I'll spend money on the things that I value,
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.240]   and one of the things that I value is grandchildren.
[02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:34.760]   So if you have four children
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:36.880]   and two of your children have four children
[02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:38.840]   and two of your children don't have children,
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:41.640]   why don't you reflect that in not only the money
[02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:42.960]   that you spend now while you're alive,
[02:58:42.960 --> 02:58:45.240]   but to reflect that in your estate?
[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:49.560]   When children, in the same way that in order for a woman
[02:58:49.560 --> 02:58:52.320]   to be a full-time mom and walk away
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:54.040]   from a highly paid career,
[02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:56.200]   she needs to really believe that it's worth it,
[02:58:56.200 --> 02:58:58.640]   and that's a hard thing for many women to do,
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:00.080]   similarly for children.
[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:04.320]   If you know that I'm investing into having children,
[02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:07.960]   I know that I'm taking a financial cost for this
[02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:10.240]   because I'm giving up potential income
[02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:11.920]   to be a present father.
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:14.220]   I'm giving up flexibility,
[02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:17.800]   and I'm also adding expenses to my life.
[02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:22.520]   If I know that my wealthy father or my wealthy mother
[02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:25.960]   is writing me in for a significant portion
[02:59:25.960 --> 02:59:27.480]   of his or her estate,
[02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:31.080]   that's gonna help me be more willing to make that choice.
[02:59:31.080 --> 02:59:33.480]   And while that's probably not gonna affect
[02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:35.280]   the global fertility rate,
[02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:38.080]   it's probably gonna reflect the total fertility rate
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:39.260]   within your family.
[02:59:41.160 --> 02:59:42.640]   I've said quite a lot.
[02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:44.240]   I hope that it is useful to you.
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:47.880]   I didn't really expect this show to be three hours,
[02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:48.780]   but here we are.
[02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:53.580]   My hope in today's show is not to give you all the answers,
[02:59:53.580 --> 02:59:55.340]   but to inspire a conversation.
[02:59:55.340 --> 03:00:00.480]   As a society, we are dying.
[03:00:00.480 --> 03:00:04.120]   Slowly and inexorably.
[03:00:04.120 --> 03:00:05.960]   We're not dying as quickly in the United States
[03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:08.660]   as we are in Japan and in South Korea and in China,
[03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:10.600]   but we are dying.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:15.680]   And the first obligation that we have to our fellow humanity,
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:18.600]   to our species, is to not die.
[03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:22.400]   Human beings probably don't deserve
[03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:24.560]   to be on the endangered list yet,
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:27.400]   but there are warning signs everywhere.
[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:29.880]   So if you care about that,
[03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:32.580]   if you care about the continuance of your family,
[03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:35.680]   then pay attention and let's talk about these things.
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:37.560]   What I'm hoping to do in today's podcast
[03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:39.520]   is just to give you enough thoughts
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:41.580]   to inspire a conversation.
[03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:44.840]   I want to inspire you to talk with your wife,
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:47.760]   talk with your husband, and to start there.
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.560]   As I've previously said, maybe have one more baby.
[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:51.480]   I think it's worth it.
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:55.000]   I think you won't regret it, but consider it.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.140]   If it costs you a little bit of money,
[03:00:56.140 --> 03:00:58.240]   I think that's a reasonable decision.
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:00.320]   Broadly speaking, I wanna inspire conversations
[03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:02.260]   with you with fellow parents.
[03:01:02.260 --> 03:01:06.680]   Again, I don't see any reason why having the largest number
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:08.720]   at the end of our life in a net worth statement
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:10.320]   is a compelling goal.
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:12.420]   It's not, I think it's a dumb goal.
[03:01:12.420 --> 03:01:14.520]   I think we should optimize for other things.
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:16.520]   And there's a whole range of optimization
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:19.320]   that you can optimize for for yourself.
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:21.920]   But I also think it's reasonable
[03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:25.380]   that if we look at all of recorded history,
[03:01:25.380 --> 03:01:27.200]   all of recorded humanity,
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:29.340]   all of our ancestors who've come before us,
[03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:33.320]   that the ambition that a man or woman had
[03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:37.200]   to be the patriarch or matriarch of a dynasty,
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:40.340]   that that was a core component of life for many people.
[03:01:40.340 --> 03:01:43.320]   And I don't see why it should change today.
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:45.700]   And somehow, though we live
[03:01:45.700 --> 03:01:48.580]   in the easiest time in human history,
[03:01:48.580 --> 03:01:53.540]   with the most abundant wealth of all time in human history,
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:55.980]   we've optimized almost exclusively
[03:01:55.980 --> 03:01:59.140]   for higher financial wealth,
[03:01:59.140 --> 03:02:01.320]   and we're not even replacing ourselves.
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:05.160]   Whereas the societies that replace themselves
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:07.440]   are often the ones that are desperately poor,
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:10.200]   can barely feed themselves,
[03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:14.360]   desperate violence, children dying all over the place,
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:16.920]   and you and I sit back, fat, happy, and rich,
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:19.480]   and we don't even bother to continue.
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:23.320]   So I'd like to just inspire people to add some other goals.
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:25.880]   I think the ambition to say,
[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:27.680]   "How could I build a family culture
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:30.560]   "that resulted in my having 100 great-grandchildren?"
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:32.280]   is a pretty cool idea.
[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:34.680]   I didn't say 1,000, obviously not.
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:36.000]   Maybe it's 50.
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.160]   You do the math, you pick your number.
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:41.640]   But if you had four or five children,
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:43.760]   and each of your children had four or five children,
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:45.920]   then things grow pretty quickly.
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:47.640]   And that's not too crazy.
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:50.440]   That's not too far out of the envelope
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:53.560]   for where you could possibly be.
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:54.840]   And I think that if you spent money
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:56.840]   on building that kind of family culture,
[03:02:56.840 --> 03:02:58.160]   spent time on it,
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:00.160]   I think that you reflect back at the end of your life
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:02.040]   with a high degree of satisfaction
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:03.800]   on your contribution to your family,
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:06.440]   on your contribution to the human species,
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:08.440]   and on your contribution to the world.
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:09.280]   Thank you for listening.
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:11.240]   I hope that I've inspired some conversations.
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:13.120]   Share with me your ideas in the days to come.
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:15.280]   I really wanna hear from you in the days to come.
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:19.240]   - The drive to go further and reach higher.
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:22.160]   The same thing that inspires you inspires us.
