[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of the Second Psalm,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.920]   one of the two readings at the beginning of the service. The Second Psalm, which begins
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:30.400]   with these words, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?" Now,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.520]   I can well believe that there are many in this congregation at this moment who are wondering
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.040]   to themselves as to what this old psalm, which was probably written very nearly 3,000 years
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:01:00.280]   ago, has to do with us living in 1979. The vast majority of the people of this country,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.960]   as we are all aware, certainly would take that view. They no longer attend places of
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.960]   worship because they feel that it is utterly pointless to do so, that in our modern world,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.080]   with its teeming problems, its increasing crises, and its dim and dismal outlook, they
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.200]   feel that this old book has obviously got nothing to say to us and cannot possibly be
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.160]   of any help or of aid to us. Well, now, I want to deal with that position, and I want
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   to not only justify our gathering together in a building such as this on a Wednesday
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.760]   evening, but I want to show you that not only is the message of this book, which we call
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:05.680]   the Bible, relevant to the modern men and to the modern problem, but I want to go further,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.960]   and I want to show that nothing else is relevant, that this is the only book which throws any
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.080]   light upon our problems and our predicament, and the only book that holds out any hope
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.920]   for any one of us in this modern world.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.360]   Now this psalm is a very remarkable one. As I say, it was written very nearly 3,000 years
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   ago by David, the king of Israel. He was writing primarily for his own age and his own generation,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.480]   and he was concerned about the situation and about the whole condition of mankind in his
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.800]   time. And he describes it and he deals with it. But not only was he doing that, because
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:14.840]   he was a man of God, he was doing something further. He was describing the whole state
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.960]   and condition of the human race, ever since that early point in its long story, when it
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.320]   turned its back upon God and began to experience its terrifying problems.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.840]   This psalm not only describes what conditions were like in the time of David, it's an equally
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.880]   valid and good description of what times had been like on many a previous occasion, and
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.920]   what they were like on many a subsequent occasion. I asked our friend to read that section out
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.320]   of the fourth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, because you noticed that
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:08.840]   there this psalm was quoted. That passage was dealing with the early Christian church.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.880]   She'd only just come into being, but she was being persecuted. Two of the leaders, the
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.080]   apostles, Peter and John, had been arrested. They'd been arraigned before a court, they'd
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.560]   been condemned, and they'd been threatened that if they persisted in preaching about
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.640]   this Jesus of Nazareth and his message, that they would be put to death. And then they
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.240]   were let loose and they went back to their own company, the members of the church, and
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.560]   reported what had happened to them. And we are told that the moment the church heard
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.040]   that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and they began to pray. And they
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.440]   hadn't been praying for long before they began quoting this second psalm. And what
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.840]   they said was this. What David said, what was said through the voice of thy servant
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.240]   David, is equally true today, they said. The heathen are raging, the people are imagining
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.320]   a vain thing, the kings of the earth are setting themselves and the rulers take counsel together.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   They said it's against you and against your Christ that they're doing the same thing
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   now. David was not only describing what was happening in his day, he was giving a valid
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.880]   and an accurate description of what was happening when the Lord Jesus Christ was in this world
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.720]   â€“ the conditions in the first century. And indeed, this is a description, I say, of the
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.480]   state of mankind in many another age. And I want to show you that it is a particularly
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.920]   accurate description of the state of affairs obtaining in this country and in the world
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.960]   at large at this present time. Now that's the remarkable thing about this book which
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.040]   is called the Bible. It's not only God's book, it's a book of history. It's a book
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:20.080]   which gives us the story of the human race, explains why it is as it is, and as I say,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:29.140]   holds out the only hope of an adequate and a real solution. Very well, let's consider
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:38.360]   what it says. You notice that the psalmist starts with what is in most of our Bibles
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:48.040]   put as a question. Why do the heathen rage? Why do the people imagine a vain thing? Well,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.320]   it is a question, but I think that it's more than a question. The psalmist is expressing
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:07.840]   his horror, his astonishment, his amazement. He says, "Why are things as they are?"
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:15.560]   And surely this is the question that every thinking person must be asking tonight. Here
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:23.640]   we are in this last quarter of the twentieth century and our world is in terrible trouble.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.880]   We are all aware of this. We've had two world wars already in this century. They're
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.760]   building and piling up these horrible armaments. Is there going to be another world war? What's
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:43.040]   it all going to lead to? We are aware of the industrial strife, moral strife, breakdown
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.480]   of law and order. Now, we're all aware. If we read a newspaper, if you listen to the
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.440]   news bulletins, you cannot but be aware of the fact that the world is in terrible trouble
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:01.280]   and there are mounting problems. And we therefore stand back and we ask, "What's the matter?"
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.760]   That's exactly what David said. That's what those people were saying when they were
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.720]   praying in the early church. Well, now then, he not only asks the question, he goes further.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:21.680]   He starts by giving us a description of the conditions prevailing then. And I'm here
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.240]   to show you that it is the most perfect and most accurate description of the state of
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:35.320]   society tonight. What was the condition? Well, here it is. Why do the heathen rage? That's
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:43.000]   the term. Why do they rage? Now, this term, if you like, can be translated as, "Why
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.720]   do they make a tumult?" He says, "What's the matter with people?" Society, he says,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:59.600]   is like a raging or a roaring sea. That's how affairs were then. Now, this is a very
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:11.240]   interesting thing in the history of the human race. Mankind is always restless. That's
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:20.040]   why the Bible, in one of its favorite analogies, compares the human race to the sea. And as
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.760]   you know, the great characteristic of the sea is that it is always restless. It's
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.480]   always moving. Now, I know that on a very fine summer's day, you look at the sea and
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.920]   you're almost persuaded that it's not moving at all. We say it is as calm as a mill pond.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:48.440]   You can't see any movement, but there is movement there. The sea is never quiet. It's
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:55.240]   always on the move, ebb and flow, backwards and forwards, almost imperceptible at times.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.760]   But nevertheless, there is always this characteristic of movement and of restlessness.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:12.200]   Well, now, according to the Bible, that is always true of the human race at all times.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.480]   And there are times that have been epochs in the history of mankind when there has been
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:24.840]   such peace and quiet that some people thought we really had arrived at utopia. You read
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:32.000]   in your secular history books about the Pax Romana. There was a long period of quiet and
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   of rest, and everything seemed to be perfect. And last century was referred to and is still
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.800]   referred to as the Pax Britannica. I know there was an incident like the Crimean War,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.400]   but roughly speaking, there had been no major war after the Napoleonic Wars. And this country
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.320]   in her might and her power was able to preserve a kind of peace. And the result was that some
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.080]   people really believed we'd arrived in nirvana. And Tennyson and others sang about the Parliament
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.720]   of Men and the Federation of the World. The human race seemed to have grown up, and we
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.160]   were going to solve all our problems. There'd be no more wars, no more troubles, no more
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:20.760]   crises. It was to be perfect peace and rest and calm. There have been such times. But
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   even then, there was always the restlessness. There were troubles and problems a hundred
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.840]   years ago. There was vice, there was crime, there was...you still had a need of a police
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:42.880]   force. Though apparently so quiet, like the sea in summer, there was always the restlessness.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:51.240]   And you can't find rest. Man's always looking for rest. But as Augustine said so many centuries
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.080]   ago at the beginning of the fifth century, "Thou hast made us for thyself, and our hearts
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:06.200]   are restless until they find their rest in thee." Now, that is always permanently the
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.000]   condition of mankind. But, and this is the point that is made in this song, and this
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.240]   is the truth about tonight. While there are periods when life seems calm, there are other
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:30.040]   periods when it's like the raging of the sea. And that's how it was in the time of David.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.960]   That's how it was at the time before the flood. That's how it was just before these children
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:43.400]   of Israel were carried to the captivity in Babylon. That's how it was in the first century.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.240]   That's how it was after the restoration of Charles II in 1660. That's how it was in the
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:59.600]   Regency period, at the end of the reign of George III. And that's how it is tonight.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:07.760]   We are looking tonight not at a calm, quiet, apparently immobile sea. We are looking at
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:17.440]   a storm. We are looking at a raging sea, a violent sea. We are looking at billows rising
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.200]   up and hurling themselves. We are looking up at a violent churning in the depths of
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:31.520]   the oceans. Well, the prophet Isaiah, he summed it up in a memorable phrase. He said, "The
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:39.800]   wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.760]   I've said that there were sin and there were moral problems a hundred years ago, but it
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:53.180]   wasn't like tonight. That was a comparatively halcyon period. What are we confronted by?
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:14:01.400]   We are not only confronted by sin. We are confronted by violent sin, by open sin, by
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:08.080]   burstful sin. We are in an age in which men not only sin, but they're proud of it. And
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.920]   if you don't sin, you're regarded as a back number, as a square. We are not living in
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   an age of people just drinking and getting drunk occasionally. We are in the age of alcoholism,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.200]   of violent drunkenness. We are in an age of violence on the streets so that it's no longer
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:35.400]   safe to walk home at night. We're in an age of drug addiction. We're in an age of robbery
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.520]   with violence, thuggery. Why need to waste your time? You're all aware of this. In other
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.160]   words, you see, we are back again in one of these epochs described here by David in his
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:57.280]   book. We are witnessing raging sin. The sanctities are being spat upon. Married life, home life
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:03.080]   breaking down. Morality is vanished. Every man does that which is right in his own eyes
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.720]   and violence is facing us everywhere. Haven't you noticed the loudness of the so-called
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:16.680]   music and the shouting and the raving? Well, isn't this a perfect description of our world
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:24.960]   tonight? Why do the heathen rage? What's the matter with the world? Isn't it about time
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.240]   we face this question? Well, now that's the very question that the psalmist is asking
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:38.440]   us to face. He says here, "Be wise now therefore. Be instructed," he says. This is the whole
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.400]   object of the message of the Bible, to make us think. You know, the people outside, the
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.640]   people who never go to a place of worship, they think that those of us who are Christians,
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.000]   they think we're just a pack of unintelligent people, that we never read and we never think.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.040]   They imagine that we just meet together in our buildings, pull down the blinds of the
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.320]   problems of life and just sing our hymns and our choruses and work ourselves up into some
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.960]   sort of emotional riot and are not aware of what is happening in the world outside. I'm
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.060]   here to remind you that the exact opposite is the truth. It is we alone who are facing
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:19.400]   the facts. The newspapers and the rest are trying to cover them. I'm here to expose them.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:30.200]   The world is raving tonight. It is raging. It is violent. And this turbulent sea is casting
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:38.840]   up mire and dirt. Oh, the filth of today. The filth on the television and the wireless,
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:45.440]   the filth in the newspapers, the filth on the hoardings, mire and dirt. Well, that's
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.840]   part of the description. But it isn't the whole of the description. He says, "Why do
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:58.080]   the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?" Probably he was differentiating
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.960]   between pagans and Jews. Doesn't matter. Taking as a whole, it's a description of the world
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:14.080]   as it then was. The raging and the people imagining a vain thing. Now, what does that
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.640]   mean? Well, somebody's translated it like this, and I think it's a better translation.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:26.760]   Instead of saying, "The people imagine a vain thing," he says, "Why are the people devising
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:37.120]   futile and empty schemes?" That's what it means. Imagining a vain thing. Or, "Devising
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:46.240]   futile and empty schemes." Isn't this Bible a wonderful book? Do you know of a more perfect
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.880]   description of this world tonight than this? On the one hand, you see, you have this raging
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:01.240]   violence of sin. At the same time, exactly, the leaders of society, the politicians, the
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:07.000]   educationalists, the philosophers, and all the others, what are they doing? They are
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.640]   devising futile and empty schemes. They've been doing it the last three weeks in the
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.480]   animal congresses and conferences of the political parties. What have they been doing? They've
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:26.120]   been putting forward schemes to cure the problems of society. They're aware of the problems,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.040]   and there they've spent their days in putting forward schemes. Each party has got its scheme,
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.960]   and it differs from the other parties. But the Bible says they're all together futile
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:44.220]   and empty, and they lead to nothing. But this is the perfect description of our world tonight.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.320]   On the one hand, the violence, sinning, and the noise, and the clutter, and the confusion,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.480]   and the breakdown of everything that's sacred, and in the meantime, mankind in its confidence
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.480]   putting forward its schemes and its proposals and its ideas, and is confident that it can
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:10.840]   deal with it. But the verdict of the Bible upon it all is that it is empty and futile
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:18.360]   and will lead to nothing. And I want to establish this fact. It's about time we face the facts,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.680]   my friends. People don't go to churches any longer and listen to the Bible and preaching
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.960]   because they think it's got nothing to say. They are turning to these other things. Here
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:33.300]   are these pundits giving their pompous opinions on the television and the wireless, writing
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:38.440]   their articles to the Sunday newspapers. But it's about time we ask the question, what
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.320]   are their schemes? What are their ideas? What are they leading to? Let me ask a still wider
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:52.840]   question. What has civilization led to? What has the world in its wisdom produced by tonight?
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.700]   And I suggest to you that this is the only answer. All the schemes have proved to be
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.960]   empty and futile, complete failures. Now, you needn't take my word for this. I can
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.840]   demonstrate it to you. You remember, some of you, the First World War. I remember it
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.920]   well. You see, before that war, our leaders were very confident that we'd never have another
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:25.120]   war. They said war is due to ignorance, but now we are educated. War, they said, is due
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.200]   to the fact that people don't travel and they don't know one another, so they fight. But
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.440]   now they say we are able to travel. We've got the steam engine and we can travel and
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.920]   we can mix and we're going to banish war. And they really believed that. As I've already
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.960]   quoted Tennyson to you, he talked about the Parliament of Men, the Federation of the World.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.000]   We were entering this century when men were going to turn their swords into plowshares.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.600]   But suddenly a world war broke out and they were shaken. But it's all right, they said.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   This is the war to end war. And then they concocted the scheme of the League of Nations.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:12.480]   This was going to banish war. It was going to outlaw war, make war impossible. And you
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.440]   know, I remember the time very well. They really believed it. And unfortunately, many
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.200]   preachers believed it. And there were many preachers who preached the League of Nations
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.920]   instead of the gospel for a number of years. Poor, blinded men. What did the League of
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:32.120]   Nations lead to? Well, we had another war in 1939. But still, you know, they bring forward
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.520]   their schemes. United Nations, they call it now. It's the same thing. And they still put
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.920]   their trust and their faith in it. So they've trusted to politics, they've trusted to education.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.160]   You see, I remember the arguments very well. There are some advantages in being old, you
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.720]   know. And one of them is this, that one can remember the confidence in liberalism with
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:02.100]   a small l, before and after the First World War. I used to hear this argument, and I often
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:08.800]   used to argue with people. There was the problem of delinquency, juvenile delinquency, and
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.680]   robbery and things of that kind. And this was the argument. They said, "This is due
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.520]   entirely to the conditions in which these people are brought up." They said, "What can
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.160]   you expect from a poor boy who's brought up in a slum, never had enough food, never had
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.000]   adequate clothing, and whose housing was deplorable?" They said, "While you've got poverty and these
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.440]   conditions, you're bound to get delinquency and crime."
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:41.400]   Well, now there's a terrible crime problem today. What are they saying now? Well, what
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.960]   I read now is this. They say that all this crime is due to the fact that the young people
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.720]   have got too much money in their pockets, and they don't know what to do with it. It's
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.000]   burning in their pockets, so they must be doing something. You see, the exact opposite
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.840]   of what they said before. But still, they're producing their schemes and their ideas. Education
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.280]   was going to solve the problem. Science, likewise. Philosophy. These were the things that were
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.000]   going to introduce paradise. Men and women turned their backs on the chapels and the
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.680]   churches, and they followed the political and the philosophical and the sociological
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.060]   and the educational leaders, and they really believed they were going to solve the problem.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:30.020]   They put forward their schemes. But what of their schemes? According to these men, the
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:40.060]   schemes in his age were empty and futile and vain. And I'm here to say the same tonight,
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:46.820]   and you can't dispute it. All the schemes and the plans are breaking down before our
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:54.180]   very eyes. We're in terrible trouble morally, politically, industrially, economically, socially,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:03.300]   and in every other respect. The schemes of men are vain and futile and empty. And of
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:11.260]   course, every really deep-thinking man throughout the centuries has always come to this conclusion
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:16.780]   and has always recognised this, whether Christian or not. You see, Shakespeare was not
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.580]   a Christian, in my opinion, but he was a very able and a profound thinker and observer of
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:27.540]   humanity. And he came to this conclusion. He saw what was happening, and he came to
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:35.740]   this conclusion about life. He said, "Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:43.860]   and fury, signifying nothing." That was Shakespeare's conclusion. But take another
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:51.020]   man, take the great historian Edward Gibbon, who wrote about 200 years ago. He wrote a
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:58.740]   famous book called The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Gibbon wasn't a Christian,
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:04.780]   but he was a very able historian, and he took a wide view and sweep of the history of the
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:12.460]   human race. And he was an expert, particularly, on the Roman Empire. And do you know what
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:18.580]   he said history was? This is Gibbon's, not mine, but not a Christian's, this is Gibbon's
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:26.100]   verdict on the history of mankind, the history of civilisation. He said, "History is little
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:36.180]   more than the register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind." That's it. It's
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:46.260]   a register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind. Isn't it true? Come along, let's
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.620]   face the facts. One of the greatest thinkers in Russia in the last century, and they produced
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:58.180]   some mighty thinkers, was a man called Hertzin. Do you know what he said about history? This
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:07.740]   is his description of history. He said, "History is the autobiography of a madman." That's
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:17.060]   history. It's the autobiography of a madman. He said, "The world is mad." But come along,
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:23.980]   let's come right up to date. I read not so long ago a description of history and of the
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:32.580]   story of mankind and civilisation by a modern writer who again is actually opposed to Christianity.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.880]   And you know how he described it? He said that the state of the world today is nothing
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:46.620]   but organised insanity. Organised insanity. Oh yes, it's very highly organised, but it's
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:53.300]   insanity. Isn't it insanity to be building these bombs instead of building hospitals?
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.020]   Isn't it insanity to be fighting one another and see the country go down instead of working
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.220]   together? It is insanity, but it's highly organised, isn't it? And that's the man's
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.900]   description. It is organised insanity.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:14.860]   Let me give you a final quotation. And I turn to this very deliberately. I'm going to quote
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.620]   from a man called Marquise. Now some of you may remember that about 10 years ago and a
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:29.220]   little over, there was a student revolt in America, in Germany, and in France. It looked
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:35.780]   as if we were going to have a revolution. And the man who was really behind this was
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:42.700]   this man, Herbert Marquise. He was the man to whom the students turned. They'd long since
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.780]   turned their backs, of course, upon Christianity. That was foolish. That was folklore. That
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.860]   was something out of date to be laughed at. They turned to this man, Marquise, and they
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.900]   read his books and they followed his reading. And that attempted revolution by the students
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:04.540]   was based on the writings of Marquise. But you know, this is what he wrote. He said,
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:13.300]   "What precisely has gone wrong with Western civilisation, that at the very height of its
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:24.180]   technological progress, we see the negation of human progress, dehumanisation, brutalisation,
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:32.700]   revival of torture as a normal means of interrogation, the destructive development of nuclear energy,
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:40.980]   the poisoning of the biosphere, and so on?" And he ends with a question, "How has it happened?
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.820]   What is the matter? Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?" Marquise
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:53.620]   was anti-Christian, and yet he looks at modern civilisation and he says, "What's gone wrong?
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:59.300]   Here is Western civilisation at the height of its technological progress, but it's the
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:07.300]   reverse. It's the negation of human progress. We've become dehumanised. We're uncivilised.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:14.500]   There is all this torture. There is this poisoning of the biosphere. What has gone wrong? How
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:21.540]   has this happened?" Well, now then, my friends, there you are, you see. The modern world is
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:27.940]   back in the condition that it prevailed nearly 3,000 years ago. David asks his question,
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:33.980]   "Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?" Marquise asks, "What has happened?
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:41.220]   What's gone wrong?" That's the world in which you're living. Now then, there is a fact which
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:48.420]   is incontrovertible. That's a description of the state of affairs. But wait a minute.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:57.500]   We come now to the next and the very important question. Why is this? I've only been describing
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:04.700]   it and I've read to you these quotations from these great men who describe it and simply
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:13.900]   ask why is it? And they can't answer the question. They have no answer. I defy you to produce
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.660]   an answer from any one of them. Make notes the next time you listen to the clever men
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:24.100]   on the television in their discussions and you'll never find an answer. They're good
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.620]   at raising problems, analyzing the condition, but they can't tell us why it's happened.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:37.540]   Here is the problem. Why is it that in 1979, with all the advantages we have had of education
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:44.460]   and everything else, why is the world in this critical condition of this hour? And there
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:52.380]   is only one answer. It is the answer given in this book. These poor men and women who
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:59.380]   put forward their futile and empty schemes have never really faced the question as to
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:05.940]   what is the cause of the problem. And there is only one answer. The answer that is given
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:14.020]   in this psalm. It is man's rebellion against God. There's no other answer. Nothing else
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:22.860]   explains it. Man's rebellion against God. And you notice the psalmist tells us that
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:29.380]   this is true of all kinds. The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:35.340]   together. It's not only Tom, Dick and Harry in the docks in Cardiff who are living this
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:41.420]   terrible life. The kings and the princes, the philosophers, the scientists, the great
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:48.660]   men, they're in it. The kings and the rulers, they're all in the same predicament. The
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:55.300]   problem of alcoholism is not confined to the working men. It started amongst the aristocracy.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.420]   Divorce didn't start with the common people. It's the aristocrats who started it. The
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:06.060]   kings, the princes, the rulers, all are involved in the same trouble and in the same predicament.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:16.540]   But why is it? And the answer is, as I say, it is man's rebellion against God. The kings
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:24.580]   of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:33.260]   against his anointed. And you see it's something deliberate. We are not merely facing a slackness
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:39.180]   in mankind. There was a time, two hundred years ago and more, and even last century
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.200]   up to a measure, when men committed sins and didn't live a good life, but it was mainly
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.540]   negative and a matter of slackness. It's no longer that. Listen, they set themselves and
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:33:01.020]   they take counsel together. It is deliberate. We are living in an anti-God age, in an age
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:09.100]   when men and women of a set purpose and with pride are turning against God and defying
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:15.820]   him and setting themselves deliberately to disobey him. Now then the question is, why
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:23.180]   do they do this? And the psalmist tells us, they set themselves and they take counsel
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:30.220]   together against the Lord and against his anointed saying, "Let us break their bands
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:39.700]   asunder and let us cast away their cords from us." What does this mean? Well it means this,
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:47.900]   that mankind in its folly turns against God and rebels against him because they believe
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:54.500]   that God is against them. Their view of God is of some tyrant sitting in the heavens keeping
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:00.700]   us all down, binding us up with bonds and bonds and cords. "Ah," they say, "you
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.780]   have ten commandments and you have some and other amount. That's your Christianity.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:10.700]   It's always telling you not to do things. It's always tying you down, standing between
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.980]   you and liberty and freedom, standing between you and what you enjoy and what you like to
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:21.460]   do and what you have a right to do. It's tying you up with bands and bonds and cords.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.380]   That's your religion," says the modern man, "and I don't want it." That's
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:34.660]   the attitude towards God. They believe that God is against them and that his holy laws
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:42.140]   are inimical to our best interests and to our great advantage. But this is the whole
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:48.780]   trouble with the situation, and I can prove it to you quite simply. Look at this attitude
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:56.420]   towards morality, towards law, towards the ten commandments in particular. People feel
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:03.060]   that they're against us, and yet when you come to examine the position, you find that
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:10.820]   God gave these laws not to hold us down, not to bind us and to bend us, but for our good
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:16.660]   and for our benefit. Have you ever thought of this? Take the much maligned and criticized
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:23.620]   ten commandments. God tells us to worship him, not to bow down to images. What's
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:31.900]   wrong with that? God tells us not to worship idols, not to worship graven images. Is that
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:38.100]   a scandal? Is that a legalism binding us? Is it wrong to tell a man not to worship a
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   motor car? Is it wrong to tell a man not to worship a footballer or a pop star? Is it
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.740]   wrong to tell a man not to worship his money? That's what the ten commandments tells you.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:57.420]   But wait a minute. Come on to the practical details. Thou shalt not kill. Is that a restraint?
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:03.140]   Is that a grievous band and bond tying you down and standing between you and a glorious
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:11.260]   life? Is it wrong to ask you not to kill? Thou shalt not steal. Is that some reprehensible
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:18.100]   prohibition? Telling you just not to steal? Do you want to have liberty to steal? Thou
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:23.900]   shalt not commit adultery. What's wrong with that? Why do people hate God for saying
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:30.980]   thou shalt not commit adultery? Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.020]   Thou shalt not malign your neighbor's character or say untruths about him. Thou shalt not
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:42.180]   covet or desire thy neighbor's wife, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor his manservant, nor
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:48.100]   his maidservant. Tell me in the name of God what's wrong with these ten commandments?
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:54.100]   Is it a band and a bond to be told not to do these things? My dear friends, have you
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:01.780]   ever realized this? If only everybody in the world today kept the ten commandments, there'd
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:09.140]   be no more drunkenness, no more alcoholism, no more drug addiction, no more war, no more
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:15.700]   theft, no more robbery. The world would be paradise. And yet people say these are bands.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:22.180]   Let's break their bands. Let's tear their bonds asunder. God's against us, they say.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:28.260]   But God gave you the ten commandments in order to make life possible and to make it decent
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:34.020]   and to make it good. And the whole tragedy of the world tonight is that it doesn't keep
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:40.260]   the ten commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. But here is mankind in its enmity against
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:48.940]   God. That's what it is. Regarding God as an enemy, the Apostle Paul says the natural mind
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:57.180]   is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. The world
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:02.180]   has been trying to get rid of God for a century and laughing at him and ridiculing him. And
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:09.980]   they do it with confidence. Let us, let us set ourselves, they say. Let us break their
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:17.220]   bands asunder and cast away their cords from us. The fatal confidence of mankind that it
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:23.940]   can get rid of God and all his holy laws and commandments. It is madness. As one of the
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:31.220]   men I've already quoted put it, it is organized insanity. The history of mankind in its rebellion
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:37.940]   against God is the autobiography of a madman. But let me turn to that and demonstrate to
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:46.940]   you. Let me show you the utter terrible folly of this rebellion against God and this idea
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:54.420]   that we can live a happy and a good and a full life without God and in defiance of his
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:05.300]   teaching. It is sure madness. It is lunacy. What's it based upon? It is based as the psalmist
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:15.980]   upon an ignorance of God. This is the central cause of all our troubles tonight, that we
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:25.660]   don't know the truth about God. You know, our Lord Jesus Christ, just before his death,
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:32.620]   he offered up a prayer to his father. It's recorded in the 17th chapter of John's Gospel
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:40.980]   and we call it the High Priestly Prayer. And at the end of that prayer he said this, "Oh
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:51.620]   righteous Father, the world has not known thee, but I have known thee. And these,"
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:56.180]   pointing to the disciples, "have known that thou hast sent me." Now there he is just before
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:01.380]   he died on the cross. He said, "The trouble with the world is, oh Father, that it doesn't
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:07.980]   know thee. The world has not known thee." And you know, I could prove to you tonight
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:14.860]   in detail that every one of our problems is due to the fact that we don't know God. That's
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:21.340]   why there's no law and order. That is why there is this chaos in every realm and department
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:27.100]   of life. Every man is out for himself, does that which is right in his own eyes. People
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:32.100]   say, "I want this, I'm going to have it. Why shouldn't I?" There is no respect for law
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:40.060]   because there is no belief in the supreme law giver. But David says God is. This is
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:46.100]   how he puts it. "Here are the mankind, the kings and the rulers and all the people, saying
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:52.340]   together, 'Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us.'" What's
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:41:08.580]   the answer? "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh. The Lord shall have them in derision."
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:18.020]   That's the one you're defying. "He that sitteth in the heavens." This isn't man's world, it's
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:27.620]   God's world. And God is there. God is the everlasting Jehovah, sitting in the heavens
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:35.140]   above the flux of time. And he looks down upon us in our cleverness and in our arrogance,
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:40.300]   trying to get rid of him and trying to make a perfect world. "He that sitteth in the heavens
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:51.740]   shall laugh." The Lord looks down upon us with unutterable derision. God is God, the
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:42:04.300]   everlasting God. "Great Jehovah I am, immortal, invisible, God only wise," as our hymn put
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:13.820]   it. "Wide as the world is thy command." It's vast, it's eternal. My dear friends, we're
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:22.100]   not dealing with men. The world is as it is because it's defying the everlasting, illimitable,
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:30.660]   eternal God. And this is amazing, that mankind can be so mad and so foolish as not to believe
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:37.300]   in him. I'll show you the ultimate madness of the present race of men. The average man
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:43.100]   today doesn't believe in God the Creator any longer. They've long since ceased to believe
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:49.620]   in that. The Bible starts by saying in the beginning, "God created the heavens and the
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:57.020]   earth and the sea," and so on. The modern man is too clever to believe in God the Creator.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:06.180]   But you know what he does believe in? He believes in a chemical compound called the DNA molecule.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.180]   He believes in that. You go and ask the modern atheist, the man who doesn't believe in God,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.740]   and who doesn't believe that God created the world, go and ask him, "How has this world
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:22.260]   come into being?" And this is what he'll tell you. He'll tell you there was some original,
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:28.620]   undifferentiated protoplasm. Well, you say, "How has man come out of that? How have all
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:34.140]   the animals come out of that? Where has poetry come from? Where has love come from? Where
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:41.500]   has music come from? How has that undifferentiated matter developed into man with all his greatness
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.820]   and his intellect?" And you know what they'll tell you? They'll say that in the nucleus
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:54.260]   of every cell there is this chemical molecule called DNA, and this has produced everything.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:44:00.180]   This has determined everything. This guides everything. Now, the DNA molecule hasn't got
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:09.020]   a mind, hasn't got reason, hasn't got understanding, it hasn't got a will. And yet the modern man
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:15.260]   who doesn't believe in God the Creator, the Almighty Creator, is prepared to believe in
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:23.820]   the DNA molecule if that isn't madness what is. The world is mad, my friends. The learned
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:30.380]   men should be capable of believing in the determining power of a chemical compound and
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:36.340]   yet rejecting the everlasting and eternal God. But God is God. "He that sitteth in the
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.940]   heavens shall laugh." He is the Creator of the ends of the earth. He is one who can issue
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:49.060]   his decrees as David tells us here, and he has almighty power. He does laugh. He can
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:54.300]   have them in derision. "I will declare the decree. Ask of me and I will give thee the
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.260]   heathen." God is the God of providence. Read your Old Testament and see the hand of God
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:05.900]   guiding the world and all its peoples, picking out a people called the Jews, delivering them
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:11.140]   when in trouble, giving them conquest of the mighty enemies, the God who sent the flood
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:17.220]   to destroy that arrogant generation, the God who smashed the tower of Babel when men thought
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.340]   they'd build a tower to heaven as they're still thinking, the God who has intervened
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.740]   and sent his own people to captivities in Babylon, the God who destroyed the city of
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:34.020]   Jerusalem through the Roman power to punish his own people, the God who is at the back
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:41.420]   of everything. He's still there and his power is illimitable. And if you want a final proof
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:47.420]   of his power, David gives it us in the sixth verse of this psalm, "Then shall he speak
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:57.980]   unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:05.340]   my holy hill of Zion." What's that a reference to? That is a reference to the resurrection.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:11.540]   The clever world, the kings and the princes and the rulers conspired against Jesus of
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:17.300]   Nazareth. They said, "This fellow who says he's the son of God, let's get rid of him."
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:22.300]   And they joined together. They took counsel together and they said, "Let's break their
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:28.340]   bands asunder and cast away their cords from us." So they took him and they condemned him
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:33.020]   and they nailed him to a tree. They killed him. They took down his body. They buried
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.460]   it in a grave. They rolled a stone over it and sealed it. They put soldiers to guard
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:43.500]   it. They said, "That's the end of him. We've finished him." But the morning of the third
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:53.020]   day God raised him from the dead. "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion."
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:47:00.620]   The resurrection is the final proof of the illimitable power of God. This is the God
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:09.140]   that the world is defying. But not only his power, his wrath. God's wrath is upon sin.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:16.100]   He shall speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure. As certain
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   as we are here tonight, we are under the judgment of God. But my dear friends, I can't leave
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.580]   you at that. If that was all that the psalmist had to say, it wouldn't be worth listening
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:36.180]   to. If that is all I've got to say, you've been wasting your time. Let's go on. Here's
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:43.540]   the final word of the psalmist. He's described the condition. He's explained to us why it
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:54.340]   obtains. He's shown us its utter folly, its madness. And then he goes on to show what
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:48:03.380]   a terrible tragedy it is. And this is the real trouble with mankind. For God is not
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:12.140]   only a God of judgment and a God of wrath. He is. He's a holy God. God is light and in
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:22.540]   him is no darkness at all. He hates sin and his wrath is upon sin. But it isn't only that.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:31.340]   They're rising up against not only the Lord, but against his anointed, against his son,
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:38.180]   the one to whom he said, "Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee." And this is
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:45.100]   the amazing thing. And that is why I'm here tonight, my friends. I'm becoming an old man.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:51.940]   It's 52 years since I first preached in Cardiff. Why haven't I retired? I've been ill. Why
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.900]   am I not sitting in the corner at home? Why have I come here again? And I've come here
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:03.780]   for this one reason, that the tragedy of mankind worries me. That men and women don't know
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:08.500]   what they're doing. They're not only defying the everlasting God, they're rejecting the
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:18.140]   love of God, the Lord's anointed. For this is our message, that God so loved the world
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:28.980]   that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:35.820]   everlasting life. This is the tragedy. That's the tragedy that the men in their prayer in
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:44.820]   the early church were referring to. That the world rejected Jesus of Nazareth, son of God.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:51.300]   Why did he ever come into the world? He tells us himself, "The Son of Man is come to seek
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:58.620]   and to save that which is lost." He said the Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto,
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:04.740]   but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. And this is the essence of the madness
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:12.500]   and the tragedy of the world, that God is offering mankind free pardon, free forgiveness.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:18.860]   He laid your sins upon his Son. The death of Christ on the cross of Calvary was not
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:25.300]   the death of a pacifist. It's the death of the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:31.180]   the world. God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, and whatever your sins may have
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:36.780]   been, however black your life may have been, though you've entered the very jaws of hell,
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   if you but acknowledge it and realize it, and ask God for mercy and pardon and forgiveness,
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:50.100]   he will tell you that he's already given it you. That he sent his Son into the world to
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:56.900]   bear your sins in his own body on the tree. That he smote him instead of you. That he'll
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:02.860]   pardon you, he'll forgive you, he'll receive you to himself, he'll make you a son, he'll
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:09.140]   adopt you into his family, and he'll begin to showers his blessings upon you. That's
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:16.980]   what this man is saying. And so he makes his final appeal. Be wise now therefore, O ye
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:27.380]   kings. Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. This is our business. I'm here to ask you
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:33.620]   to be wise, my friends, to be instructed. I'm not here to entertain you. I'm not here
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.540]   to dance before you or to sing to you. There's too much singing today. We need thinking.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:44.500]   We need reasoning. We need to be instructed. We need to be wise. Here is the only message
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:51.740]   that's asking you to face the facts tonight. There is no other. And these are the facts
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:52:01.420]   that I've stated before you. And so he urges us to be wise and to be instructed. And then
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:09.180]   he tells us the most interesting thing in the last verse. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:18.580]   and he perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Now this to me is
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:30.140]   a most tremendous thing. Kiss the Son, he says, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:39.180]   That's my view of the world tonight. The world tonight is as it is because the wrath of God
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:47.140]   is kindled but a little. In our cleverness, we've been saying as mankind for a hundred
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:54.140]   years, we don't need God. We can make a perfect world without him. With our education and
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.660]   culture and science and politics, we can make a perfect world. We've been telling God this.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:04.820]   We don't want him. We've turned our backs upon him. We're breaking asunder his bands
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:11.340]   and his bonds. And do you know what's happening? I can tell you. Why have you had the two world
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:18.940]   wars? Why the turmoil and the raging tonight? Why the breakdown of all our institutions?
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:25.900]   And here's the answer. God in his wrath is turning to us and saying, "You've said you
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:32.580]   can get on without me. Get on without me." He's allowing us to get on without him. He's
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:38.620]   withdrawing the restraining influence of his blessed spirit. He's allowing us to reap the
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   consequences of our own actions. But this is only a little. This is the wrath of God
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:51.660]   kindled but a little. There is worse to come. Christ said that evil men shall wax worse
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:59.220]   and worse. Christ never promised a perfect world developing as the result of his teaching.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:05.940]   He said there shall be wars and rumors of wars. It's the philosophers and the poets
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.660]   have said there's going to be an end to war. Christ says there's going to be trouble and
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:19.060]   turmoil. It's going to get worse and worse. There'll be a great tribulation until he comes
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:30.540]   and gives the only final answer. We are experiencing the wrath but a little. What of the future?
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:36.020]   Have you got economic security? Have you got financial security? What's going to happen
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.660]   to this country? What's going to happen to Western civilization? What if they let off
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:46.380]   these bombs? These are the dreaded possibilities. Is there to be a world famine? Is there to
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:55.660]   be a world war? Be wise. Consider these things. These are but manifestations of the wrath
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:04.540]   of God, but a little. But a day is coming when this blessed Son of God, this Christ,
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:10.340]   this Messiah, this Anointed of God is going to come again into the world riding the clouds
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:16.500]   of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels. He's coming to judge the world in righteousness
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   and every eye shall see him. And according to John in his vision on Patmos, the kings
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:29.380]   and the rulers will run and hide themselves under the rocks and under the hills saying,
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:38.620]   "Hide us from the wrath of the Lamb." Then the wrath will be poured out upon a rebellious
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:46.180]   humanity, upon kings, princes, and people who have rebelled against God and cast asunder
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:54.300]   his holy laws in their arrogance and in their volley, but above all upon those who have
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:56:03.860]   refused the gracious offer of God's free pardon and forgiveness by simply acknowledging the
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:13.580]   sin and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed are all they that put their trust
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:24.620]   in him. My dear friend, have you been wise? Have you been wise? Have you considered these
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:30.500]   things? How are you going to live the rest of your life? You don't know how long it's
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:37.660]   going to be. How are you going to live it? How are you going to die? How are you going
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:50.100]   to face God? How do you face the unknown future? Be wise. Be instructed. Do what the psalmist
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:56.340]   says. Kiss the sun. You see the picture? You've read, haven't you, when a new government
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:02.060]   comes in, the various ministers have to go to Buckingham Palace. There they're given
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:07.020]   the seals of office by the Queen. You know what they do? They kneel before her and they
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:15.100]   kiss her hand. It's called the kissing hands. They kiss hands. That's their sign of subjection
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:21.260]   and she gives them the authority. That's exactly what David is telling us to do with God. Kiss
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:29.540]   the sun. Kneel and bow before him. Kiss his prophet hand. Give yourself to him. Serve
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:37.740]   the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling and you'll be blessed. Not only while you're
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:45.620]   left in this world, you'll die a glorious death and you'll go on to share the glories
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:53.140]   of eternity with Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with the spirits of just men made perfect
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:58:03.260]   and all the holy angels. Very well. That's the message. It's all here, isn't it? In words
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:15.780]   written nearly three thousand years ago. Are you wise? Have you received the instruction?
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:24.580]   I leave it with you as you value your eternal destiny and your immortal soul. Listen to
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:35.020]   the appeal of David. Be wise. Kiss the sun. Yield yourself and your life, your future
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:45.540]   and everything to the Lord Jesus Christ. He has said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:55.260]   thee." That's his word. He's never broken it. Be wise. Trust him. Follow him. Give yourself
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:01.820]   and reserve it to him and you'll be more than conqueror over everything that can ever come
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:10.340]   to meet you. Let us pray. Oh Lord, our God, we thank thee that in a world of chaos and
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:18.020]   of confusion and of trouble thy word still speaks to us. We thank thee for it that thou
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:25.380]   hast not left us to our own vain and futile devices and imaginings but that thou hast
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:31.340]   sent thy Son into the world and though the world rejected and crucified him and killed
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:38.140]   him and buried him thou didst raise him again from the dead and set him on thy holy mount
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:46.180]   of Zion and in him thou art offering to receive us back tonight to pardon and forgive us,
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:52.780]   to make us thy sons and to prepare us for the inheritance that thou hast awaiting us.
[00:59:52.780 --> 01:00:01.980]   God save the people. God have mercy upon a mad world. Oh Lord have pity and compassion.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:12.020]   We ask it in the name of thy dear Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
