[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   There's this really good YouTube video about Photoshop when it was first released.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.280]   I would think about the early 90s. It's kind of like a late night show and they're discussing
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.720]   like the ethical implications of manipulating images in magazines. And they're like,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.360]   "Should we allow to manipulate images and put them in magazines?" And half of the panel was like,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.560]   "No, we shouldn't." It breaks the essence of what photography is, right? And 20 years after that,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.840]   it's like it makes no sense to think about not doing something like that, right? And so there's
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.480]   always like an adaptation process, I would say, where people need to and we need to collectively
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.840]   ask like, "Hey, how is it going to be used?" But I think ultimately you understand what the
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.760]   limitations are and you also fine tune your eyes and your understanding of the world to make sense
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320]   of that thing, right? And now everyone knows that Photoshop is a verb that you can use to describe
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.760]   something that's manipulated, right?
