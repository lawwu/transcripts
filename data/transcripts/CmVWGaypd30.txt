[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.720]   the portion of scripture we read in the book of the Prophet Isaiah in chapter 63 and the
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.960]   first six verses. The first six verses in the 63rd chapter of the book of the Prophet
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.920]   Isaiah. Who is this that cometh from Edom with dyed garments from Basra? This that is
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.920]   glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength. I that speak in
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.120]   righteousness, mighty to save, and so on. Now as we come to consider this paragraph
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.480]   here at the beginning of this 63rd chapter of Isaiah's prophecy, it is of very vital
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.640]   importance that we should see it in its setting and be clear as to the connections. Those
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.080]   who were here last Sunday morning will remember that then we were looking at the 62nd chapter.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.880]   And we were doing so in order that we might see how the Prophet was facing the desperate
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.560]   condition of the Church, then of course the nation of Israel, as it was in his day and
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:35.880]   in his time. She was despised, she was in a sad condition, forsaken, desolate. Her enemies
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.080]   were taking her products, the corn, and drinking the wine. And the whole condition of the children
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.480]   of Israel and of the city of Jerusalem, Zion, God's Zion in particular, was deplorable.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   And there we saw the Prophet's reaction to this, and how he decided to watch and pray.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.680]   He is going to set watchmen upon the walls, and he is going to urge the people to pray
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.360]   without ceasing, not to give God rest, not to take any rest themselves, until Zion shall
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.840]   be restored once more, and until Jerusalem shall be appraised in the earth. The position,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.680]   you remember, was desperate, and it led to these desperate measures. It was a call to
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.400]   action to face the urgency of the situation. And there we left the Prophet, exhorting his
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.200]   people and pledging himself, thus to give themselves to waiting upon God, that he might
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.960]   send relief and restore unto them again their ancient position of privilege and of power.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.060]   Now here we come suddenly to this extraordinary picture that we have in these six verses.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.440]   And of course at first glance one might very well be tempted to feel that this is something
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.500]   that has been interpolated. It does not seem to have any direct connection. The Prophet's
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.520]   prayer goes on in the seventh verse. The seventh verse continues more or less what we left
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.000]   off at the end of chapter 62. But here is this paragraph which comes suddenly into the
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.320]   midst of his prayer and his great act of intercession. And of course there have been those who have
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   said that this is something quite extraneous that has just been thrown in here. Those who
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.840]   do not believe in the unity of this book of the Prophet Isaiah, but regard it as a collection
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.880]   of odd prophecies given at various times and patched and pieced together by some general
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.160]   editor, they of course are perfectly ready to say and do say that this should not be
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.240]   here at all at this point, but that it belongs somewhere else. It was a vision given to the
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.680]   Prophet on some other occasion but unfortunately it was put in here and it interrupts the prayer.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:14.080]   Well of course that is just to display a complete lack of spiritual insight, an appalling ignorance
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.200]   of the ways of God with his people. That is how such men, with their rationalism, always
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:30.560]   miss the brightest glories of the Christian experience and the Christian life. No, this
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.760]   is not an interpolation. This is one of the most characteristic actions of God with respect
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.800]   to his people. Well, what is it? Well, it is this. Here is the Prophet in this desperate
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.600]   situation, exhorting and urging his people to join him in watching and in prayer. And
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:02.280]   the position is desperate. So God looks down upon them and realizes their weakness and
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.720]   the desperate plight, and he just grants them an encouragement. He just does something which
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.200]   enables them to continue in prayer and in watching. And that is what we have in these
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:24.280]   six verses. This is a vision that was given to the Prophet, a glimpse of the ultimate,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.920]   in order that he might not faint nor falter, but that he might continue and enable his
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.280]   fellow countrymen to continue in waging this great fight in the spiritual realm. In other
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.680]   words, it was given, I say, to encourage him and to strengthen him. And this is one of
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.760]   the most typical actions of God with respect to his people. And that is why I am calling
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.840]   your attention to it this morning. We have need of encouragement in the fight in which
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:05.040]   we are engaged. Indeed, we would not be able to continue at all were it not that God gave
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.160]   us from time to time these encouragements. Oh, our hymn books are full of this kind of
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:19.720]   thing. Sometimes a light surprises the Christian while he sings. It is the Lord who rises with
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:28.480]   healing in his wings. He does it periodically. Suddenly there is a break in the clouds and
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:36.040]   the flash and the streak of sunlight. It is given, I say, by God in his graciousness,
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.960]   in order to encourage us, in order to help us to go forward. We are called upon to face
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:49.120]   the situation. It is dismal, it is dreary, it is trying, it is wary. And our tendency
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.280]   as we saw last Sunday morning is to fail and to faint. And I say that we would all faint
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.800]   were it not that God periodically does the very thing to us that he did at this point
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.880]   to the prophet Isaiah and to the children of Israel.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.120]   Very well, then. What we have to realize this morning is this, that there are certain things
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.400]   that we have to remind ourselves of constantly. The Scriptures have been given, as we are
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.960]   told by the Apostle Paul in the New Testament, not only for an example, but also for our
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.840]   encouragement. He talks also about the consolation of the Scriptures. That is why the New Testament
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.880]   Church in her wisdom was led by the Holy Spirit, you see, to incorporate these Old Testament
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.880]   Scriptures with the New. It is the same God acting. And what he did, he still does. These
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.640]   things are written for our encouragement, for our example, for our consolation. This
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.440]   is how God still deals with his faithful people.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.320]   And therefore I want to suggest that what we are going to look at this morning is the
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:06.640]   greatest possible encouragement to prayer and to intercession. And it is only to the
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.920]   extent in which we do grasp the meaning of this great picture, this vision that was given
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   to the prophet, that we shall be able to continue in a way that is likely to lead to the blessing
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.840]   of a mighty visitation of the Spirit of God.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.440]   Now then, here we are. This is God's way. The problem, exhortation, then as we start,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.600]   just an encouragement, lest we become discouraged even before we start. Very well then, let's
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.560]   look at it. What is it? Well, I say it is a vision. The prophet suddenly was given a
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:52.080]   vision of someone coming up from Eden, and from Basra, which was the capital of Eden.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.240]   He comes up and he is marvellous to behold, but the thing that at once attracts the attention
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.920]   of the prophet is that his garments are stained with blood. Here comes someone obviously who
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.160]   has been engaged in a great fight, in a great skirmish. And yet at once it is obvious to
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:18.440]   the prophet that he is a victor, he is a conqueror. He has been through a most bloody skirmish,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:26.720]   and yet he has triumphed, and here he is bespattered with blood, coming in the power of his might.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.080]   What does this mean? What is the message which is here for God's people?
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:39.200]   Well, there is really little difficulty about this. You have noticed that that nineteenth
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.120]   chapter of the book of Revelation, in a sense, is a most amazing commentary upon all this,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:53.840]   and there are other places in Scripture that do the same thing. Eden is always used in
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:02.160]   the Scripture to signify and to represent the powers that are opposed to God and his
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:11.800]   people. Eden comes originally from Esau. So if you like, you see it is the picture of
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.760]   the contrast between Jacob and Esau. Esau the profane, the man who does not get the
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.040]   birthright, the man who values other things more than a birthright, a mess of pottage,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.400]   the worldly outlook, everything that is opposed to God and the things of the Spirit.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.320]   Now as you read your Scriptures, you keep your eye on this word Edom and the references
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.040]   to the Edomites, and you will always find that they stand in the Scriptural typology
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.880]   for the enemies of God, the ultimate enemies of God, those who are set against God and
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:53.920]   his glory and his people. And so, as you read about them in the Scriptures, you will find
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   that they stand for those who literally and actually oppose the children of Israel. They
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:09.000]   did so as the children of Israel were going to enter into the promised land of Canaan.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.120]   They did so on many subsequent occasions after they had entered the land of Canaan. They
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.520]   are the traditional enemy of God's Israel in the Old Testament, the Edomites, these
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   people who live in Edom. But of course, it doesn't merely stop at that. These Edomites
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:37.240]   also represent the powers that were opposed to the Lord Jesus Christ. It doesn't matter
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:44.360]   who they belong to, what nation they come from, symbolically this is Edom. All the forces
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.840]   and the powers that were arrayed against the Son of God, that's spiritual Edom. And of
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.440]   course, in the same way, it represents the opposition and the enmity that was displayed
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:04.720]   against the early Church, because the Church had not long come into being before persecution
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.600]   arose and attempts were made, as you remember, to exterminate her. There's a great illustration
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   of that in Acts chapter 12, but there are many others. These powers that gather together
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:24.320]   to try to stifle and to kill the early Church. And also, it represents the power that has
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.000]   been there and has been opposing the Christian Church throughout the centuries. If we've
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.120]   seen nothing else during these past months when we've been considering this question
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.200]   of revival, I do trust it has given us a sense of history. The Church is fighting for her
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   life today. This isn't the first time. This has happened many a time before. Edom remains.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:56.000]   Edom is always watching, ready to pounce upon us, ready to destroy. Edom, spiritual Edom,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.080]   has been there, and often times she has been highly successful, very triumphant, and the
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:12.240]   Church seems to have been moribund and almost dead. Very well, it is still the same, I say,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:20.600]   today. And all the powers and the forces that are arrayed against us are typified by Edom.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.720]   The kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of hell, the kingdom of the devil, the kingdoms of
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:32.520]   this world—that's Edom. And I needn't waste your time this morning in reminding
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:42.080]   you of the whole situation in which we find ourselves. We are back, as we saw last week,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:52.600]   in this same condition as obtained in this period in Isaiah's history—forsaken, desolate.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:14:00.000]   But finally we've got to bear this in mind, that Edom also represents the forces that
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:11.920]   will gather together for the last and the final attempt to defeat God and his Christ
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:21.440]   and the Christian Church. A mighty battle, an Armageddon—that's Edom. All this power
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.480]   that hates God and would bring him down, mustering its unseen arrays for the final conflict—Edom.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:37.080]   Now then, let's bear that in mind. Edom, in Scripture, represents all that always.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   So now you see the picture which has been painted here by the Prophet in his vision.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   And it has been the custom of the Church, therefore, in ages past, indeed throughout
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.480]   the running centuries, when she has been fighting for her life and has been faced with the very
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.160]   fact of extinction, it has been the custom of the Church to recur to this passage. And
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:06.760]   it has often put new life into God's people. They had perhaps been praying for years, but
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.960]   nothing happened. The enemy seemed to be waxing stronger and her power seemed to be waning.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.720]   And they were beginning to think whether it was worthwhile going on any longer. Everything
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.800]   was going against them. Suddenly they've come back to this and have seen the vision
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.000]   coming anew and afresh. And they've taken fresh heart and they've gone on praying.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.720]   May God grant that that will be the effect of looking at this vision this morning, as
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:39.280]   far as we are concerned. Are you faint and weak? Are you feeling discouraged? Are you
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.680]   feeling a sense of hopelessness with regard to the whole future of the Christian Church
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:50.080]   and of God's call? You know something about these powers? We are constantly being told
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:16:00.280]   about them. In this country, in other countries, what can avail us? Is there any hope for us
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.640]   at all? Well, now I say there's nothing more important than that we should keep our
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:12.120]   eyes open, that we should be watchmen upon the walls, keeping our eye upon the horizon.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.280]   Keep your eye on the hills. Is there any hope? There's none here. Well, let's look into
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.560]   the distance. And this is what happens. You see, here we are in our desperate position.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.400]   We've organized our forces. We are praying. We are watching. And yet we wonder how can
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:39.240]   anything save us when suddenly somebody cries out saying, "Who is this? Who is this that
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:50.080]   cometh from Edom with dyed garments from Basra?" And immediately there is a new hope. Into
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.680]   the midst of the darkness and the despair and the hopelessness, this person suddenly
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:05.360]   appears. "Who is this?" And so the story proceeds. And that is what we have to do this
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:16.060]   morning. We simply have to remind ourselves of this blessed person. The only hope. The
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:26.400]   last hope. Yes, but the certain hope. "Who is this?" Let's look at him together. Let's
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.320]   stop looking at London and its parks and all the rest of it. Let's look at him. This is
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.960]   what the Church needs to do. To lift up our head. To look at him. "Who is this?" Let's
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.000]   stop looking at communism. Let's stop looking at materialism and science and all the things
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.960]   about which we hear so much and about which we talk so much. Let's turn away from them.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.480]   "Who is this?" Here's the hope for the Church. Here is the way to be encouraged in prayer
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.560]   and in intercession. "Who is this?" You know, my friends, our trouble is due to the
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.240]   effect that we're looking so much at these other things that we've forgotten the truth
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:11.960]   about him. And hence our excitement and our feverishness and our sense of despair and
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:24.200]   of hopelessness. No, no. Our business, I say, is to look at him. And what do we see? Well,
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:32.760]   the first thing that struck the prophet is the glory of his person. "This that is glorious
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:44.000]   in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength." Here is the point at which
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:55.880]   we must ever stop. The word translated "traveling" really means "stately." "Glorious in his apparel,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.760]   stately in the greatness of his strength." What a person he is. Have a look at him. Who
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:08.200]   is this? Come and see. Take a glance at him. Come along, cries the prophet. You despondent,
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:14.320]   discouraged people. Come and have a look at this person. Who is this? And they stand back
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:23.520]   in amazement at the sight of his glory, his stateliness, his dignity, his majesty, his
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.120]   power. Here is a deliverer coming up out of Eden. There's been a great fight. He's conquered.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:50.000]   Who is he? Here is the only hope for the church, to behold him. Who is this so weak and lowly?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.880]   Who is this who works as a carpenter? Who is this who lies asleep in the stern of a
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:07.600]   ship, who is hungry and who is thirsty? Who is this who is arrested and tried and condemned
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   and put to death in apparent weakness and expires upon a cross and is buried in a grave?
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:27.000]   Who is this? And thank God we know the answer. The King of Glory, the Son of God.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   My dear friends, that's the whole of Christianity. That's the whole meaning of our being together
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.740]   here this morning. In all our situation, this is the thing I say that we must hold on to
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:50.200]   and never look at. Our Savior is the Son of God, none other. Of course, this is the great
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.840]   theme of this prophet. You remember how when he turns to this aspect of his prophecy in
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:01.080]   chapter 40, he introduces it immediately in putting it in these words, "The voice of him
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.520]   that crieth in the wilderness, 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.560]   desert a highway,'" for whom? For our God. "Every valley shall be exalted, and every
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.520]   mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:21.440]   places plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:34.160]   for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." That's it. It is this mighty, glorious person,
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:42.240]   none other than the everlasting, eternal Son of God. The prophets and the psalmists in
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:49.280]   their prophetic moments, they all saw this. In the depths of Israel's despair and hopelessness,
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.920]   a psalmist cries out, "He hath laid help on one that is mighty." "What are you looking
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.640]   at?" they say. "Why do you only look at your enemies? Look at him. He hath laid help on
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:06.600]   him, on one that is mighty." What is our hope this morning? It is this. Great is the mystery
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:17.320]   of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh. We look out upon the world. We remember that
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.120]   the psalmist said in the eighth psalm, talks about the heavens and the sun and the moon
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.080]   and the stars, and says, "What is man? All things have been put under men." But we look
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:32.440]   round and we say, "We don't see them put under men." You say the Christian church is
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.880]   the church of God, but look at our positions as somebody. Attacked by the Edomites, defeated
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.760]   by our enemies, struggling to keep going, resorting to this and that, everything against
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:51.520]   us, desolate, forsaken. We don't see all things subdued unto us. "No, no," says the author
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:23:01.760]   of the epistle to the Hebrews, "we don't." But, we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.320]   That's it. And because we see that, he says, we see everything. Let them despoil us of
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.400]   our goods, let them put us to death, let them massacre us, let them do what they will. We
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   see Jesus, and because he's there, we are going to be there. He is the anchor within
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:24.560]   the veil. We see Jesus crowned with glory and honor. And it is only the Christian people
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:30.160]   who can see him crowned with glory and honor, who are confident and assured this morning,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:42.520]   and who can go on with their prayers and with their intercessions. Who is this? It is the
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:52.160]   King of glory. It is the Almighty Son of God. We are not left to ourselves. He is on
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:59.360]   our side. He is amongst us. He is in the camp. Well then, let me hurry on to other things
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:07.080]   that we are told about him, but there is the point at which we must ever start. If I believed,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   as some do, that Jesus of Nazareth was only a man and not the everlasting Son of God,
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.720]   and that our only hope this morning was that we had got his teaching and that we must strive
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.480]   to put it into practice, I would, of all men, be the most hopeless and the most pessimistic.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:29.280]   I would say, "Let's shut down the church. We are done for. It's the end." But he
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:41.600]   is the everlasting Son of God. He is the King eternal, immortal, invisible God in the glory
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:54.240]   of his apparel, in the dignity and the stateliness of the greatness of his strength.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   And then we go on to read about his righteousness. He answers himself. The prophet says, "Who
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:10.400]   is this?" He says, "I that speak in righteousness." Here is his great characteristic. He is the
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:20.920]   King of righteousness. His whole concern is with righteousness. The world is full of lies
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:39.120]   and deceit and vanity. Because God himself is righteous, and God is just and holy, and
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.680]   God made a perfect world, and it was a righteous world. But sin and unrighteousness came in,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:54.880]   and he is concerned about righteousness. It is the passion of his life. And he came into
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:03.100]   this world because of righteousness. He is described as the branch of righteousness,
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:11.320]   the righteous branch. That's why he came. Sin is disorder, sin is unrighteous, sin is
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.460]   lawlessness, sin is rebellion, and God is righteous. And the whole object of this person's
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:25.440]   coming is to bring righteousness back. His one concern is righteousness. That's why he
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:35.840]   taught as he did. That is why he died as he did. God hath set him forth as a propitiation
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.800]   for our sins that he might be just, righteous if you like, and the justifier of him that
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:52.400]   believeth in Jesus. The whole object of salvation is the restoration of righteousness. Righteousness
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:27:00.120]   in earth as well as the righteousness that is in heaven. His object is to produce a state
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:07.920]   in which peace shall be like a river and righteousness as the waves of the sea. That's it. I speak
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.040]   in righteousness. This is my dealing. This is my conversation. This is my way of thinking.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:22.560]   Everything is concerned with righteousness. He is the truth. He is the light. Yes, it
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.960]   means that, but you know, I think it means another thing which is very comforting and
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:34.840]   it's this. He speaks in righteousness, which means this, that there is no equivocation
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:43.480]   in his speech. There is no uncertainty. He has given a promise. He has outlined his proposal.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.920]   He has indicated his plan. And he says to his trembling, frightened people, "I speak
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:58.200]   in righteousness. What he hath promised, he will most surely perform. For his mercies
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:06.000]   they endure, ever faithful, ever sure." One of the designations applied to him, you
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.600]   remember in the book of Revelation, is faithful. He is not only righteous, he is faithful.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.280]   And discouraged people, remember this this morning, whatever may be happening round and
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   about you, he has promised, he has said, and he will most surely perform. "I speak in
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.200]   righteousness, but I must hurry on. I am trying to give a composite picture this morning.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.080]   We could stop for the remainder of the time on any one of these descriptions and ascriptions
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:41.200]   which are made to him here, but I hurry to mention another thing which he repeats."
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:49.720]   You notice that there is a repetition of anger and of fury. The prophet asks, "Wherefore
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.120]   art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-fed?"
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.640]   He answers, "I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people there was none with
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:05.880]   me. For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood shall
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:11.040]   be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:18.880]   is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And again, I will tread down the
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:25.280]   people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and will bring down their strength
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:33.480]   to the earth." There is nothing more comforting than that. Do we realize what it means? It
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:42.920]   means this. This is our comfort and our hope this morning. His anger and his fury are against
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   these Edomites. He said, "There was nobody to help me, but therefore mine own arm brought
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:59.600]   salvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me." There he was left alone to fight this terrible
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   power, and he says, "My fury it upheld me." Thank God for the fury. What does it mean,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:14.040]   says someone? Well, let me put it in more ordinary terms by putting it like this. Righteousness
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   and the glory of God are his passion. That is why he came from heaven. He came from heaven
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.880]   primarily to vindicate God's glory and God's honor. No, not just to save us. That is incidental
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.360]   in a sense. Don't misunderstand me, but the great motive was the glory of God, which had
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:40.960]   been violated by the devil and by sin. Christ has come to reestablish, as it were, the glory
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.760]   and the honor of God. He is furious against Edom. His anger is roused against the enemies
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.800]   of his holy and his righteous Father, and he was consumed by a zeal for God's house.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:03.200]   Didn't he say so? "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." I know of nothing more
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:11.440]   comforting than this. We see something of the might and the fury of the enemies of God
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:18.880]   of modern Edom. What can be done about all this? Can you and I organize a way of quelling
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.000]   it and controlling it? We are patently failing. Things are going from bad to worse in spite
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.240]   of all our efforts. He is evil to triumph over all. Can nothing be done with the forces
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:35.560]   of hell? Here is my only comfort. He, the blessed Son of God, hates it all. With a divine
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:46.760]   and a holy hatred, his wrath is upon it. His fury is against it. He is determined to crush
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:55.320]   it and to quell it and to destroy it, that God's name and glory may reign over all and
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.720]   his people may be redeemed. His anger and his fury.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:06.800]   The next thing, of course, he emphasizes is that this is his conquest. Though stained
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.840]   with blood and bespattered in this way, as if he had been treading down vines in a wine
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:19.760]   press, he has triumphed. He has slaughtered them. He has destroyed them. He has crushed
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:30.840]   them. And you remember another emphasis is upon the fact that he has done it alone. "I
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:37.800]   have trodden the wine press alone, and of the people there was none with me. And I looked,
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.760]   and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold. He trod the
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:52.360]   wine press alone." And we must emphasize this for a moment because it is the great
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:33:00.520]   central fact about Christian salvation. It is the great theme of the Bible from beginning
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:07.600]   to end, and it is just this, that the work of salvation is entirely and only and exclusively
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:16.080]   that of the Lord Jesus Christ. Nobody has a share in it. There was nobody with him.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.720]   All that has been done, he has done alone. The first prophecy tells us that the seed
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:31.680]   of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head, and it is one person, this person.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.360]   You remember how the Apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Galatians, chapter 3, goes
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:42.200]   out of his way to emphasize this point. He said the promise was to Abram and his seed.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:49.880]   He says, "Notice, it doesn't say seeds as of many, but of seed as of one." Yes.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:55.240]   There came a point at which the people of God came down to one person, and it was this
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:04.600]   blessed person who had taken unto him the seed of Abraham, and not the nature of angels.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:12.280]   He and he alone became our representative in the fight. And how often did he refer to
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:18.440]   that? How often was he lonely? Every man went into his own house, I read at the end of John
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:24.200]   chapter 7. Jesus went into the Mount of Olives. Why? Well, he hadn't got a house. The lonely
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:30.320]   Jesus, alone. You remember how towards the end he said to these disciples of his who
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:38.080]   were protesting their loyalty, he said, "The time is coming when every man shall leave
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:46.240]   me and forsake me, and I shall be left alone." Do you remember in that terrible moment of
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.640]   agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, he selects Peter and James and John out of the twelve.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.760]   He takes them into the garden. Then he leaves them and goes on alone. There they were. He
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.720]   asked them to remember him and to pray and to intercede. They slept. He went on, and
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:10.440]   alone he was in an agony. Alone. Facing this ultimate question, the drinking of the cup,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   "If it be possible, let it pass by. Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done." Alone!
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:26.800]   With no one to help, he takes the cup. Alone, nevertheless. And we read, "They all forsook
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:33.320]   him and fled." Peter denied him. The bold, impulsive, self-confident Peter, who protested
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.520]   that he would go with him through hell. "They all forsook him and fled." He trod the wine
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:48.160]   press alone. He died alone. He took upon himself, upon his own shoulders, the sins of the world.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:55.300]   Alone. And you know, it even continues afterwards. For I read this in the book of Revelation
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:03.400]   in chapter 5. John is given his vision of a scroll, you remember, with the seals upon
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:09.800]   it. The scroll of history. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:14.840]   is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?" And no man in heaven nor
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.760]   in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:26.600]   And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book within, neither
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:37.240]   to look thereon. No man! But the angel said, "Weep not. The lion of the tribe of Judah
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:44.200]   hath prevailed to open the book." When no one else in heaven or earth, nor anywhere
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:50.760]   else can do it, one can. I trod the wine press alone, and he alone is the Lord of history
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:58.840]   and can open the book and tear away the seals.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:05.440]   Salvation is altogether and entirely and exclusively in the Lord Jesus Christ. Don't bring a scrap
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:11.600]   or a shred or a rag of your filthy righteousness anywhere near him. "Him that glorieth, let
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.740]   him glory in the Lord." Don't talk about your goodness and your efforts. It's all in him.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:28.800]   Thank God it is. I trod the wine press alone. He can do it alone. He has done it alone.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.400]   What has he done? Well, in the Old Testament he conquered the enemies of Israel. He was
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.280]   the angel that was with the church, says Stephen in his great sermon. He was the one who appeared
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:46.080]   to Moses in the burning bush. He was the captain of the Lord's host that appeared to Joshua
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.200]   outside Jericho at that moment of crisis. He, the Lord of hosts, the captain of the
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.600]   armies of Israel, the same person.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:04.320]   Oh, we haven't the time, my dear friends. We should be staying here for hours looking
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.360]   at him and considering what he's done. Let me hurry you then to the cross, what was happening
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.880]   there. Well, you see, it was a great fight. It was a great skirmish. All the powers of
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:19.240]   hell were out against him. But this is what happened, says Paul in Colossians 2.15, "And
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.120]   having spoiled principalities and powers, he made an open show of them, triumphing over
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.440]   them. In it, in his death, they thought they'd got him. They massed their last reserves.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.120]   The fight was on. The Edomites brought out their last reserves. But he conquered them.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:44.480]   He smashed them. He put them to an open shame, triumphing over them. He did it alone. No
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:56.680]   one helped him. No one was able to assist him. He, through his one and solitary death,
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:06.520]   destroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. And finally, let us look
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:12.400]   at him. He is dying upon the cross. He expires. They take down the body and they put it in
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.200]   a grave. They roll a stone over it and they seal it. And the soldiers are set to watch
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.800]   and to guard. There he is. He's finished. But wait a moment. What is this I see? Who
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:29.160]   is this? Who is this that I see suddenly standing there upon the shore that morning after Peter
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.880]   and the others had been fishing all night and had caught nothing? There's somebody
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:43.400]   on the beach. Who is this? The grave is empty. They've met together in a closed room because
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:52.600]   of their fear of the Jews. Suddenly someone stands amongst them. Who is this? It is the
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:40:02.160]   same person. He has even triumphed over death and the grave. He has brought life and immortality
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:09.080]   to light. He can look at death and the grave, and so can we, and say, "Oh, death, where
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:16.920]   is thy sting? Oh, grave, where is thy victory? Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious. See
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:24.080]   the man of sorrows now, from the fight returned victorious. Every knee to him shall bow."
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:36.160]   Have you seen him? Look, you saints. Lift up your heads. Look at him. Who is this? It
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:42.400]   is the King of Glory. Lift up your heads, ye everlasting doors, and let the King of
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:54.840]   Glory enter in to the glorious, royal, eternal reception of heaven. That is what he's done.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.560]   And you know, throughout the running story of the Church throughout the centuries, he
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.120]   has been doing the same thing. The Church has been dying. She has been finished. Suddenly
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.160]   he just appears, and his enemies are scattered, and the Church is revived. That's what is
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:15.120]   meant by revival, times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord. That is what revival
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:21.160]   means, that the Church has another glimpse of the vision. The Church sees him, and seeing
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:32.760]   him can smile and laugh at her foes and all her enemies. Revival is always his work. He
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:39.200]   always treads the winepress alone. Of course, he uses men, but don't you give the praise
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   to men? I don't care who they are, whether they're Kelvin or Luther or Wesley or Whitefield
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:52.360]   or anybody else. He treads the winepress alone. It is when he arises with healing in his wings
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:58.240]   that the enemy is defeated and the Church is revived. It is always he and he alone.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:07.400]   And revival means to see him in his glory and to turn to him and to pray to him.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:14.400]   There it is, I've brought you up to date, but wait a minute. There is a great and a
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:25.680]   mighty day coming, a day that passes in glory and in amazement anything that we can even
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:33.440]   imagine. There is a day coming when there will be a sight of someone coming on the clouds
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:39.760]   of heaven, riding upon them, surrounded by his holy angels. And the peoples will cry,
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:45.640]   "Who is this? Who is this that is coming?" And the answer is the same, this majestic
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   person that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength, the King
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:59.120]   of Kings, the Lord of Lords, coming for the final battle, the ultimate defeat of all that
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:09.040]   belongs to him. It is all there, as you've already seen, in that nineteenth chapter of
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:16.800]   the book of Revelation. He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:24.720]   called the Word of God. He shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the winepress
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:31.720]   of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:39.640]   and he's come to finally destroy every enemy and everything that is opposed unto him. And
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:45.920]   I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, yes, all the empires of
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:51.640]   this world, all your isms, your communism, your materialism, your scientificism, and
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.120]   all the rest of them. I saw them all, and their armies gathered together to make war
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.920]   against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.760]   him the false prophet that brought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.960]   had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:16.320]   cast into the lake of fire, burning with brimstone, and the remnant was slain with the sword of
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth, and the fowls were filled
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:29.860]   with their flesh. Do you believe that? That's coming. It is coming. We live in the hope
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:36.600]   of that. This is the essence of Christianity. He is coming. Are you frightened by these
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:47.520]   present enemies and foes? He will destroy them by the word of his mouth and by the brightness
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:56.040]   and the glory of his coming. The hell that seems to be let loose upon the earth today
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:04.360]   is itself going to be destroyed completely until there shall not be even a vestige left
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:13.080]   behind. He will come to do it. The Christ who came as a babe of Bethlehem, the carpenter,
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:19.840]   the son of Mary, will come in his glory and his full majesty. And the whole world, every
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:26.000]   eye shall see him, yea, and them that smote him, that pierced him. And the kings and all
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:37.280]   the great ones will be humbled and defeated. The crowning day is coming, by and by. Christian
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:47.800]   people, have you seen him? Have you been amazed by him? Have you cried out in astonishment,
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:54.520]   Who is this? Who is this that has saved me? Who is this that guarantees my eternity? Who
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:59.440]   is the Lord of the church? And do you know the answer? I say there is nothing more wonderful
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:12.040]   than this. To belong to such a person, to be a citizen in such a kingdom, to belong
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:22.560]   to such a saviour. Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God. He whose
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:32.800]   word cannot be broken formed thee for his own abode on the rock of ages founded. What
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:44.720]   can shake thy sure repose with salvation's walls surrounding? Thou mayst smile at all
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:50.760]   thy foes, look at them again and look at them with contempt, smile upon them, laugh at them.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:56.480]   Even the devil resists him in the name of Christ, and he will flee from you. What a
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:04.360]   privilege to belong to such a king. What a joy and a comfort and an encouragement to
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:11.120]   know that his victory is assured, that his triumph will be complete. Very well then as
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.400]   we find ourselves today, let us look to him, let us plead with him, let us ask him to give
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.920]   us a visitation, a sort of sample of what he is going to do, and encouragement in the
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:27.800]   meantime, let us ask him to arise and to blow upon these enemies and to lift us up again
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:38.280]   and make us mighty in his strength and power. What a privilege to be able to do so. Is there
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:45.120]   on the other hand anything more terrible or more appalling than this? Not to belong to
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:53.220]   him? Oh, the tragedy of men and women who belong to the world and not to Christ and
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:48:00.240]   his kingdom. Are there any of you in this congregation this morning? You who live for
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.080]   the world and who ravish and your hearts are ravished by it, and who delight in it and
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.600]   who apologize for your Christianity, you whose heart is with the world and not with this
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:17.880]   Christ. Do you know that if you die like that a day will come when you will be trampled
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:28.760]   under his feet as grapes in the winepress and destroyed from the glory of his presence
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:37.220]   and the enjoyment of his blessed company? Christian people, that is going to be the
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:47.480]   fate of all unbelievers. Doesn't that press upon your mind and heart and spirit? Doesn't
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.240]   it alarm you? Don't you pray for them? Don't you ask for God to empower his servants? Don't
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   you pray for revival? They are going to hell. They are going to be crushed beneath his feet.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:05.840]   Don't you think it is about time we began to feel the burden of their souls upon our
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:13.200]   spirits? Don't you think we should be praying without ceasing, asking him to give power
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.600]   unto his gospel, to visit us and to revive us, and to give us this might and this authority
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:26.000]   that will be irresistible, that they may be saved from the wrath to come? Yea, from the
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:37.560]   very wrath of the Lamb, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. Well, dear
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:42.360]   my dear friends, is the encouragement that was given to the prophet, thank God it is
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:50.840]   given to us still? Have you seen him? Have you asked? Do you now ask, "Who is this?"
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:50:06.040]   My Lord, my God, my Savior, my Redeemer, my all in all.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.120]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
