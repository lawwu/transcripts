[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - These days I hear a ton of really desperate stories,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   mostly from young guys.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.920]   I've heard from maybe four or five women on this,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.920]   but literally thousands of young men about porn addiction.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.080]   Every time I hear about it,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.720]   I feel so fortunate that I grew up in a time where,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.020]   or maybe I just don't have the wiring for it.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.040]   And if I did, I would be, I'm pretty open on this podcast.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.320]   I, it's never been an issue for me.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360]   And they're telling me that they can't stop watching porn.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.860]   I get the sense that they're not enjoying
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.000]   this experience anymore because they're reaching out to me
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.560]   saying, how in the world can I quit?
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.260]   And what do I tell them?
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.000]   - I remember, and again, I don't know this study,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.760]   but I remember somebody referencing many years ago
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.840]   when I was first getting in the field that porn addiction
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.680]   at the time, specifically related to video pornography,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.660]   which is what it all is now, right?
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.320]   It was having the same impact on the brain and young men
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   as crack cocaine.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.160]   I mean, it's extremely powerful.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160]   Has a lot of other effects in that it sets up a very unrealistic
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.120]   idea and perspective of what sex and intimacy is.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.920]   It also can help or can lead to kind of setting their sexual template.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.680]   You know, they can quickly escalate, just like you would escalate,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.200]   kind of back to the hot fudge sundae where it doesn't work anymore,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.120]   from something that might seem like normal sex to violent sex to really out there things that
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.000]   can bring a lot of shame that they're even watching, and it can escalate quickly.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.080]   And then have an impact on their own lives and relationships, because they're playing out
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.320]   those relationships or that amount of intimacy, depending on what they're doing. Also, if there's
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.240]   masturbation along with it in a fantasy.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.440]   Well, what I'm also hearing is that anytime they are in a real life intimate scenario,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.040]   which seems to be fewer and fewer times nowadays in the younger generation, that they're having sexual
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.680]   anxiety, sexual performance issues, which makes sense if their brain and nervous system is getting
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.240]   wired by porn to observe sexual behavior, as opposed to being in the experience of intimate sex.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   behavior, right? Two different things to be in the experience versus watching someone else's
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.080]   experience of it, which is what pornography is.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.160]   Yeah. This was probably 10, 15 years ago, where we're treating some, but we were treating a lot of
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.760]   soldiers that had come back from Afghanistan or Iraq. And, you know, they had access, this was like
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   the first wars where they had access to the internet. And there's a lot of other things. So there was a lot of
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.880]   kind of combining of sex and violence, right? They're around a lot of violence, and then they're watching
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.480]   sex. And then that kind of sexual template would set around, like, in order for them to get pleasure out
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.640]   of sex, it would need to be aggressive or even violent or very risky. You know, so there's all these
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.120]   things that kind of collapse together. There were other things going on. It was like the first time that
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.320]   they had also really had access to video chats to be able to, like, be on a battlefield and then come
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.880]   back and be talking to their spouse about something that's going on with the kids. It was a very
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:51.760]   confusing environment for those guys, men and women. You know, the porn addiction is a tough one,
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.520]   you know, because it's everywhere. I mean, now you can find it on any social media, almost. Maybe not
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.720]   anyone, but it's not really limited, you know. And even if it's not, you know, I know certain states have
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.600]   just put in where you have to put in your ID to get it, but there's tons of ways around that and
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.520]   other sites that people can go to. And I've run into that with a lot of, it does seem to be young
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.960]   men, you know, and it's a way for them to play out some sort of fantasy around connection and
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.400]   relationship. And it makes their world really small. I don't think it's the same as gambling,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.760]   but it can make it, it can make their world very, very small in that they're, instead of
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.040]   finding relationships out in the world, and it's not necessarily a relationship, but they're what they
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.480]   believe they're getting out of a relationship, they're then getting out of watching porn.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.640]   It seems like basically stopping completely is the answer. And people say, and I'm not trying to
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.680]   moralize here, right? I'm not telling people what's moral about this. I just know that any behavior or
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.880]   substance that leads to quick repeated inflections and dopamine is going to create a groove in the
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.360]   nervous system where you're going to crave that thing. And it's going to give you a lower and lower
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.840]   sense of satisfaction over time. And the only way to reset that circuit is to stop and do something else
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.680]   in its place. Ideally, that's adaptive.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.360]   These are people that are asking you how they can stop. You know, they're telling you, I can't stop.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.800]   How do I do it? So it can be similar to other addictions. You know, I mean, first,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   the admission part that it's a problem or awareness that is, and then being able to start to talk to
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.920]   somebody and start to take some accountability around it. Not accountability like you're doing something
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   wrong, but to be able to have some sort of identify the behaviors that start leading to that. You know,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.160]   I mean, there, uh, that can be done in therapy and there's other 12 step groups that can help people
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   with that to identify what their sobriety would look like. If you want to call it sobriety, what it looks
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.360]   like. And if it does involve not watching any porn, then that's the rule set that they have. And then they
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.840]   figure out either with their therapist or in their treatment center or with their sponsor or community
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.120]   in 12 step, like, how am I going to be held accountable to that? And that might be doing
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.920]   the things like we talked about laying out, looking at your, your day ahead at the beginning, they might
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.840]   need to look at things like, you know, uh, there's ways and software out there to not be able to look
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.680]   at that on your phone or have an accountability partner that can, you know, you have to, they have
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.840]   to approve websites you go to. And, and that, that, that's not to say that they have to do
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.360]   that forever, but it's something that's available right. You know, 50 years ago or 30 years ago,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.440]   someone had to like find their dad's porno mag somewhere and then look at it. You know,
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.360]   now it's on their phones or computers. Well, we know that accessibility,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.080]   increasing accessibility increases addiction, right? This has been studied over and over again. And people
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.760]   say, well, what about red light districts and things? And there's some caveats that have to do
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   with when you, uh, create areas within cities where certain things are allowed, but you know,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.680]   this has been tested many, many times. Um, it's also true and it's kind of a duh, but to quote
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   Anna Lemke, it's impossible to get addicted to a substance or a behavior that you've never taken
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.960]   or engaged in. Right.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.560]   So some things are best avoided entirely. Um, are there specific 12 step programs for porn addiction
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   that are separate from say sex addiction?
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.160]   If you, people look it up, I'm sure there's meetings out there that, that are specific to
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.480]   that. There are, um, some treatment centers that have tracks that deal specifically with that.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.200]   There's therapists that work very closely with that. And I, I believe that there are some 12 step,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.400]   I mean, there's pretty much 12 step programs for any sort of, you know, within things like SA or SLA,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.640]   there'll be subsets of meetings for people that are with a very specific condition.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.400]   And one of the reasons I wanted to discuss this today is because I hear about it so much is
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.040]   unlike alcohol or drugs, there's a kind of extra layer of shame associated with,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.320]   with pornography addiction for people. Um, you know, so many times we've heard,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.600]   oh, like this celebrity was an alcoholic or drug addict, you know, wrapped their car around a pole,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.440]   was arrested, this and that, then they get sober and everyone still loves them, loves them more.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.480]   Right. If we knew that a given celebrity was like a porn, porn addict or something,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.520]   we look at that person differently, especially if they're male, we just look at them differently.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.720]   And so reducing some of the shame around it, I think it's key to, to helping them recover.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.320]   Because I can tell you there's the, the questions initially came in kind of like, as is often the
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.600]   case with, with men, when they're trying to talk about issues that they were kind of cloaked in,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.320]   like, what are your thoughts about NoFap? Which is this thing where guys, um, withhold ejaculation.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.640]   Okay.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.840]   Does it increase testosterone? It turns out in the short run, it does. In the long term,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.360]   it's probably not good for the prostate, et cetera. But then it turned out they were really asking about
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:54.400]   masturbation. They were really asking about pornography. And then all of a sudden, I don't
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.000]   know what changed out there, but there's been this deluge of, of questions from young guys of how they
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.600]   can stop engaging in online porn. A key to that is what you said about, we look at them differently.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.200]   You know, they're going to keep it secret, you know, and there's a saying secrets keep us sick,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.920]   but I believe there's like a real, almost a biology to that. And that, you know, if you're
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.480]   holding it in, not sharing it, you know, where there's no really place for it to go, but shame
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:30.800]   and shame separates us and separate. We're not connected and not connected. We're alone and alone.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.560]   We're, you know, we keep carrying that forward alone. We're dead, you know, maybe not in that sense
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.000]   anymore. Like we talked about earlier, but like, we're not really living. And so they're, you know,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:50.000]   these guys are hearing you on a podcast and then DMing you, right? They're probably not in
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.280]   a personal close relationship with you, right? It's easier to send it there than maybe go ask for help
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.640]   with somebody in their area or go to a meeting or something like that because of the stigma.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.200]   So it's good that you've opened up the ability for people to do that, but to continue to direct them
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.720]   back to, you know, let's try to treat this like we would any other addiction, at least from the
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.440]   standpoint of you've got to talk about it. You've got to have some sort of admission. You've got to be
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.400]   able to find a community around it. You want to be able to do work, you know, most likely with a
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   therapist or a team of therapists that can help you understand what's driving that behavior.
