[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   At root, what is sin?
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.560]   This was the question John Piper sought to answer in his message, "What is Sin?
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.640]   The Essence and Root of All Sinning" at our 2015 Pastors Conference.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.280]   Here's a clip of what John Piper said.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.960]   So my definition of sinning goes like this.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.360]   Sinning is any feeling or thought or speech or action that comes from a heart that does
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.240]   not treasure God over all things.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:49.400]   Sinning, sins, actions called sins are any thought, feeling, speech, action that come
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:59.520]   like fruit or branch, shoot out of the root of the heart that prefers anything to God.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.960]   A few years ago I attempted to define sin, therefore, like this.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.880]   And this is the root, not the branch.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.760]   Sin is the glory of God, not honored.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.320]   The holiness of God, not reverenced.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.920]   The greatness of God, not admired.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.680]   The power of God, not praised.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.440]   The truth of God, not sought.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.240]   The wisdom of God, not esteemed.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.880]   The beauty of God, not treasured.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.000]   The goodness of God, not savored.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.100]   The faithfulness of God, not trusted.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.160]   The promises of God, not believed.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.780]   The commandments of God, not obeyed.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.640]   The justice of God, not respected.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.160]   The wrath of God, not feared.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.720]   The grace of God, not cherished.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.520]   The presence of God, not prized.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.480]   The person of God, not loved.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:07.720]   Why is it that people become so emotionally and morally indignant over poverty, exploitation,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.620]   prejudice, abortion, infractions of our religious liberty, manifold injustices of man to man
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:28.120]   and feel little or no remorse or indignation or outrage that God is disregarded, disbelieved,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.840]   disobeyed, dishonored, and thus belittled by millions and millions and millions of His
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.440]   creatures?
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.340]   This clip was taken from John Pepper's message, "What is Sin?
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.060]   The Essence and Root of All Sinning," from our 2015 Pastors Conference.
