[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   Okay
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.060]   Well buckle your seatbelt because I think this next thing is probably going to shake some of your thinking
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.360]   if you guys have want to be
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.620]   Provoked one of the most provocative books you can read
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.400]   Is by a gentleman by the name of Charles Murray called?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.760]   I think it's called breaking apart anyways. It's it's basically a study on sociology and
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.000]   There's a guy a younger version named Rob Henderson who I randomly met on the internet a few years ago
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.160]   And Rob story is pretty incredible. This is a guy that had a drug-addicted mother. He bounced around foster care his whole life
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.120]   he
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   Dropped out of high school
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.400]   I think he joined the Air Force left the Air Force and then went to Yale and then got a PhD from Cambridge
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.120]   But he has had an incredibly hard life, but is an incredibly happy
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.080]   kind thoughtful human who's pretty introspective about
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.800]   Just society and sociology and people
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.560]   If you don't have a chance to follow Rob on Twitter, I highly encourage you to do it. He's got an incredible
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.400]   newsletter
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.600]   it's just fascinating stuff about human psychology and
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.760]   He's gonna give us a little presentation then we're gonna have a conversation. So Rob Henderson everybody
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.760]   I did graduate high school 2.2 GPA bottom third of my class
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.500]   So I've I've been developing this framework of luxury beliefs for a couple of years now
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.480]   So we'll just jump right in we'll start with with a puzzle
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   what do top hats have in common with defunding the police or
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.640]   romanticizing unmarried parenting or divorce or promoting careerism over attentive care for children and
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.480]   Family before we get into it Chamath told you a bit about my unusual background. I was born here in Los Angeles
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.000]   I grew up in foster homes here in LA and all around, California
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I fled as soon as I could
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.120]   enlisting in the military when I was 17 and then later attended Yale on the GI Bill and tend a PhD from University of Cambridge and
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.200]   Throughout what will Yale was a very different environment for me. I learned at Yale that there are more
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.120]   students from families in the top 1% of the income scale than the entire bottom 60% and some of those personal experiences along with my
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   sort of academic research led me to a
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.120]   Discovery, which is that luxury beliefs have to a large extent
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.840]   replaced luxury goods
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   Luxury beliefs are ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class while often inflicting costs on the lower classes now to be clear
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.120]   I'm not saying that luxury goods no longer signify status
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.440]   Rather are making the point that luxury goods have become a noisier indicator of status
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.240]   and as a result luxury beliefs have
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.060]   Arisen and as well as we'll see later a core feature of a luxury belief is that the believer is comfortably insulated from the
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.520]   consequences of his or her
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.760]   belief
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.440]   So there are multiple components to this luxury belief idea, but it starts with Thorsten Waeblin
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.000]   He was an economist and sociologist in the late 19th century and in 1899
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.520]   He published a book called the theory of the leisure class and one of the core insights of this book
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   Is that because we can't be certain about the financial status of other people a good way to size up their means is to see
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   Whether they could afford
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   Expensive and costly goods. So in Waeblin's day, these were things like tuxedos and top hats and evening gowns pocket watches and monocles
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.480]   partaking in expensive leisurely activities like golf or beagling
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.020]   attending expensive and lavish events kind of like
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.520]   So there's a
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.120]   There's a great line in this book
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.920]   Waeblin somewhat tongue-in-cheek
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.240]   Suggests that even even butlers are status symbols
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.640]   He writes that the the chief use of servants is the evidence they afford of the master's ability to pay
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.880]   So these findings were later echoed a few decades later by the French sociologist Pierre Bordieu in a classic
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.320]   work in sociology called distinction a social critique of the judgment of taste and
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.400]   This in this book Pierre Bordieu coined this term cultural capital
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   and the idea was that the upper segment of society would convert their material resources into
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.400]   Avenues to express and and perform
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.880]   social class through what he called the dispositions of mind and body
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.400]   developing intricate and expensive tastes
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.360]   knowledge of
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.200]   wine and art and other rarefied cultural domains
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.880]   Taste customs opinions habits. He used this term distance from necessity
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.200]   In other words only people who did not work blue-collar jobs manual labor
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.640]   Could afford to invest the time and the resources
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.520]   into performing
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.320]   the class mannerisms of that top segment
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.220]   so one of the points that beer people do and Waeblin made was that in order for a symbol a status symbol to
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.100]   Signify status it has to be rare
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.400]   It has to be exclusive difficult to obtain costly to purchase once a status symbol is freely available to the masses
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   The Elise will subsequently abandon it
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.600]   So there are historical examples of this one that I like here them in the Middle Ages in Europe
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.680]   Spices were difficult to obtain and costly to purchase only the elites could afford them
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.880]   But as European societies colonized India and the Americas and other regions of the globe the cost of spices
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.560]   subsequently declined and the mass public commoners in Europe were able to obtain spices and in response many European elites
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.720]   decided that spices were vulgar and
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.040]   Under the reign of Louis the 14th court chefs banned sugar and spice from all meals except for desserts
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.680]   There's another example here dueling in the American colony so dueling was initially a
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.560]   Practice primarily engaged in by aristocrats. It was a you know, it was something that only gentlemen partook in for honor
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.240]   Famously one of America's founding fathers Alexander Hamilton was killed in a duel against Aaron burr
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.320]   but gradually this practice that was initially confined to the elite spread throughout the colonies and
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.560]   As a result the elites abandoned this practice and then it was subsequently outlawed in the late 19th century
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.000]   So distinction is the key motive here now a couple of years ago
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.280]   There was a great book by the author Michael Knox Barron called wasps the splendors and miseries of an American aristocracy
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.400]   And in this book Barron writes about white Anglo-Saxon Protestants
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.000]   So this was the American ruling class from roughly the mid 19th to the mid 20th centuries
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.520]   And Barron points out that wasps had mixed feelings about their fellow Americans
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.760]   He writes that many wasps viewed ordinary Americans as sunk in moronic darkness
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.060]   And he writes that it is a question whether a high wasp ever supported a fashionable cause
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.520]   Without some secret knowledge that the cause was abhorred by the Bulgarians
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.160]   In other words many wasps would support certain movements and causes and express certain beliefs
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.360]   Because they were so at odds with conventional opinion and it made them look sophisticated and interesting and it allowed them to distance themselves
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   from the commoners
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.720]   And so sometimes when I talk about luxury beliefs when I talk about status people will say Rob
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.520]   Is it really true that elites care so much about status? Is it really something that's so important to them?
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   And the answer is yes
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.920]   The sociologist Emil Durkheim understood this when he wrote the more one has the more one wants since
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:06.200]   Satisfactions received only stimulate instead of filling needs and this is supported by two recent studies both published in
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.920]   2020 by two independent groups of researchers. This is a replicated finding
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   The result was that relative to lower status individuals higher status individuals have the strongest desire for wealth and status
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   So these researchers collected
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   objective measures of status things like socio-economic status level of income occupational prestige
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.720]   educational attainment and found that people who are at or near the top of these measures were the most likely to agree with
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.320]   Statements like it would please me to be in a position of power over others
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.040]   I enjoy having influence over those around me and similar statements involving wealth as well
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   So this is something that that's important to understand the strong desire for status the strong desire for distinction
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.320]   So that's one component of luxury beliefs
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.760]   The other is that this top segment of society also wields disproportionate influence over culture and over policy
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.080]   There was a study in 2014 that received a lot of attention which found that strong support
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.600]   From high-income Americans doubles the likelihood that a policy will be adopted
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.120]   So these are Americans in the top income decile roughly people who earn a hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars or more per year
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.640]   This group wields a lot of influence
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.320]   But it's important to understand that this group is often insulated from
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.000]   The detrimental effects of some of their policy preferences if the outcomes do not are not favorable
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.400]   So this is important to their insulated from from the consequences of their preferences
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:34.480]   So what is an example of a luxury belief? Well in 2020 the defunded the police movement gained a lot of momentum
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.120]   And in early 2021 you gov ran a survey
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.360]   They collected data from a representative sample of Americans and found that the well they found overall
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:50.280]   Americans were very much against defunding the police, but when they broke down the results by income category
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.480]   They found that the highest income Americans were by far the most supportive of defunding the police
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.040]   There was another survey of just Democratic voters and found that white Democrats were far more supportive of defunding the police
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   Than black and Hispanic Democrats
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.040]   And so as a result despite the fact that most people didn't want this many cities across the u.s
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.560]   Subsequently reduced spending for police departments here in LA in New York
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.880]   Chicago Seattle and and many other cities as well
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.160]   And this has contributed to the violent crime wave that we've seen over the last couple of years
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   So these are figures from the US Census Bureau Bureau before 2020
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.960]   which
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.640]   Helps to understand who are the primary victims of crime?
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.840]   So in the US relative to those earned
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.280]   $75,000 or more per year the poorest Americans are seven times more likely to be victims of robbery seven times more likely to be victims of
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.360]   Aggravated assault and 20 times more likely to be victims of sexual assault
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.840]   And again, this is before 2020 if anything these differences are probably more pronounced. So it's important here to understand that
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.360]   That that to not stop crime is to actually victimize the poor. This is luxury belief
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.400]   Here's another luxury belief
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.320]   Torching your own social capital over the last couple of years. It's become
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   trendy among cultural elites to
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.520]   promote this idea of burning bridges social ties over disagreements over social or political views and
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.480]   If you're an upper upper middle class person if you're highly educated
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.880]   Geographically mobile in all likelihood you can probably afford to burn a lot of social bridges and in all likelihood
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.000]   You'll be just fine. But if you're a person who lives at or near the margins of society
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.640]   it would be
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   Unwise to burn your relationships with friends families employers colleagues neighbors and so on and so
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.200]   Expressing this luxury belief may make you look dedicated to your cause of choice
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.760]   but if this belief
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.360]   Spreads throughout society this would this would have detrimental effects for people who are less fortunate
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.160]   but
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.200]   For me the luxury belief that has had the most wide-ranging
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.960]   societal consequences
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.200]   Has been the denigration of the two-parent family. So here are a couple of headlines
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.840]   Let's call the whole thing off. The author is ending her marriage. Isn't it time you did the same?
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.640]   And the nuclear family is no longer the norm good by the way
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.880]   I don't mean to pick on the New York Times here
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.800]   I've written there and I've had friends who've written there
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.440]   But but these are headlines that many cultural least these are ideas that cultural elites believe should be introduced
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.720]   Into society among the educated public
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:28.480]   To be implemented into culture and into policy. So the erosion of family structure. So in nine in 1960
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:35.400]   95% of American children regardless of social class were raised by both of their parents
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.680]   And for the upper class for the upper 20% of Americans
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.080]   It dropped slightly by 2005 to 85%
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:49.040]   So it was 95% dropped slightly to 85% for poor and working-class Americans those in the bottom 30%
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   It was 95% in 1960 and it plummeted to 30% by 2005
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:13:01.720]   Now if you visit working-class blue-collar communities in the US it is an anomaly to see children raised by both of their parents
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.520]   Where I grew up I had five close friends in high school and of the six of us
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.960]   None of us were raised by both of our parents. There was me raised in foster homes
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.520]   I had two friends raised by single moms one friend raised by a single dad
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   I had another friend who was raised by his grandmother
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.400]   Because his mom was addicted to drugs and his dad was in prison
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:24.800]   That is a pretty common snapshot of like what neighborhoods look like in poor and working-class communities now
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.920]   Now there's an element of duplicity here for this luxury belief and some others as well
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.440]   Which is when you ask college graduates about their opinions on family formation and family structure
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.360]   Only a minority only 25% of college graduates think couples should be married before having kids. That's what they say
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   In other words 75% of college graduates either hold a neutral position or think that maybe they shouldn't be married before having kids
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.880]   But then what do they actually do?
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.360]   Well, the vast majority of children born to college graduates are raised by two married parents
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:05.240]   Only about one in ten children born to a college-educated mother is born out of wedlock. So there's this mismatch between words and deeds
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.960]   And here you can see
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.840]   The sort of shocking rise and out of wedlock births and this is primarily concentrated again among the poor and the working class it continues
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.320]   To rise up until about 1920. It was below 5% It skyrocketed since 1960 continues to climb
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:26.080]   So we're we're in unforeseen territory now where children in impoverished environments who could stand to benefit the most
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.360]   From two attentive parents are the least likely to have them
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.920]   And sometimes when I talk about the issue of the family people want to discuss the economics of this
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.720]   There was a study a few years ago
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.440]   Which found that if you wanted to equalize life outcomes for children raised in single-parent homes
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:49.480]   this would require a redistribution of $59,000 a year to single parents to equalize educational and occupational outcomes for
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.160]   Children to match those of two parent families and I think this is an interesting study and I think
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.020]   Economics shouldn't be downplayed, but I think it does
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.080]   Highlight the sort of narrow way that many elites think about family
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.520]   One way to think about this is if you were to ask a child who has two attentive parents
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.760]   Hey, we're gonna take one of your parents away, but it's okay because we're gonna give you $59,000 a year
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.840]   I think very few kids would accept that deal
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   There's more to life than just educational occupational outcomes
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:28.640]   There's a there's a sort of a blind spot here about the social and emotional penalties children receive when they don't have two parents available
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.920]   So wrapping up here
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.320]   Luxury beliefs are the new status symbols ideas movements causes
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.680]   Pierre Bordieu in another one of his great books the forms of capital wrote the best measure of cultural capital is undoubtedly the amount of
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.040]   time devoted to
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.160]   Acquiring it so only through the the process of going to an expensive University
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:54.360]   Listening to the right podcasts reading the right books being immersed in the right environments knowing that you're supposed to say unhoused instead of homeless
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   You know the updating your vocabulary. These are ways for you to signify. I'm a member of this upper segment of
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.520]   society
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.160]   In an interview a couple of years ago the NYU professor Scott Galloway
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   Said the strongest brand in the world is not Apple the strongest brands are MIT Oxford and Stanford academic society
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   We're no longer public servants for luxury goods. These are the places where luxury beliefs are birthed people pay money
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   They convert their economic capital into cultural capital they learn the right opinions to express in these institutions
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.520]   but again luxury belief holders are often insulated from the consequences of their beliefs so as
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.760]   Costly as these beliefs are to obtain for the affluent in terms of downstream consequences
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.200]   They're even more costly for everyone else, and I'll leave it at that period of my book. Thank you
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:51.040]   You ended with something that
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.200]   Is something that's very important to me that I that I talked to you about before which is
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.240]   The destruction of the nuclear family and the impact that has had on US society
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.960]   I
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.560]   Think it's important to just expand a little bit more
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.360]   And I'll give you this provocative lead-in which is talk about you know maybe
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.400]   LBJ and the Great Society and the war on poverty and you know there's a very famous website
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.520]   What the fuck happened in 1971 calm like all of this stuff just just
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.880]   Discuss that again, maybe in a little bit more detail for us. Well. Yeah, I mean there has been a sort of this backfiring effect
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.480]   I think
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.760]   We we just we focus a lot we concentrate a lot on the economic
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:38.440]   circumstances of families and how this may contribute to deprivation dysfunction negative outcomes for kids, but
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:47.020]   One thing that I've learned through reading a lot of developmental and evolutionary psychology research and the things that I write about is that
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.480]   Childhood instability is worse than childhood poverty for
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.520]   future outcomes
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.560]   so in terms of criminality or educational attainment
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.180]   growing up in a very unstable environment is actually worse than
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.240]   Impoverishment and even when you control for income
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:13.280]   Instability is still strongly associated with negative outcomes for kids in other words a kid who's raised by a rich family
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.040]   But say there's a lot of divorce and addiction and a lot of trauma in that family environment
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.600]   That kid will grow up to most likely have worse outcomes than a kid who's raised in a poor family with two parents who?
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.960]   prioritize attentive care and stability
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.420]   And so I think we yeah, we retreat to discussions of economics because no one wants to talk about values
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.920]   No one wants to talk about family anymore
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.040]   I think the Great Society was kind of an example of this of oh, we're gonna solve this all through economics
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   It's this kind of vulgar materialism
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.380]   When you know now we're seeing the sort of downstream consequences since since the late 60s
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.920]   Yeah, I mean the the data point that that may be shocking for some people is in you know black families as an example
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.160]   the economic incentive to not get married
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.280]   on
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:01.120]   You know today dollar adjusted basis was like 92,000 to a black woman to not get married and have a child
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.940]   Explain what that means how that meaning like, you know, Lyndon Johnson's welfare movement was about uplifting a lot of people
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.940]   But unfortunately it created these
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:18.440]   Deep negative consequences that took years to build up and through economics through economic incentives. It was paying you to not be married
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:25.560]   And so what what happened people didn't get married and so it started to create these effects that have been compounding and and again
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.740]   In this weird way in which we work if you have the right label
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.280]   You know, like for example freeberg has made this statement
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:33.760]   But like, you know
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   We can't talk about how bad the inflation reduction act is is because it's called the inflation reduction act frame the same way at LBJ
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.020]   You know, it was this was the war on poverty. And so all of a sudden you sounded like some, you know
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.480]   Insensitive Luddite if you're like, well, I'm against the war on poverty. Well, no, you're not who would be against that
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.080]   So we never really had a chance to talk about it
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.480]   You know Graham Allison actually had some points about this yesterday as well
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.400]   when we were talking the one we've talked about about Rob is the framing of
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:08.320]   People who are homeless versus people who are addicted to drugs, you know in
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.800]   this sort of
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:17.720]   Why would you arrest somebody who is homeless and who is and they actually have a home and they're choosing to live on the street
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.300]   And they have resources and we pay for this in San Francisco and the the issue here
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:29.600]   I think it is in framing and incentives because you actually get paid to come to San Francisco where we also have the lowest cost of
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.280]   deadly fentanyl
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.600]   Understanding of how
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.960]   relationships and societies often work often material prosperity coincides with no longer needing to build relationships anymore or it
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:49.000]   Sort of redirects the incentive structure such that you you no longer want to work or do certain things anymore
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.600]   I mean, it's funny when I talk to sort of more affluent Americans and and you know
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.700]   I talked to them about what's going on with the sort of what's the underclass in in the US
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.800]   I'll suggest that a lot of these
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.080]   Problems a lot of these communities are afflicted by by poverty
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:12.800]   But then when I travel to developing countries non-industrialized countries poor countries and and I talked to them about what's going on in the States
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.120]   They say that's because America is too rich. That's the problem. You know, you don't need to build relationships anymore
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.240]   I mean often if you visit, I mean I was in I was in Malaysia recently and
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.080]   the
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.880]   The poor neighborhoods there are you know, they're far different than the poor neighborhoods that that I grew up in in terms of just sort of material
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.640]   Scarcity and yet
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.480]   People know their neighbors they get married
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.420]   They take care of their friend family and their friends and a lot of this is because you know in America
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.960]   even if you're poor your
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.480]   material prosperity is relatively higher than a lot of other countries and therefore you no longer need to
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.440]   Build relationships quite as much as as you used to
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.800]   There was a line in The New Yorker a couple of years ago sort of this
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.660]   This is a profile piece on poverty in America
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.660]   But one line that stood out to me was that
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.920]   Before the Great Society being poor meant being hungry and now being poor means being on food stamps
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.720]   Which isn't a pleasant thing to be on food stamps
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.680]   But it no longer means that you're actually starving the way that you would in the past
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.760]   So material prosperity and inequality means something different now
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.920]   Where does society go at the limit of all of this?
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.560]   Yeah, I think one thing that we could do is
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.280]   So so Melissa Kearney, she's a professor of economics at the University of Maryland
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.660]   She just released a book called the two-parent privilege and she points out a lot of this sort of the economic issues
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.360]   And I think that's you know, it's fine
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.960]   But I again I think that's kind of a narrow-minded way of looking at this
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.600]   but one thing that she points out that I really like is that elites could do sort of more to to promote values to
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.720]   sort of what
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.600]   Preach what you practice there are ways that we could just speak more about this
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.720]   I think a lot of a lot of people who agree with a lot of my writing and the things that I say
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.320]   They're reluctant to express this publicly
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:46.960]   It's kind of you know
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.200]   One reason why they like me is because I'll say it but I think you
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.240]   one one sort of obligation or duty you have if you are a fortunate member of society is
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.560]   To accept that you may take some slings and arrows for promoting values that you know are good
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.080]   You know if you've lived a fortunate life
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:11.920]   That yeah, there's there's that kind of noblest oblige that I think that we've lost if there's a message to folks here about how
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.920]   We should be telling
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.160]   Other people what some of those high-level values are what would you tell us to be promoting more that we don't I mean?
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.560]   I think yeah marriage attentive care for for children
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.480]   I think that that is that is a big one. I mean it's really interesting when I talk about
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.520]   Marriage a lot of people immediately pivot and they say well
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.080]   Are you saying that it's bad to be a single parent?
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.320]   Are you trying to what denigrate single moms and this seems to be the only domain where people make this suggestion if if you say
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.240]   We should we should applaud college graduates no one ever says oh does that mean we're insulting people who didn't go to college is that?
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.080]   What you're saying and no that's not what we're saying you can you can praise one thing and confer status on on an activity
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.000]   And that doesn't necessarily imply that you're trying to denigrate everyone else
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.080]   So I think this is something that we could do focus more on sort of family
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.120]   early
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:06.480]   Development issues for young kids again childhood instability is a far greater predictor than poverty and yet we spend so much time talking about economics
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:15.140]   Where do you put some of these social movements that you know
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.040]   Now take up and occupy a lot of space in society
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.360]   Where do those fit in in this construct of yours?
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:31.040]   Yeah, a lot of the movement cancel culture. You know trans etc like how do you how do you how do you bucket sort?
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.500]   All that's I mean a lot of that is those are many of them are luxury beliefs
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.360]   if you look at data in terms of
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   self-censorship is one that I've that I've been been writing about and concentrating on if you look at the data for
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.100]   Americans who report self-censoring for fear of damaging their employment prospects or getting fired
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:55.320]   It actually increases the more educational attainment someone has so for people who?
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:01.800]   The highest level of education is a high school diploma about 25% of Americans say that they self-censor
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:08.560]   Whereas for people with college graduate for college degree, it's 33% and then for people with postgraduate degrees. It's 44%
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:14.240]   Because they have more to lose and they know and they can anticipate what's going to happen
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.880]   Right because because cancel culture and all these things are actually worse
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.960]   We had this conversation with the vague on the podcast where I asked him because he's been very outspoken about his religious beliefs
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.600]   And I asked him a two-part question. Do you think there's anything wrong with being gay?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.840]   And then no and then hey, what do you think of trans and in the fact that?
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.240]   Trans issues have become such a prominent issue in this election
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.200]   When it affects such a small number of people is perplexing
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.380]   Well, I think yes moral movements often become intertwined with with status
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:50.320]   So for a long time, there's the gay marriage issue and because you know, I I cited that the book on wasps
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.560]   You know if a cause is abhorred by the Bulgarians, you know, and and so for a long time
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.840]   that was the case with with gay marriage, but then once a
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   Great, you know a majority of Americans supported this cause I think a lot of highly educated
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   Activists decided to move on to this next issue
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.440]   And so there's there's just kind of you know
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.240]   And any any time an opinion is at odds with conventional opinion?
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.120]   It becomes more enticing to promote because it signifies that you're not a commoner
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.480]   Is that because of social media and is it waning?
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.240]   Some of it is I think because of social media
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.280]   social media scales
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.840]   Right, you you know, you you can't you can't punch a thousand people in the face at once
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.520]   But you can get a thousand people to attack one person online all at the same time and damage their reputation
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.320]   So I think that does have something to do with it. So people become afraid of expressing certain opinions
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.240]   But but
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.080]   Is it I mean, I don't think that it's going to change
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.960]   I think we're sort of we are seeing a bit of a when you know, some people call it the vibe shift
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.880]   It's slowly changing people are speaking more openly and criticizing cancel culture more
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.980]   But I think part of the reason why it's dying is because a lot of people have already been canceled
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   Well, it's also exhausting, you know, it's like really we're we're going to attack another person because their beliefs are slightly different
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.720]   And I think it's one of the things we've tried to do on the on the podcast is say hey
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.040]   Let's just have a conversation about these issues
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:17.000]   And be thoughtful about it and we don't hurt anybody's feelings
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.520]   But we do need to talk about some of these things in an intellectually honest way whether it's homeless whether it's black lives matter
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:31.920]   January 6 whatever we try to have an intellectually rigorous open-minded discussion and it feels to me like that has started to tip over
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.700]   I I see it very distinctly that
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:40.120]   You can only you know be canceled for your opinion if you allow them to cancel you
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:46.440]   Momentum is such that you try something for long enough when it eventually doesn't work. You try something else
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.820]   I think society has a resilient way of just doing that
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:55.280]   And so maybe people are realizing that cancel culture will not solve the problems that they care about
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.400]   I think it's well said and there has to be a different way Robin in the developed world
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.580]   Does the rise of luxury beliefs?
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.360]   Give rise to the populist movements
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.480]   I remember I would travel in the Midwest a lot. I work with farmers and rural communities
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.000]   I would go out to these rural communities. I meet with farmers and there was always ridicule about how Californians were arguing about
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.800]   the gender sign on bathrooms when their local conversation was can I make money this year and
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.760]   I hate being dependent on the government and I would hear this everywhere
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.160]   I would go in rural communities in the US and I was like Donald Trump's gonna win
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.900]   I mean, he's just he is the voice of this group
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:43.460]   But it seemed to me that that is what really triggered the sentiment for populism
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.460]   It's not just about not having enough money
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.040]   but it's about seeing the inanity in some the view the perceived inanity of
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.200]   these luxury beliefs
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.040]   From a group that that isn't afforded that luxury. Yeah
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.880]   Well, I think a lot of working-class people can sense that you know
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.700]   Many many members of that elite segment of society don't really have their best interests in mind
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.000]   They can see sort of it's it's not even just they don't share your values
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.120]   They're sort of intentionally promoting values that could undermine your communities and there's the kind of
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   disdain and so
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.560]   Yeah, just briefly returning. I think even even social media may actually be contributing to some extent
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.240]   I mean now people can go online and just see how
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:33.000]   Yeah, how mentally limited a lot of elites are just by looking at their Twitter profiles or the things that they say things that they
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   write about whatever
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.240]   Expressions that they have online and I think this is also sort of, you know
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.120]   It's sort of behind the curtain moment of wow, exactly. This is like that. This is who's leading the country
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.380]   This is or this is who who leads the most prestigious institutions
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.440]   And so yeah, I think there is a there's a bit of that as well. Can you talk about a little bit?
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.280]   Just back to family and marriage for a second. You wrote something about
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:03.080]   You know large numbers of sexual partners a sort of dating culture the hookup culture
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:08.420]   Can you just tie those two things together and one observation that I had and maybe it was because I read your stuff
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.120]   I then noticed that there seems to be these small green shoots of people who are being celebrated from getting married quite early now
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.480]   They tend to be stars
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   But there is this interesting trend
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.280]   and I thought wow this could be one of these things where you're now starting to model a
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.680]   Very different set of choices when you're 23 and 24 word, you know
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:33.800]   Nobody would have thought today you would get married and this obsession with matchmaking and maybe a better way than swiping
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.980]   Right would be to be thoughtful about the values your partner has
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   Yeah, I think there is an element of status here. I mean when tinder and a lot of the dating apps took off in around 2012
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.960]   In 2012 most Americans didn't have have cell phones yet or smartphones rather
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.120]   But then now that everyone has a smartphone and now that everyone's on the dating apps
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.960]   It has lost a bit of that
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   exclusivity a lot of that sort of signifier of
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.560]   Status and I think this is one reason why we're seeing a lot of a lot of affluent people sort of shift back to trying
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.800]   to meet online
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.480]   Or rather in person to meet in person
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   And yeah, I think
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.840]   Promiscuity all of these things. I had a friend a couple of years ago
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.840]   Who you know, he told me, you know Rob when I so so he was a student at an elite university
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.040]   And he said when I set my dating app radius to one mile just right out right around the University
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:30.560]   Most of the female profiles he saw these were fellow students and he said something like a third of them in the bios
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.280]   They said, you know, I'm you know poly or casual or not looking for anything serious and then when he extended the radius
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.880]   To the outskirts of the university, which is a more sort of blue-collar area same age range, you know
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.640]   Whatever, you know, it was a 20 to 24 year old women or something
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.880]   He said that the majority of the women he saw were single moms
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:53.920]   And so sexual promiscuity looks very different depending on your social class how much money you come from and so on
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:00.840]   Okay, we need to wrap you can follow Rob Henderson on Twitter and
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   and sign up for his sub stack
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   sub stack, yeah
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   Well done Rob
