[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   this is the issue of lock-in that I talk about at length in What We Are The Future,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   is that you get these moments of plasticity, the formation of a new institution, whether that's the
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.880]   you know, Christian church or the constitution of the United States,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.920]   and that like locks in a certain set of norms and that can be really good. If the set of norms and
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.880]   laws are good, like I think the kind of US constitution, I don't know, looking back it
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.680]   seems kind of miraculous or something. It was the first democratic constitution, as I understand it,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.440]   was like created over the period of four months. It really seems to have stood the test of time.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.680]   Or alternatively, it could be like extremely dangerous. I mean, we'll stick with the US
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.880]   constitution. There were horrible things in there and it was the like legal right to slavery was
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.560]   proposed as like a constitutional amendment. If that had gone in, that would have been like a
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.880]   horrible, a horrible kind of piece of lock-in.
