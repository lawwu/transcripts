[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   You can look up our $30 million grant to OpenAI, I think it was back in 2016.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Part of that grant was getting a board seat for Open Philanthropy for a few years that
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.940]   we could help with their governance at a crucial early time in their development.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.440]   I think some people believe that OpenAI has been net negative for the world because of
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.040]   the fact that they have contributed a lot to AI advancing and to AI being hyped.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.920]   And they think that gives us less time to prepare for it.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.640]   And I do think that all else equal, AI advancing faster gives us less time to prepare and is
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640]   a bad thing.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.120]   I don't think it's the only consideration.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.120]   I think OpenAI has done a number of good things too, has set some important precedents.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.200]   I think it's probably much more interested in a lot of the issues I'm talking about and
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.040]   risks from advanced AI than the company that I would guess would exist if they didn't that
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.280]   would be doing similar things.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   I don't really accept that even the idea that OpenAI is a negative force.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.920]   I think it's highly debatable.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.040]   If you look at our specific grant, that's even a completely different thing because
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440]   a lot of that was not just about boosting them, but was about getting to be part of
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.040]   of their early decision making.
