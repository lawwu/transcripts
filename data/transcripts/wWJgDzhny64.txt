[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   (applause)
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.180]   Take your seats, get comfy.
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.420]   I am so happy to introduce the McIntyre family to you today.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.360]   Many of you were at the 2022 conference
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.520]   where we had Michelle "Single Terry" McIntyre with us,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.960]   and that was the one that we did in the Chicago area.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.100]   And we knew she would be great,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.300]   but I don't think-- I had not expected how great she would be.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.800]   I was literally doubled over laughing
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.140]   at certain points in time.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.240]   I was crying real tears at other points in time.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.980]   And when we knew we were doing this conference
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580]   in the D.C. area, I reached out to Michelle and said,
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.580]   "Hey, would you be interested in joining us again?"
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.420]   And she said, "Well, yeah, I'd love to do it."
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420]   And she said, "I'd love to bring my family
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.720]   "and we can talk about our financial affairs a little bit
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   "and talk about how we've found harmony
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.260]   "around financial matters,
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.000]   "because those of us who are married and have families
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.400]   "know that it's a process."
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.600]   So that's what they're gonna talk about today.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.480]   Michelle is here in the striped jacket,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.780]   and many of you know Michelle "Single Terry,"
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780]   but I'll introduce her just in case.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.680]   She's the longtime Washington Post financial columnist.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.160]   She's nationally syndicated.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.620]   We ran into someone yesterday
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.720]   who said that she is his go-to resource wherever he lives,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   I think somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.860]   So she's everywhere.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460]   She's the author of numerous valuable books,
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.240]   and she's also won some of the biggest awards
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.540]   in journalism for her work at the Post.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.180]   So in 2021, she won the Gerald Loeb Award for Commentary,
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.080]   and then in 2022, she won what is widely considered
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.120]   the biggest award you can win as a journalist,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.980]   the Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.060]   So we are really thrilled to have Michelle here.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.160]   Her husband Kevin is here, and we know Kevin less well,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.620]   but we're very happy that he has volunteered his time
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.620]   to be with us.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.960]   Kevin, I'm hoping you can share
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.400]   a little bit about your personal story.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.700]   It sounds like you've recently retired,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.040]   so maybe you can talk about that,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.940]   and then we'll hear from daughter Monique, who is 28,
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.000]   and daughter Jillian, who's 23.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.780]   But let's start with you, Kevin.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.740]   - Great.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.580]   Good afternoon, everyone.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.400]   Good evening.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.420]   I'm Kevin McIntyre.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.320]   I am, let's see, I'm 62 years old.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.340]   I am a former federal employee.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.580]   I've recently retired at the end of June of this year,
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.300]   after 30-plus years in the Commerce Department
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.920]   and the Treasury Department, which is unusual
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.000]   because my degree is in mechanical engineering,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   so how I ended up there is a long story.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.540]   And so, like I said, I've just recently retired,
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.500]   and a lot of, if you've been reading Michelle's columns,
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.000]   there's a little bit in there about me
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.240]   and that journey and the stage that we're in right now
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   in terms of making decisions
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.980]   to set ourselves up for the future.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.580]   So we'll probably get into that a little bit.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.680]   - Sounds good.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.620]   So, Olivia, maybe you can go next.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.960]   - Hi, I'm Olivia.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.120]   Like she said, I'm 28.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.260]   So right now, I'm working at a group practice
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.500]   in College Park, Maryland, as a mental health therapist.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.000]   I graduated undergrad in 2013,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and then I went and got my, or no, sorry, in 2017,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.740]   and then I got my master's in 2019,
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.740]   and then I spent a year in Texas
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.040]   working and living with foster children,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.780]   and then I came back and started at the practice
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.180]   that I'm at, and then I just, this past August,
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.160]   passed my license exam and have my independent license,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.220]   so I'm very excited about that, thank you.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.800]   So now I'm kind of looking into what I wanna do next
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.000]   with that license, so.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.700]   - Hello, hi, I'm Jillian.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.000]   I graduated from Towson in 2022,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.240]   so last year with a degree in early childhood
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.080]   and special education.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.440]   I'm currently in my second year teaching kindergarten,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.720]   and then over the summer,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   I taught special needs three-year-olds.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.440]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.220]   Kevin, I'm gonna put you on the spot,
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.420]   but one of the things we were laughing so hard about
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.300]   last year was Michelle's thriftiness,
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.660]   which she described to us in great detail
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.400]   and made us all laugh.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.200]   So would you say you're on the same page with her
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.300]   with respect to thrift?
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.740]   - Hmm. (audience laughing)
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.880]   Ooh, starting off with the tough ones.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.020]   So we are of a similar mind.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.980]   She is probably more conservative than I am,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.460]   but I am also thrifty.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.060]   I mean, I think we both came from humble beginnings.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.560]   And so we both have a similar mindset about money.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.960]   We're both, we both live rather modestly
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.660]   or believe that that's how we should live,
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.300]   and so we live below our means.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.340]   We both are good savers and investors,
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.080]   and so, and in terms of the kids,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.820]   I think we do agree in terms of what we,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.320]   how we would like to talk with them
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.520]   about their financial futures and that sort of thing,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.220]   what we explain to them about our situation.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.660]   So yeah, I'd say we're pretty much in sync,
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.960]   not in lockstep, but in sync.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.700]   - Can you discuss, have there been any areas
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.940]   in recent memory where there was a little bit
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.240]   of a disconnect where one of you wanted to go one way
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.980]   and the other wanted to go another way?
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.180]   - From a financial standpoint?
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.020]   - Yeah.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.840]   - Okay.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.680]   How much time have we got?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.200]   Well, the thing that comes to mind
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.860]   most immediately is my retirement.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.160]   So I actually retired in June,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.200]   and it was a little bit sooner than I was planning to.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.800]   I was planning to retire probably at the end of the year,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.540]   but there was a difficult situation.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.100]   I was in at work, and it was to the point
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.440]   where I had to do something, either change or retire.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.980]   And I didn't really want to, at this stage of my career,
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.220]   start over into something else.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.620]   And so we talked about retirement.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.680]   So we went back and forth about,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.280]   can you hang on to the end of the year?
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.460]   And so it was a good conversation
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.560]   to have leading up to my retirement,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.740]   and it's one that we've even continued going forward
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.160]   because it brought to the surface a lot of things
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.800]   that we have to think about
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.980]   for our long-term future in retirement.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.780]   So one of the decisions that we made along the way
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.420]   was that we paid off our mortgage,
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.320]   because we agreed early on
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.940]   that we were not gonna retire with a mortgage.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.620]   And there's been some discussion around that.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.920]   We had a good discussion the other night at dinner,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.880]   last night at dinner, about it.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.360]   But that was a decision that we made personally.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.500]   But even as we agreed on that,
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.160]   there were other things that we didn't agree on
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.040]   in terms of, can I afford to leave yet?
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.900]   Should I hang on to the end of the year,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.940]   even after we paid off the mortgage?
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.080]   Should I hang on and then take the mortgage payments
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.700]   and put that into a savings account
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.140]   so we have a little bit of cushion by the time I retire?
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.680]   And obviously, I retired sooner than that.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.920]   (laughs)
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.020]   So yeah, that was probably the most recent thing
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.860]   where we had a little bit of intense discussion.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.780]   - Yeah, so I wanted to ask about that.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.500]   And Michelle and I talked about this separately,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.100]   this idea of when you retire,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.560]   if you've been a saver your whole life,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   your whole career, transitioning into spending mode
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.340]   or having to tap that portfolio, it feels bad.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.340]   So Michelle, maybe you can talk about
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.080]   kind of making peace with that,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.020]   which we all must do eventually.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.740]   We're gonna have to, that was the point, right?
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.860]   That we saved to retire at some point.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.120]   So talk about that. - In theory, yeah, in theory.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.820]   I love the last panel was Mike said, "Get therapy."
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.360]   Yes, I'm getting therapy.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.100]   (audience laughs)
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.060]   Kevin was actually kind, because for those of you here,
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.900]   last year I talked about how I grew up.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.080]   And so I grew up with my grandmother who was very frugal.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.640]   And I've always had this fear
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.600]   that I'm not gonna have enough.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.920]   And so I actually did write a column
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.080]   about my husband's gonna retire
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.840]   and I'm scared we're gonna run out of money
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.520]   and we're not gonna run out of money.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   But it's so hard when you spend your entire life,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   your entire existence saving, saving, saving,
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.880]   denying, denying, denying.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.480]   They can tell you some things.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.920]   And then all of a sudden people are like,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.120]   "Well, you can spend."
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   And that's actually where we had the most intense fellowship
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.240]   because he wants to spend the money.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.880]   (audience laughs)
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.080]   I don't wanna spend.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.960]   And so he wants to buy something and I'm like, "What, no."
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.160]   And he'll put something in the Amazon box
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.140]   and I'll take it out of the Amazon box.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.480]   (audience laughs)
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.880]   And so he says, "Well, honey,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.240]   "we spent all this time saving this.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.960]   "Let's enjoy it, 'cause we don't wanna leave it to."
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.800]   (audience laughs)
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.840]   'Cause he said, "If we don't enjoy it,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.400]   "they're gonna enjoy it."
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.880]   And so I can't get there.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.520]   And I'm not gonna lie, I'm not there yet.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.320]   And the only way he is allowed to put stuff
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.760]   back into the Amazon box is he'll say,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   we have phrases that we say in our marriage
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.920]   to help us not fuss and cuss.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.600]   And so he'll say, "Well, let's go to the net worth statement."
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.920]   I hate that.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.880]   (audience laughs)
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.800]   Because a personal net worth statement,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.060]   all the assets and all the liabilities,
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.640]   and at the bottom half, it's zero, zero, zero,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.120]   zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.140]   And then the net worth, which is,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.720]   shh, don't tell him, is considerable.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.000]   And so he'll say, "Look at that."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.780]   And I just get mad, because then I have to let him
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.400]   put something back in the Amazon box.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.680]   (audience laughs)
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   But it's very difficult.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.480]   And I think Mike was right.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.920]   I think those of us who are the aunt,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.760]   and that example of the aunt and the grasshopper,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.840]   we do have to come to the point where it's okay
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.280]   to spend some of it and live a life
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.520]   that you've spent your whole life trying to do.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.080]   And what I loved about this conference this whole weekend
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.300]   is strategies to do that, to make yourself more comfortable.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.240]   And I have to say that you really have relieved me.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.920]   You've helped me this weekend.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.900]   I'm not saying he could buy everything in the Amazon box,
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.640]   but a couple of more things, because we have a good plan.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.140]   - So Michelle, like in addition to getting therapy
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.160]   or something, what strategies will you use
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.200]   to help you over this hurdle when you eventually retire
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.280]   and your income stops altogether?
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.760]   - Ooh, see that right there?
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.240]   (audience laughs)
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.860]   My heart started palpitating.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:22.200]   So I think the whole weekend was like plan, plan, plan.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   And so we started retirement planning like 20 years ago,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.380]   and I'm not exaggerating.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.060]   So one of the big things was to pay the house off.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.220]   And I wrote a column about that, and oh my gosh,
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.940]   people lost their everlasting mind.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.500]   Because we used some funds, we did a mortgage recast,
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.340]   we made extra mortgage payments.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.740]   For the entire time we had a mortgage,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.700]   we had, now some of you will probably cringe,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.500]   we had like a 2.75% mortgage, and people were like,
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.040]   "How could you give that cheap money?"
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.280]   And I was like, "Mind your business."
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.040]   (audience laughs)
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.560]   So that was one thing to pay off the mortgage.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.440]   I like pots.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.820]   I'm a pot person, not that kind of pot.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.360]   (audience laughs)
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.760]   Pots, plural.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.560]   So we have a travel fund, we've set them up,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.320]   we saved enough that none of them have education debt.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   They actually even have money to go to grad school.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.920]   So we made sure that was okay.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.240]   We have a cash fund.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.600]   So we have set things to the point
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.080]   where we know how to pull stuff out.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.920]   And so now the next thing
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.360]   is to do some more tax management, things like that.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.320]   So we made sure we keep our expenses in check.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   And we just made sure that the groundwork was there
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.480]   to allow us to spend.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   Now I just gotta get the mental thing together.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.480]   And I'm not, I'm just not gonna lie.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.600]   I'm just not there yet.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.080]   He is.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.000]   So I don't know.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.080]   (laughs)
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.680]   - So Olivia and Jillian, I wanna bring you into this.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.080]   Michelle said that when you were growing up,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.480]   there was a lot of like, no, we are saving for,
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.160]   I want you to graduate college debt-free.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.940]   Can you talk about sort of that?
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.180]   Like you wanted this and your mom and dad
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.780]   were sort of telling you that you needed
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.640]   to delay that gratification into the future.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.480]   (laughs)
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.960]   - Yeah, there's lots of stories.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.500]   I actually, I don't know what age I was,
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.980]   but for Christmas or your birthday or something,
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.340]   we made like a booklet of all the like sayings
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.320]   that she would say to us like over and over again.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.280]   Like, is it a need or a want?
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.840]   Do you have McDonald's money?
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.040]   Like, it's a lot of, you know, college fund, college fund.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.120]   Like, do you can't have that
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.240]   'cause we're paying for your college fund.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.160]   Like it was like a lot of stuff
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.000]   whenever we would ask for things
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.700]   or just lots of money conversations.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.560]   It was pretty intense.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.400]   (laughs)
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.240]   I'm not gonna lie.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.800]   It was pretty intense.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.880]   It was quite a lot of like money conversations
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.720]   and a lot of, like she was saying,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.360]   like a lot of denying, you know,
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.800]   like we would get things after it was like not cool
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.700]   to have them anymore and they were like on sale
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.560]   or nobody cared about having that thing anymore.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.240]   Then we got it and it was like, well, thank you.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.140]   And also like, this is maybe three years behind
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.200]   like what everyone else is doing.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.120]   So then we just kind of learned to stop
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.440]   like paying attention or caring, you know,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.720]   about what people were having.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.160]   'Cause we were like, well, we're just not gonna get it.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.920]   So you kind of have to like self-soothe
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.720]   and say that it's fine, you know.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.400]   We'll focus on other things, I guess.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   - Yeah, I think that I remember
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.240]   a lot of the rules the most.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.280]   Like, I first remember I asked for like
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.840]   some really elaborate payment
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.280]   and she got me one that had like a saving,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.240]   a spending, an investing, a charity, little spots in them.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.840]   So of course I put all of the ones in the savings.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.880]   What a 10 year old has to invest, I don't know.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.720]   But you know, then I was like,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.520]   if you went to the grocery store
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.880]   and I picked something up and I didn't know the price of it,
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.160]   what it was, I automatically had to put it back.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.480]   So when you started, you had to remember the price
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.840]   and be like, let me get this, this is 3.25,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.320]   I promise I'll open it up.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.960]   And then sort of like that kind of stuff, yeah.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.800]   - What was sort of the light bulb moment for you?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.320]   Like, oh, here's why we're doing this.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.400]   Like, when did you feel like
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.300]   you really got the method to the madness?
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.180]   - Ooh, it was late, I would say.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:29.440]   I would probably say after graduating college
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.260]   or maybe sometime in college
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.000]   and hearing people talk about kind of the loans
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.200]   and being stressed out about, you know, repayments
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.680]   and being able to graduate and not have to worry about that,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.960]   it really started to click for me
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.680]   and I could make different decisions
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   than my friends were making.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.160]   And I was like, oh, okay, this has a really big impact.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.040]   And especially when I went and got my master's
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.200]   and that was also debt-free,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.160]   like that was like a huge game changer
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160]   'cause I was talking to people in my program
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.600]   who had undergrad debt and then also had master's debt.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   And I went into social work,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.080]   which depending on what you do
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.040]   is not like a super high paying career.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.600]   And so a lot of the people in the program
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.920]   were talking about that and kind of the stress of that
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.400]   and saying like, well, I have this passion to serve
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   and I have to go to school and get all of this debt
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.700]   and then my earning potential when I graduate,
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.620]   it's a really stressful circumstance for them.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.440]   And I just felt so like grateful
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.920]   that I didn't have to worry about that.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.480]   And I think that's when it really started to click like,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.000]   oh, okay, maybe, you know,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.120]   like all of the silent like resentment,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.960]   like, you know, not having the things
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.280]   like it actually really mattered
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.760]   and like all of that stuff is kind of irrelevant now
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.080]   because I'm in a position to have so much more flexibility
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.160]   and freedom than a lot of my peers.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.120]   - Yeah, I would say mine was my experience was similar.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.880]   Like I think maybe after my first year in college,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.120]   just talking to my peers and like realizing like how much
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   like they actually had to take out already
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.480]   just in the first year.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.700]   And that was actually when I started thinking like,
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.360]   oh, what about my master's degree?
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.400]   So I started applying to scholarships
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.640]   and then I got full ride in my last three years of school
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.560]   and I was like, okay, now I can have my master's degree.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.320]   So it really just made it like,
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.400]   I was just thinking much more ahead
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.800]   just because of like the foundation that we had.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.280]   - Yeah, so Kevin and Michelle,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.880]   I wanna back up and talk about how it was such a pride,
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.680]   why it was such a priority for you
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.560]   to not have your kids emerge from college
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.120]   with a bunch of debt.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.720]   - Yeah, I will have to say we're,
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.640]   I don't wanna say 'cause we're with our people.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.840]   So y'all acquired too.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.640]   So, but out there, the abnormal people,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.040]   they'll say things like,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.920]   well, I'm not gonna pay for them to go to college
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.980]   'cause they have to learn how to do it on their own
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.400]   or those kinds of things.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.920]   But my husband and I have to say
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.220]   from the beginning of our marriage,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.640]   we're very intentional about a lot of things,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.080]   paying off our mortgage, living below our means
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.160]   and making sure our kids had the choices
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.800]   when they graduated from college.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.760]   We didn't know obviously what they wanted to do for a living
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   but we wanted them to operate in their God-given gift.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.840]   And that meant we did not push them
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.080]   into one career or another.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.360]   You know, lots of parents, you gotta be a doctor,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.200]   gotta be a lawyer, you gotta be this, gotta be that,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.560]   you know, or your kid is in sports,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.920]   you gotta play all these sports
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.000]   'cause you gotta get a scholarship,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.240]   you gotta get in the NFL.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.400]   And there's so much pressure on that.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.640]   And so we wanted them whatever it was
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.160]   that they wanted to do.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.480]   And I think it's a blessing that that one is a teacher,
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.240]   that she was born to be a teacher.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   This one, she tries to tell me what to do.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.280]   She is born to be a therapist.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.640]   And with the mother she had, she needed to do that, right?
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.840]   And my son, our son is on the autism spectrum.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.640]   And so we didn't of course know that when he was born
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.200]   but because we were so frugal,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.320]   we had the money to be able to help him as well.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.600]   And so we wanted them to have the freedom
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.720]   to do what they wanted to do.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.640]   So this one, they're all living with us by choice.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.240]   Well, okay, I did kind of force them, we forced them
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.840]   so that they could save money.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.280]   But you know, she now,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.880]   she's gonna transition to another job.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.040]   So she's gonna take two months to travel.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.120]   She's gonna go to Australia, New Zealand.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.480]   She wouldn't be able to do that if she had a lot of debt.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.240]   This is a time that she can do this.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.000]   And this one, her job is so stressful.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.080]   Being a teacher is so stressful.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.440]   It is one of the most amazing careers.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.080]   And now she can do that and not have all the stress
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.680]   of money and we really wanted that for them.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.400]   That was our gift to them.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.360]   And so that's why we did that.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.600]   We wanted them to be able to not have that.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   In order to do that, they had a,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.040]   hey, it was not an easy childhood
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.840]   'cause they, like she said, they didn't get a lot of stuff.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.200]   And we put a lock on our door with a deadbolt
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.800]   so they don't smother us in our sleep.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.240]   You know, you can imagine it was not easy living with us
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.200]   to say no all the time because we have a culture of yes.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.080]   And we have a culture of raising entitled children.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.280]   And a lot of people in our position, in your position,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.040]   maybe not your adult children,
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.320]   are not very good with money
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.600]   because they were given everything.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.120]   And I think my husband and I can say,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.800]   these kids are so good money managers
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.200]   and they know how to save.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.360]   But I'm so glad they're here at this conference
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.800]   because the next step is to get them to be as enthusiastic
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.280]   about investing as they are about saving.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.320]   And so I'm thanking y'all, talk to them,
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.160]   especially that one on the end.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.560]   'Cause she still, get this,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.480]   she still hasn't signed up for her World 3B plan.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   So can y'all like, yes, right, right.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.840]   Get her, get her.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.080]   She's gonna do it, but we, you know,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.320]   she's looking through the offerings,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.600]   but y'all still get her.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.120]   But so that's why, you know,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.440]   I mean, you know, we don't come from money.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.280]   None of our families has a lot of money
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   and we wanted our wealth to be worth something for them.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.400]   And so, you know, like they will never have a car note.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.960]   They don't know what it's like to have debt.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.480]   This one is still driving the car that we gave her
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.840]   when she was 16 years old.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.400]   She's 28 and she's gonna, her next car,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.120]   she's saving up in a Vanguard non-retirement account
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.440]   to pay cash for it.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.800]   That's amazing.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:07.000]   - So I just wanna mention Rick Ferry is walking around,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.040]   looks like he's collecting questions
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.440]   for the McIntyre family, which we will take.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   But I just wanna ask Olivia about your savings habits.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.440]   Sounds like you're in really good shape,
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.920]   that you're a discipline saver
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.720]   and probably doing that not on a high salary.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.100]   So let's talk about your tricks of the trade there.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.520]   What are you doing?
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.560]   - I mean, I'm just kind of doing what I was raised to do.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.280]   It's actually, it's gotten to the point
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.960]   where now she's trying to convince me
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.320]   to spend money on things.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.280]   Like if I wanna go on a trip, like for, you know,
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.640]   my birthday and I was like, oh, like maybe we'll go here.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.960]   And they're like, no, like you can go and get the massage.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.400]   And I'm like, but the massage is like a hundred dollars.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.640]   Like, I don't know.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.540]   So I think it's just a lot of the, you know,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.800]   like a lot of the no's that I heard in childhood
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.200]   are now like my own voice.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.140]   Like I'm walking around, I'm like, no,
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.480]   you don't really need that.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.520]   Or like, it's fine.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   Like, you know, like don't go out to eat.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.840]   Like there's stuff in the fridge that you can eat.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.760]   And so I think it's just a lot of those little choices.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.800]   And then also I've like figured out what it is
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.900]   that is like really important to me to spend on.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.760]   And so I really do enjoy, like she mentioned,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.800]   I enjoy traveling a lot.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.560]   And so, you know, traveling is really expensive.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.040]   And as I get older, I'm less inclined
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.560]   to like stay in sketchier places.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.520]   And so I want to stay in nicer places now.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.160]   And so I need to, you know, make sacrifices in other areas
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.960]   in order to spend on the things
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.520]   that are really important to me.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.960]   And so a lot of those no's are just kind of ingrained
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.520]   in my head now.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.600]   And so it's not like anything extravagant.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.520]   I just kind of live on less, I guess,
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.840]   'cause that's how I was raised.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.680]   What?
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.960]   How stressed out I am about it?
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.080]   Yes, it's very stressful.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   So I guess two, maybe two years ago,
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.640]   I was talking to my dad and I was like,
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.080]   okay, I have like a relatively large,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.640]   like lump sum of money that I have saved.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.520]   And I was like, oh, like what kind of like savings account
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.360]   should I put it in?
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.680]   Like some of them, like you get like a higher investment
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.520]   or whatever.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.800]   And he was like, well, they're all going to be
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.640]   like really little.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.760]   You know, like what you really should do is put it in
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.960]   like a Vanguard account that we have.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.800]   And I was like, okay.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.600]   So, I mean, I, you know, to a certain extent,
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   I trust their judgment.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.280]   And so I was like, okay, like, what are you doing?
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.960]   You know, like tell me what it is that you're doing.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.000]   And so he was like, okay, this is what we're doing.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.600]   And he was like, okay, these are the, you know,
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.040]   the funds that you can put the money in.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.360]   And I was like, okay.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.680]   And so I did it.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.560]   And then shortly thereafter, I just started losing money.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.920]   And I have been maybe like in the positive for like two
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.880]   weeks over like the two and a half years, I guess.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.440]   And I hate it.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   Like, it's really, I hate it a lot.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   And they keep, every time I go and I'm like, see,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.480]   like, it's like, I'm losing money.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.120]   Like if I had just put it in a savings account,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.520]   like I would still have all of my money.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.360]   And they're like, no, this is the best time.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   Like put more money in.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.480]   I'm like, this is a scam.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.200]   They're scamming me.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.320]   Like, I feel like I'm getting robbed.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.200]   Like they had me set up automatic payments.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.920]   So like every month Vanguard like robs my bank account.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.560]   And then they just like, it's really stressful.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.400]   And they're like, no, no, no.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.480]   Like put more in.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.560]   I'm like, this is like a snake oil, like salesman pitch.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.680]   Like when things are bad,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.520]   that's the best time to put more money in.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.680]   Like what kind of logic is that?
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.360]   It's so backwards.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.240]   But because I trust them and like my mom was saying,
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.440]   like my dad is like the calm one.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.840]   Like he's a little more like even keeled.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.720]   And so he's like, no, like it's gonna be fine.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.960]   Like, just stop looking at it.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.080]   Just stop looking at it.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.760]   Like you can stop showing us, we know.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.280]   And so, because I trust them, I'm like, okay,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.480]   I'm not gonna move it.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.360]   Like I'm gonna leave it alone.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.840]   And then being here and like listening to the talks
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.320]   and going to the dinner, I'm like, okay,
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.520]   well there's more people who are bought into this.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.840]   And so I'm like, okay, maybe it's okay.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.400]   Like maybe it's not just them.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   Like there's some other really smart people here
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.360]   who are also doing the same thing.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.160]   So I'm like, all right, it should be fine.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.360]   And then, you know, my dad like showed me
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.000]   kind of the graphs like over time.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.600]   'Cause one of the things I wanna do is retire early.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.920]   And so he was kind of putting it in into the projections.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   And I was like, oh, that looks really nice.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.840]   Like, you know, like, 'cause there's like a calculator
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.280]   that you can do and like depending on how much you put in,
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.880]   you can retire at a certain time.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.240]   And so after we did that graph, I was like,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.320]   okay, let's put a lot in.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.640]   Like, you know, like let's put as much
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.840]   as we possibly can in.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.880]   'Cause I do wanna retire early so I can travel a lot more.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.400]   So even though it's like really painful for me emotionally,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.680]   like they've been like really good support,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.880]   emotional support systems of like,
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.280]   just leave the money where it is.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.560]   And so I'm hoping that they're right.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.840]   And when I get older, I will be very happy.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.240]   I'm not happy now, but I trust them
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.720]   that I will be happy later.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.680]   And if I'm not, I'm coming for all of you.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.640]   (laughing)
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.400]   So that is where I am in my investment journey.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.840]   - So Jillian, how about you?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.480]   It sounds like you are, have some reservations too
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.600]   and you can contribute to a 403(b)
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.240]   but haven't done so yet.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.200]   Is Olivia's attitude rubbing off on you
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.960]   or what's your hesitation?
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.120]   - Yes, I think I was more of the notorious one
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.800]   for like dragging my feet.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.560]   I think that I was reflecting on it this weekend
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.800]   in the past couple of months.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.640]   I think part of it is my perspective of like
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.400]   my future goals and my perspective of time.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.040]   Like if somebody asked me, what are your long-term goals?
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.000]   I would say, oh, well, two years from now,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.600]   five years from now, I'm gonna be,
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.760]   and I think of that as long-term
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.400]   because if you think of that, that's a quarter of my life.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.520]   So I had to shift my perspective
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.360]   from thinking of like five years from now
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.200]   as like a short term goal.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   I would like my retirement as being a long-term goal
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.040]   'cause there's things that I wanna do now.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.800]   And then I think kind of, again,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.680]   realizing what it is important to me
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.480]   and what I'm gonna wanna be able to do.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.200]   And it's mostly in the lean,
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.760]   but my parents have been traveling so much
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   since they retired, so I would like to be able to do that.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.280]   So just watching my dad enjoy the fruits of all of it
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.960]   has kind of like influenced me
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.880]   into like making the decision to invest.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.040]   - What are your, you have like shorter term financial goals
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:27.880]   as we all do.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.800]   What are the things that you wanna achieve
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.400]   well before retirement?
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.360]   - Yeah, so I would like to move out.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.860]   Love them, but I would like to move out.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.480]   You know, and I would like to maybe not rent
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.200]   and just buy outright.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.520]   And then just be able to support myself like independently
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.360]   and like have my own growth
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.520]   would be like my short-term goal right now.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:56.220]   - So Olivia mentioned that Kevin is really calm
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.080]   with respect to investments.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.760]   Are you two on the same page, Michelle,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.440]   and Kevin with respect to taking investment risk,
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.060]   or is one of you more nervous when the market is going down?
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:12.920]   - We are on the same page in terms of long-term investing
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.460]   and have been for a long time.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.680]   But in terms of investment risk,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.040]   I have a much higher risk tolerance than she does.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.880]   And that's probably reflected in our portfolio.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.080]   What she brings to the, I think we work well as a team.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.760]   What she brings to the table in terms of our investing
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.680]   is the discipline, the starting early,
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.800]   the maxing out on the 401(k),
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   maxing out on the TSP, being consistent over time.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.560]   And that's what she brought.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.840]   What I brought was, hey,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.560]   let's put the pedal to the metal and go.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.360]   Let's find those equity investments
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.040]   that are really gonna do well for us,
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   put it there and stop looking at it.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.280]   Now, I'm okay putting it someplace and not looking at it,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.600]   maybe periodically, six months, a year, whatever,
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.080]   considering that it's long-term.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.960]   And I'm thinking back now, 20 years or so
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.740]   when we first started this.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.240]   So she watches it much more frequently than I do.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.980]   She watches it probably, I don't know what, monthly or?
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.440]   So. (laughing)
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.480]   And yeah, let's go with that, okay.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.200]   And so she watches it and she sees it go up and down
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.360]   and up and down, and it does take a toll
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.120]   on her mental, on her peace.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   And I say, look, set it aside, don't worry about it,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.080]   we don't need it right now.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.560]   Look, it's down 5%, particularly during 2008.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.920]   Oh my goodness, that was really.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.480]   But I think one thing that we did
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.960]   that I'm proud of that we did was we left it alone.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.800]   We didn't move anything.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.280]   I have friends in the federal government,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.880]   we all, TSP, we would talk about
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.560]   what we're doing with our accounts.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.600]   And many of them got out at the bottom,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.760]   and they never recovered those losses.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.520]   And so I'm really glad that we stayed in,
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.040]   market recovered and then some.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.400]   So I think, but that was a very stressful time
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.280]   looking at those, we lost probably 30 or 35%
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.480]   of our portfolio value at that time.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.840]   - Yeah, Kevin, I wanted to ask, you mentioned TSP,
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.400]   and I would imagine there are some
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.360]   federal government employees here with us.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.160]   And a question is like, TSP, I think we would agree
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   is through a savings plan is really a stellar plan
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.560]   in so many respects.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.640]   Is it something that you think you will continue
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.720]   to hang on to through retirement?
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.840]   Or what's your plan there?
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.800]   - Yeah, at this point, I don't have any plans
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.920]   to move the money out of TSP.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.440]   I think that because TSP has some of the lowest fees,
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.520]   some of the lowest expenses associated with it,
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.680]   and there were some changes made recently
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.640]   that improved some of the flexibilities
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.320]   in terms of when you can take withdrawals
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.400]   and that sort of thing.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.960]   So right now, it suits our needs.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.760]   We don't have a need right now to go in
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.040]   and start pulling any of it out
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.600]   because Michelle's still working.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.960]   And I get a small federal pension.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.120]   And at some point, we're gonna start
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.400]   taking Social Security, that's been part of,
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.000]   what's interesting about this weekend
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.560]   is there's been a fair amount of discussion
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.960]   about when is the right time to take Social Security.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.560]   I'm inclined to take it sooner.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.600]   Michelle's inclined to wait until 70 to take it.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.320]   And so we're probably gonna compromise
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.960]   in there somewhere in the middle.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.320]   But yeah, I think that's, so far,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.360]   I think as far as TSP's concerned,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.240]   I'm gonna hang on to it.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.160]   - So we've been getting questions.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.800]   Here's one for Michelle, which is,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   can you summarize the most important financial lessons
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.280]   you learned from Big Mama
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.120]   that you passed on to your daughters?
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.160]   - Well, they can probably answer,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.760]   but I will, you wanna answer that?
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.600]   No?
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.000]   - Say who Big Mama is for people who don't know.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.080]   - I went to go live with my grandmother when I was four.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.320]   My oldest sister was eight.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.680]   I had a sister who was three
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   and twin brothers who were just under two years old.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.480]   So we went to live with my grandmother.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.400]   And my grandfather was in the home, but not in the home.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.880]   He was an alcoholic.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.480]   So a lot of times his money didn't make it home.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.280]   And I don't know, I always tear up at this.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.800]   But this woman with an alcoholic husband,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.680]   five grandchildren,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.920]   a job where she didn't make very much money
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.400]   as a nursing assistant, was able to save.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.960]   And she paid off her house before she retired.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.160]   And she just was a masterful money manager.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.000]   And I think the one lesson that she taught me
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   that has just been the root of our wealth
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   is to save a percentage of every dollar
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.800]   that crosses your palm.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.880]   And I remember,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.040]   I don't know if I told you all this story last time,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.280]   but when my first week at the Baltimore Evening Sun
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   as a full-fledged reporter, I covered a major fire.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.840]   I got on the front page, that's a big deal in our business.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.560]   And I called my grandmother, who do you call first?
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.080]   And I said, Big Mama, oh my gosh, I'm on the front page
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.160]   and I'm trying to tell her.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.880]   And she said, "Did you go up to HR
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.080]   "and make sure they took money out of your paycheck
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.920]   "to put into a savings account?"
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.040]   Uh, no.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   And click up.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.520]   And I thought she dropped the phone.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.680]   So I called her back and I said, "Oh, the phone dropped."
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.240]   And so I started to tell her again.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.120]   I have front page, byline.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   And she said, "Did you go up to HR
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.200]   "and make sure you put money in a savings account?
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.960]   "You know, you split the deposit."
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.440]   I said, "Nah, I haven't gotten to that."
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.280]   Click up.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.360]   And so, because I knew my grandmother
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.120]   would never listen to me, I left that moment,
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   went up to HR, put money aside,
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.000]   went back, called her again.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.160]   She asked the same question, "Did you?"
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.600]   I said, "I sure did."
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.080]   And then she said, "Tell me about your day."
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.760]   And that was the beginning of making sure
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.240]   that every time I got a money from,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.240]   you know, we took, I got a buyout from the Evening Sun.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.960]   We took all of that money and put it down,
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.000]   paid for our house.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.240]   You know, every time I get anything, we put money aside.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.000]   We taught them to do that.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.240]   In fact, you know, they used to have an allowance.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.880]   They never got the money, 'cause we would make a point.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.360]   It's rude, right?
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.200]   I think.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.240]   Right?
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.920]   To say like, oh, you're getting whatever,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.920]   like $6 or whatever it is, like at a certain interval.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.800]   - It was your age.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.640]   - Oh, it was your age.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.480]   Okay, whatever.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.080]   So I was like, you know, okay, you're getting it.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.680]   And I'm like, okay, like, where is it?
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.640]   And they're like, oh, like it's in this account.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.880]   I'm like, how do I access the account?
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.800]   Like, oh, well, you know, we'll talk about it later.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.680]   Like, I'm just like, this is technically my money, right?
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.640]   And so like, I really actually never saw that money.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.280]   And then I was like, in college.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.520]   And I was like, oh, I need something.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.280]   And they're like, oh, your like allowance account.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.120]   You can.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.040]   I was like, oh, now I can like have the allowance account
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.000]   for my school.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.960]   I was like, okay.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.200]   Rude.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   - No, yeah, same thing.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.440]   I like never saw any of that money, for sure.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.240]   I think the biggest thing was just like realizing
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.720]   like the value of saving.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.920]   And again, like using that money for things
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.840]   that really matter to you later on.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.680]   Like I'm not, I don't miss like the McDonald's
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.520]   that I never got.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.960]   Or like this really important like pink Barbie toy
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.800]   when I was a kid.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   But I do still remember like all the really nice vacations
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.720]   we used to take and like all the Christmas stuff.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.400]   So the stuff that was really important,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.440]   I never missed out on.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.760]   So I just realized that like, you know,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   just save it until you have something
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.920]   that you really truly value that you want.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.880]   - Yeah, so I have a question for Olivia and Jillian
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.640]   that came in and you kind of just answered it,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.040]   but maybe you have a different answer.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.320]   What was the best or most relevant advice,
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.760]   financial, I would assume,
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.400]   or maybe anything that your parents have given you?
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:19.560]   - She's looking at me like you go first.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.320]   I mean, I guess what Jillian just said
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.920]   about figuring out what's really important
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.160]   to spend your money on.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.480]   'Cause I think for a while, like I didn't realize
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.080]   kind of like where we sat in terms of like middle class
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.160]   or like upper middle class, whatever.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.080]   Like I kind of assumed that we were like not poor,
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.600]   but I was like, oh, we just must not have money.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.360]   Like we must not have a lot.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.560]   And then people would be like,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.600]   you just said that you went on a two week vacation.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.560]   Like, what are you talking about?
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.960]   Like, your family must be well off.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.320]   And I was like, do you see my shoes?
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   Like, can you see like the pants that I'm wearing?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.080]   Like, I don't understand.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.440]   And then I guess the older I got, I started to realize like,
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.480]   oh, well that was, we went on these like
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.320]   really nice vacations or we had like a nice house,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.680]   even though we had a terrible car.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.640]   Like the purple van was like, it was really bad, guys.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.240]   It was actually really bad.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.320]   But like we would have the nice things
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.880]   'cause those were the things that were important to spend on.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.760]   Like I said, I still have my car.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.920]   Her name is Charlotte and I love her to death.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.040]   And I will have Charlotte until she like sadly dies on me.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.600]   And however long that is, is however long I'll have her.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.760]   Because I don't necessarily care about
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.040]   what kind of car I have.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.440]   People laugh 'cause they get in my car
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.760]   and it doesn't have a backup camera.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.880]   And people are like, what's going on?
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.200]   Like your car doesn't have a, like how do I,
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.280]   like how do I, you know, like back into the spot?
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.360]   Like you have to turn around.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.440]   Like it's not, like it's not that hard.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.400]   But you know, I will have Charlotte, you know, for forever.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.800]   But like Jillian said, I'm still living at home as well.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.120]   And one of the reasons I made that choice
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.400]   is because I also want to move out and not have to rent.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.080]   And so one of the things that the investment account
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.760]   that I have that is not doing so well right now
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   is for is so that I can put a down payment on a house.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   I don't have to move out and rent.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.120]   And so I think that lesson was really important
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.520]   in terms of save the money and then spend it
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.600]   on the things that really matter to you.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.640]   - Jillian, how about you?
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.480]   - Ditto.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.760]   Yeah, same thing.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.560]   Like the foundation of like that being debt-free
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.120]   and saving provides you to be able to like
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.440]   have more opportunities and do things you want
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.480]   is really important, would be like the biggest lesson.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.640]   - So question for Kevin and Michelle.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.320]   Were you comfortable sharing what you make
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.840]   with your children?
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.600]   If so, at what age?
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.000]   - I'm not telling them what we make, no.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   - That's actually, it's a good question.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.720]   So we did not share how much we made for them
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.640]   for a very long time.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.360]   First of all, it wasn't in their business.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.000]   And we didn't want them, I mean, in the beginning
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.840]   of our career, we weren't making that much.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.120]   But you know, now we make some good ducats.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.400]   And we did not want them to feel as if
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.200]   they could live a certain way because of what we earned.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.400]   So we actually wanted to keep them in the dark
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.440]   about our wealth.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.160]   And they don't, I mean, she will know soon
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.440]   the totality of it 'cause she's gonna run our estate.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.480]   Can I tell y'all something really quick?
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.000]   I know this is crazy.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.360]   So she's gonna be ahead of us.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.320]   We have a will, but now we're gonna update it
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.640]   now that she is 28.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.400]   And so we sat down at the table
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   and we have paid off our home.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.920]   And my desire was to have a house
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.280]   that someone could always live in
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.000]   and not have to pay rent, right?
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   And so there's three of them.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   So I said, well, all three of y'all could live here,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.400]   one of you.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.320]   And so this one, go ahead and tell me what you see.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.160]   Go ahead, go ahead.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.400]   - You want this one?
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.080]   - So she says, I say, you're not gonna ever sell this house.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.280]   You're just gonna use it for the,
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.200]   and so she said, no, we're gonna sell.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.040]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.400]   I said, you're not gonna sell my house.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.560]   She said, no, we're gonna sell.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.120]   And so they get along really well.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.480]   The siblings are really close.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.120]   And so she said, well, but mommy,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.840]   we grew up in this house, it's too big for us.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.560]   We really don't want it.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.720]   If one of us had it for free,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.480]   the other two of us might feel some kind of way about that.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.440]   And wouldn't it be better to sell it
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.560]   and divide the proceeds so that we each,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.080]   and because we live in this area,
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.960]   they really could almost buy a house
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.480]   with the value of our house now,
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.160]   'cause we've been in it for a long time.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.600]   And she just laid it out like that.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.080]   Like, that's what we're gonna do.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.320]   And I'm like, you're not gonna sell my house.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.120]   Because especially in our community as African-American,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.600]   home ownership is just such a prize.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.800]   And the idea that she wanted to sell this house
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.520]   that took us so long to pay off, it just hurt my heart.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.600]   But then I realized she was absolutely right.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.000]   They can make a different way.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.760]   That money can go a long way
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.200]   for them to be mortgage-free
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.440]   long before we were mortgage-free.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.880]   And it took me a while to understand
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.360]   that that was okay to let the house go.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.800]   So a lot of you all, and maybe not you, but others,
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.400]   they wanna keep this house that the kids don't want.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.920]   And so we said, okay, finally, it's okay.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.960]   So then I said, well, okay, you're gonna,
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.480]   we both wanna be cremated.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.200]   I said, well, you're gonna at least have my ashes, right?
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.400]   Like, you're gonna, you know.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.680]   She wants me to wear her ashes in a necklace.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.600]   I'm not carrying you around like that.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.120]   That is so bizarre.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.440]   It's not, it's not happening.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.720]   - You don't want my house or my ashes.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:47.640]   - Just real quickly to add to that.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.120]   So, you know, I will repeat what Michelle said
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.040]   about how much we make,
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.240]   but how much we have is also a question.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.160]   When do we reveal to our children how much we have, right?
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.880]   And we didn't talk to them about it very much
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.840]   as they were growing up,
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.240]   because again, for the same reasons, you know.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.120]   But I think at this point, now that they're adults,
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.000]   we're starting to do that.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.280]   And so Olivia knows more probably
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   than Jillian does at this point.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.960]   - Which is like 2%.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.800]   - They're making it sound like we have a lot of knowledge.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.320]   - We do not know very much.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.720]   So like when we have that little conversation,
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.680]   I'm like very excited.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.160]   'Cause I'm like, okay, I'm gonna get the real information
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.360]   on like what's going on, yes.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.080]   - But I think it's important that we do that,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.520]   because I think back to my own situation with my dad.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.600]   And this is going back maybe 10 or 11 years.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.480]   He lived with us just before he passed away.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.840]   And during that time,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.200]   we were doing some estate planning for him.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.480]   And he was not willing at all to talk about how much he had
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.600]   and where his assets were and that sort of thing.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.880]   So it made it rather difficult for us.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.400]   So I resolved in my mind that our kids would know
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.160]   as we get closer to that time,
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.200]   so that it's less complicated and easier for them.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.080]   So, you know, by his standard, I'm doing pretty well.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.280]   You know, that's not really the standard I know
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.120]   that we want to use for our kids.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.920]   But we are now in the stage where I think
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.200]   we're more willing to talk about what we have,
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.480]   where it is, what our wishes are and that sort of thing.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.760]   So I think it's a process, it's a process.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.600]   - A question came in for Olivia and Jillian.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.800]   This is a fun one.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.600]   When and how have you been able to convince your mother
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   to spend money she didn't want to spend?
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.640]   - Have we been able to do that?
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.880]   - Certainly not, no.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   - I don't know.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.560]   I think actually, like I said earlier,
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.360]   I think it's more so that now she's trying to convince us
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.200]   to spend money on things.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.360]   Like I remember, well, I don't know,
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.720]   I don't know if you have like seen her talk or whatever,
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.480]   but I wanted a North Face jacket.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.280]   And she thinks it's very funny because she said,
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.800]   "Can I get you a jacket and face you North?"
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.560]   And ha ha ha, right?
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.440]   So I really, really wanted a North Face jacket.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.520]   And so she's like, "I'm not going to get it for you.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.120]   Like you have to save up for it for yourself."
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   And I remember it was $180.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.320]   And I saved up for it and we went into the Nordstrom
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.360]   and I like got the jacket and I put it on.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.200]   I was like, "Yes."
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.640]   And I was like, "Okay, I have the jacket."
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.000]   And then we like got closer to the register
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.720]   and I was like, "Do I really want this jacket?
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.360]   Like, I don't know."
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.400]   And she was like, "What do you mean?
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.160]   Like you saved for it, we drove all this way,
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.120]   like you like it, it fits, like buy the jacket."
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.240]   And I was like, "Ah, well, you know,
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.800]   like I have other jackets, like it'll be fine."
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.240]   And so I was about to put it back and she was like,
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.360]   "No, like this is how money works.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.000]   Like you saved, you worked for it, like get the jacket."
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.880]   And so I did, I ultimately got the jacket
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.400]   and I wore it for a very long time
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.840]   and then she gave it to Jillian, but it's fine.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.520]   It's fine, I came home from college
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.680]   and I was like, "Where's my jacket?"
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.360]   She's like, "Oh, Jillian has it at Towson."
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.560]   I'm like, "That is my $180 jacket."
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.960]   But whatever, so I don't necessarily know
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.080]   if I have any memories of like trying to get her
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.680]   to like spend something and then she would say no
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.400]   and then she said yes because she's very determined
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.200]   when she makes up her mind to like say no,
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.520]   that there's not a lot of wiggle room on that.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.320]   So it's probably the other way around.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.920]   - I think that's probably the answer
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.040]   to why they don't tell me how much they have.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.360]   I think my sister gives up, but I think I'm still,
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.760]   I still have hope that one day I'll ask for something
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.600]   and it'll be a yes, but maybe not.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.720]   But I have very early memories of asking for stuff
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.160]   and the answer being no,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.160]   and I would be trying to try to be very creative.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.840]   I think she told the story last year
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.560]   about the rule with commercials,
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.240]   where like we were never allowed to buy anything
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.640]   or she was never gonna get us anything
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.240]   that we saw on a commercial.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.880]   And so I went to her and I really wanted something
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.520]   and she was like, "Where did you see it?"
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.920]   And I said, "Oh, you know, I saw it in a dream
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.040]   "and you know, I want it really bad, you know?"
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.280]   But I think that if I stop asking for things
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.360]   then maybe they'll tell me how much they have
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   and then, you know, we can go from there.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.520]   But no, I still have never been able to convince her
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.360]   to buy anything for us.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.080]   - What do we, this is really true.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.440]   So we, there is an appropriate time to tell them
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.680]   and the time is now.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.240]   So we are gonna sit down and lay everything out
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.600]   till we're comfortable because they're ready now.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.200]   But a couple of years ago, I think you were in college,
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.560]   we were sitting at the table, you know,
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.800]   talking about estate planning.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.120]   This is, I know, it's like crazy, right?
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.280]   This is what we talk at the table.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.160]   And so what I was saying, you know,
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.400]   "Well, your dad and I have some money, you know?"
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.320]   And she was like, "How much, this one, how much?"
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.160]   I said, "Well, I'm not gonna tell you."
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   She said, "Is it a lot?
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.080]   "Are you rich?"
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.760]   I said, "Well, you know, some people will say
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.000]   "that we, you know, do okay, we're well off."
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.880]   She said, "So when I get the money?"
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.280]   I said, "Well, you know, we're gonna spend it,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.080]   "but we're gonna leave you some, you know, money
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.360]   "when we die."
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.960]   And she got this look.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.600]   And she said, "Oh, when you die."
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.000]   And I said, "Okay, so I'm telling all of y'all now,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.840]   "if I, something happens to me mysteriously, you know,
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.360]   "send the police that way."
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.600]   (laughing)
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.520]   But we try to, we don't, we, they really didn't know.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.120]   They thought we were, like, we didn't want them to know
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.920]   how well off.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.680]   And I think one of them did say, "Oh, you're rich."
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.680]   I said, "No."
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.800]   She said, "We are rich."
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.640]   That's what you said.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.480]   "We are rich."
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.560]   I said, "No, you mistaken, we rich."
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.280]   - So there's another question here
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.480]   that I think is a good one.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.880]   "What can I do to educate my college son
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.440]   "about the realities of money without squashing
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.520]   "his dream job, keeping him from pursuing his dream job
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.280]   "of being a zoologist?"
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.840]   - So are they, do they not want them to be a zoologist?
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.880]   Is that the-- - Well, maybe it's not
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.400]   the highest paying job.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.600]   They want him to be aware of money,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.120]   but still reach for that job
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.320]   that isn't the highest paying job.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.880]   - Well, you might wanna ask them, but I wouldn't do that.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.520]   I think you have to let people operate
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.240]   in the gifting that they were.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.760]   I mean, in our culture, it's like STEM, STEM, STEM,
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.840]   and this, this, this.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.720]   But you all have worked a lot your whole life.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.120]   I love what I do.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.960]   I love being a journalist.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.920]   I love writing.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.200]   My husband loved being an engineer and then a manager,
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.760]   and we want that for our children.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.720]   Now, what we have taught them is how to live
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.280]   on a teacher's salary.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.400]   What we have taught them is how to live as a therapist.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   And maybe they might not make six-figure salaries,
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   but trust me on that.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.480]   They will retire with more money than people
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.400]   who make six-figure salaries.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.000]   And so I, we never steered them.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.320]   I don't think we ever steered them in a particular.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.680]   When she said she wanted to be a teacher,
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.400]   it was like, it was the proudest moment
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.280]   because I don't know about you all,
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.000]   but it was a teacher who changed my life,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.280]   and I would not want to rob another child of that.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.440]   (audience applauding)
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:14.040]   Because it was a teacher who, I won a scholarship
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.160]   to the University of Maryland at College Park,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.040]   and when the scholarship came out because of my background,
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.480]   I didn't want to apply for it because I thought,
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   first of all, how are they gonna give it to me?
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   I come from this broken home.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.280]   My grandfather's an alcoholic.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.760]   We, you know, we ate, but we didn't have a lot.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.960]   I had like a couple of outfits to wear to school.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.840]   They're not gonna give this to this little poor kid
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.440]   from West Baltimore.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.160]   And I wouldn't apply for the scholarship.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.360]   And she ran me down and hunted me down for weeks.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.800]   And finally, she just like took me by the shoulder.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.320]   She said, listen, if you apply,
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.880]   you already have a no if you don't apply.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.160]   Imagine if you apply and you get a yes.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.520]   And so I applied for the scholarship, 10 finalists.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.000]   I was one of 10, two from my school,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.280]   and the other person who won from my school
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.920]   was in a fashion ed club.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.720]   She came from a wealthy family,
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.600]   and it's like, oh, she's gonna get it for real.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.320]   And I went down to the son for the interview,
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.680]   and I just told him, you know, what my life was like,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.720]   and I won that scholarship.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.420]   And I would have never won that
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.480]   if it hadn't been for that educator.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.560]   So I don't think you discourage your kids.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.140]   You just show them how to make money for where they are.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.420]   And eventually, if they're good money managers
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.800]   and they can't quite make it,
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.320]   they will figure out how to get a second job,
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.280]   or maybe in their case, all three of our kids living at home.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.880]   And everyone is like, oh, you just don't wanna let 'em go,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.020]   and you just gotta let 'em be out there.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.600]   But my God, they can, she can save, you know,
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.000]   nearly $1,000 in a non-retirement account, and she's 15%.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.560]   She saved, I think this past year,
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.840]   probably 80% of her salary.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.760]   And if I could just get her to sign up
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.240]   for her 401, 312 rebate.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.480]   Their brother is the same way.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.560]   And so they, you know, it is,
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.820]   it was intentional for them to live at home.
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.720]   So instead of, and we don't have anything,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.920]   a problem with renting,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.600]   but we know that they wanna be homeowners.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.120]   So if they stay home long enough
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.280]   and save 80% of their salary,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.960]   when they walk into the door of their house,
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.560]   their house will be almost half paid off.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.300]   What a legacy, if they could be homeowners,
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.800]   true homeowners, without a mortgage.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.160]   By the time they hit their 40s or 50s,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.320]   my God, that's life-changing.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.440]   And they won't have to worry so much
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.340]   about spending down their retirement account,
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.520]   because they removed the most expensive thing
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.440]   on their budget.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.520]   And so don't discourage your kids.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.500]   Encourage them, show them, say no.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.480]   Say no to your grandkids.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   It's not, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's a legacy.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   You know, this didn't happen by accident.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.320]   I am so, we are so proud of these girls.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.680]   It didn't happen by accident.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.360]   And it wasn't easy.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.080]   They are nice and loving and look at them smiling,
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.480]   but trust me on this, they hated us.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.140]   Or me, I should say, 'cause their dad is like,
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.560]   really like, "No, baby."
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.840]   And I'm like, "Nope."
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.480]   I don't know, did you want to?
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.240]   - We didn't hate you, that's really intense.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.260]   There was a lot of like, what's going on over there?
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.720]   Like, why are there being, you know,
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   so annoying about things?
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.120]   But we didn't like hate them,
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.280]   'cause eventually we adjusted, right?
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.960]   Like kids are really adaptable.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.800]   And so I think when they are living under a certain,
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.040]   you know, rule system or parent household
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.300]   or like money management system, like they, we adapted.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.880]   And so it got to the point where then I started
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.040]   to look at other people funny when they were judging me
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.520]   for not having things.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.820]   And so then, you know, my mindset shifted over time.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.720]   And so like, yes, there were a lot of times
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.040]   where I was very angry or I didn't understand,
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.800]   or it was really annoying to be told over and over again,
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.920]   is that a need or a want, is that a need or a want?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.960]   I'm like, I just want it, like, why can't I like just,
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.440]   I just want it, like, you know,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.240]   like I'm not allowed to want things.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.400]   But over time, you know, like we came around to it
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.960]   or it just stopped being something that we,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.000]   well, maybe not for Jillian, but I just stopped asking.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.760]   So I was like, well, after so many no's,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.320]   it's like, okay, fine, I just won't have the thing.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.480]   And that's fine.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.000]   And so I think it's, you know, just about like trusting
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.120]   that your kids will adapt to it and then they'll grow up
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.080]   and eventually, hopefully they'll come around to it.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.480]   - Well, McIntyre family,
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.280]   we are so grateful for you to have come here.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.840]   We knew you loved Michelle, but thank you all so much.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:49.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
