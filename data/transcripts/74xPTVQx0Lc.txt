[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   It doesn't know where it's going so last month you might have noticed something Google actually announced that they had met the exact
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.400]   Location of every single residence and every single business in the entirety of France every single house number
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.760]   Now if you were tasked with that job
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.600]   What would you need me a hundred people for a year?
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.680]   What did Google do Google used an algorithm which did that entire process in one hour?
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.880]   They met every single residence and business exact location in one hour. How did they do it?
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.520]   well, they started with Google Street View which is hundreds of millions of images and
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.320]   They used a machine learning algorithm
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.480]   Machine learning algorithms are algorithms that you don't really program in the traditional sense
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.400]   But you just give it a sense of what you're trying to do and it figures it out
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   so in this case they took a few hundred street numbers and kind of circled them and
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.240]   Said to the algorithm look for stuff like this and read them the algorithm did the rest
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.780]   Very similar with this with this project looking for these areas. It's got green arrows are areas that are called mitosis
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.880]   These are the most terrifying parts of the breast cancer tumor
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.520]   These were hand marked up by a team of four expert pathologists working in unison
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.800]   That's because actually doing this is very very difficult to any two pathologists on the team only agreed with each other 50% of the time
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.600]   they then took this expert assessment for thousands of breast cancer images and they sent it to a
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.080]   machine learning algorithm
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.320]   the machine learning algorithm then automatically identified mitosis and thousands more images and it had a
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.860]   60% overlap with the shared committee view so
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.440]   Algorithm is better than any expert pathologist in the world and identifying this incredibly difficult thing of ptosis
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.240]   This is actually happening again and again
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.780]   I was involved in a project a couple of years ago for Merck and they wanted to know can we find
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.680]   Molecules ahead of time which are likely to be toxic and you probably know the punchline
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.440]   The team that I was involved with did not try and program that but instead gave examples of a whole lot of toxic molecules
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.600]   to a machine learning algorithm
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.440]   It took only two weeks for the whole project and at the end of it
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.040]   Was a system that was much better than Merck and much better than anybody in academia or industry had ever developed for identifying
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.800]   toxic molecules
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.100]   I'll tell you something else in each one of these systems
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.160]   They were developed by people with no previous background in this area
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.240]   So for example this in the Merck
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.400]   example both developed by machine learning experts who had no previous background in biology and
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.260]   Generally these things take days or maybe a couple of weeks
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.720]   It's not just in medical and imaging areas
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.040]   This is also being used in language in fact on your Android phone when you're using
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.600]   Voice recognition it's using this kind of machine learning system. And in fact, I'll tell you something else
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.640]   Not only are all these best in class algorithms using machine learning rather than traditional programming
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.200]   They're using the exact same algorithm one algorithm
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.960]   It's called deep learning and it's actually based on the computing process that the human brain uses
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.280]   We're now at a point whether the hardware the computer hardware can
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.680]   Approximate that well enough that we are seeing the best in class performance other examples the world's best algorithm for
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:52.240]   Translating English speech into Mandarin speech in the original inflection of the original speakers voice again is a deep learning algorithm
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:00.200]   So we're at a point now where a single algorithm, which is actually getting multiplicatively better every year
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.160]   The more data you give it the more computing power you give it the better
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.720]   It gets is now at or better than human performance at the very things
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:17.360]   Which humans spend most of their time doing all the blue areas here are countries where over 80% of?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.760]   employment is in services
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.920]   More specifically for example in the US
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.520]   55% of employment is actually an information processing. This is the exact thing that these algorithms are now at or better than human performance at and
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.240]   getting multiplicatively better every year
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   So there are opportunities for example for your organizations these same algorithms are actually also the best in the world at identifying churn
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.240]   credit scoring at the
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.720]   Prioritization you know any of your organizations that that use these approaches will get ahead those that don't will fall behind
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.640]   So it has a big commercial opportunity as well
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   I think about the other side every single organization which is doing this is actually replacing
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.280]   Human jobs the most common jobs with machines this has happened once before
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.080]   And the Industrial Revolution
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.540]   Before that most people were working in manufacturing and agriculture
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.720]   Suddenly those jobs didn't exist anymore because machines did it better
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.800]   Did you know that the decades afterwards 80% of workers were much worse off in fact 80% of workers?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.280]   Did not have a basic living wage
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.560]   Incredibly disruptive
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.680]   What is this going to mean for us when all of the people currently in the services sector of many of them find themselves?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.100]   Literally unable to add economic value because the computers are getting more applicatively better every year
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.840]   So you might be thinking this is all very nice in theory, but you know wouldn't you expect to have seen something in practice by now?
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.740]   Wouldn't you expect to have already seen that like the the value of human capital is not keeping up with the improvements in productivity?
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.320]   Well, yes, you would
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.560]   In fact the value of human capital as expressed in median income has been flat for the last 15 years
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.940]   And it's now starting to go down at the very same time
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.540]   That productivity overall in the economy has kept increasing and increasing
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.980]   So what I wanted to tell you today is be aware of the exciting opportunities for all of your organizations from machine learning
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.320]   But also be aware of the threats to our socioeconomic systems that will come in the future
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.560]   And let's start to think about both the opportunities and the threats
