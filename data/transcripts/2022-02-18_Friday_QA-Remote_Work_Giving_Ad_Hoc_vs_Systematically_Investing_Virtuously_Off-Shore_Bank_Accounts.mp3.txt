[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Well, thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I have been out of work for about a year,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   a little bit more, actually.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And I recently got a job, a new position I'm going to be starting soon.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And I have a bit of concerns.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   One is I have to brush up on a new domain in my field quite a bit
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   that I don't have experience with.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But the other bigger one that I was hoping you could help with was,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   even though I had worked from home prior to being laid off for about nine
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   months, I never really kind of got into a full groove.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I did good things like getting dressed every day and having a dedicated
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   space, but I never felt as effective working from home as I did in the office.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Also, I kind of always felt bad for people who started work from home
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and never got the in-person experience with the coworkers like I had.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So this job is fully remote.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And I just wonder if you have any advice or opinions on both working
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   effectively as a remote worker from home, which I assume you do,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and also with connecting with colleagues in a meaningful way.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's fully remote and it's expected to be fully remote into the future?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's correct.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I will have the opportunity to travel.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm sure right now it's as needed only,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   but hopefully I'll be able to connect directly with the people in the
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   offices eventually.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But my role is fully remote, yeah.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Are you aware of whether or not the company has things like quarterly
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   in-person meetings or an annual retreat or something that facilitates
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   in-person connection?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I'm not yet, but I assume when things get back to whatever they call normal,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   they will probably institute some form of that.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And they may do some virtually as well.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It seems like it's kind of a company that would foster that sort of thing.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Well, I think that the future, in my opinion,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I think the future is that most of our work is done at a distance,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   but that we facilitate opportunities for in-person connection.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I think that there's no question that there are many benefits to the
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   fully in-person environment, but in today's world,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   it seems like there are the countervailing benefits for a remote work
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   environment are also quite significant.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So I think many companies are going to find themselves in a place where
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   most of the work that is done is done remotely.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then that they solve some of the needs for human connection,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   for relationships, et cetera, with being together in person,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   quarterly meetings, an annual retreat, team building exercises,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   things like that.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   That's my guess as far as what I think is going to happen going forward.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And my reasons, the reasons that I think that is true,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   if you look at the advantages for both the employer and the employee of having
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   remote work, they are very, very high.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The advantages for the employer involve vastly lower costs,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   meaning significantly cheaper, no need for big, giant office buildings,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   no need to maintain a bunch of real estate,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   just simply send the employee a computer and give them a stipend for their
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   internet connection.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And so I think that there are a lot of lower costs.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   We're getting better at being able to count, figure out productivity.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Basically companies now are accustomed to the fact that they have to have new
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   metrics that don't just involve seeing someone's face in the office to know
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   whether they're working or not.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And so I think they're getting better.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Now there's no question I think that there are some companies that have said,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "No, it doesn't work for us.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It doesn't work for our culture.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   We want to have an environment where people are physically together."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And so there's going to be competition,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   but I think a lot of workers also so much appreciate the ability to be remote
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and to work remotely and all of the lifestyle benefits that opens up,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   that they're making sure that they take those remote jobs.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So I expect the future to be kind of a mixture of them.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So what do you do?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It is a real problem for you in terms of how do you make a good impression,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   how do you build those kinds of relationships.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So to begin with, for you,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I think the most important thing is to know what you're actually being hired to
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   do.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You have to be very, very clear on what the metrics are.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   What am I going to be judged based upon what criteria am I going to be judged?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So you need to know what is expected of you.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   What are your performance metrics?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And then you need to make sure that you're hitting your performance metrics.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   There are little things that you could do,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   but at the end of the day, it's all about performance.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And so if you know what you're going to be judged on and you can hit those
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   performance metrics, then that will be excellent for you.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think one of the things that is extraordinarily important is to have a
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   really good workspace.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And this here, you have to just look at your house,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   look at your work environment,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   consider your children and ask yourself if you have an appropriate workspace.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Having children, I think, is a major challenge to being at home.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   The noise, the interruptions,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   the kind of connectedness with the household,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   all of that can be a major impediment to your getting work done.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And so you have to find a solution that allows you to work effectively.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I think some of the best solutions,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   certainly if you have a great basement office where it's separate from the
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   house, if you've got,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   if you can convert a part of your garage to make it separate and sound
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   isolated by putting some sort of office in your garage, that's good.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   A backyard shed if you're in kind of a suburban neighborhood,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   but if you put in a really great backyard shed and that becomes your office,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   these are all good options that I think are worth investing into because you
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   want to know, you want to have the confidence of knowing I can go to work and I
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   can get work done so that you have a reliable, consistent work environment.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think what you definitely want to do is you want to invest into proper
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   working infrastructure, whatever that is for you.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So if that means a standup desk or, you know,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   a walking desk, if it means a really great office chair,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   if it means the right internet connections,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   if it means a great camera setup, if you're going to be on zoom all the time,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   make sure that you've got a great camera setup to make everything simple and
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   easy. And so, so you can perform your job effectively,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   so you can hear everyone well, et cetera,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and just deliver on your performance metrics. Now, in terms of actually,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   in terms of actually connecting with coworkers,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I would prioritize any kind of in-person opportunity.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I don't know, meaning what I mean is maybe there's some techniques,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   maybe sending good email emails and being showing up in the Slack channel in
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   an appropriate way.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Maybe those are good ways of establishing great interpersonal connections.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But I think the most important thing is when possible,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   make friends with your coworkers so that you can,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   so that when there are questions in online communication,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   those questions are weighed in the context of a relationship with a real
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   person. I think what's very difficult about online communication is,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   especially with so much written communication, so much, you know,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   so many Slack channels and et cetera,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   being the primary way of communicating is it's hard to convey those
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   interpersonal things that tell whether you're serious or whether you're
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   joking about something. And so I think to the, as quickly as possible,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   build the personal relationships when possible so that that facilitates
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   the other more difficult communication channels.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Beyond that, you know, as with anything, learn the company culture,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   get in there and figure out who your boss is,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   figure out how to make them happy. And if you do that, things work well.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I don't have any special wisdom though, beyond that,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   other than to say that those who find a job that's a good fit for them,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   find out what their performance metrics are and do it effectively,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   those people will always win no matter the context.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I appreciate it. Thank you.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I'd already re-listened to some of your audio from the courses that I took
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   from you and all that stuff was really helpful as well. So thank you.

[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I was last on the show to ask your thoughts about how I might grow my blog,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but since then I've not focused directly on growing the blog.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I think the 20/80 rule you've talked about before is applicable.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That my purpose behind the blog was really, I love teaching and coaching.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And I found that I can get more leverage by pivoting my day job to doing that.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Wonderful.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And so I've recently started a new role in my organization where I do some
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   corporate training and I'm working on my organization's learning and people
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   development strategy, but it's only a temporary role through the end of June.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And so that's got me thinking on what do I want to do next for my next role?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And I've been doing your career and income course,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and I was struck by the part where you said you've considered corporate
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   training before because you love teaching.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And so I wanted to ask you what were some of the different career paths you've
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   considered to indulge your love of teaching and how did you decide which one
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   was best for you?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So I think that when you realize that you genuinely enjoy teaching,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   it opens up so many different avenues.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I could, I believe if I were hireable,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I could very happily be a high school teacher.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I could teach a number of subjects.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   There's a number of things that I would thoroughly enjoy teaching on and I could
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   be happy as anything just in a local high school working as a high school
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   teacher. I could enjoy teaching college, being a college professor.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   A friend of mine who I was recently talking with,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   who was interviewing for a job as a college professor and I was going over
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   again and I was surprised I really reviewed with him.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I was like, here's all the reasons why I think this is such a wonderful,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   a wonderful job,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   just an amazing opportunity to be in this kind of very stimulating environment
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   where,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   so I would genuinely derive a significant amount of joy from those two things.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I say that because don't brush past them.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Usually we brush past things like being a high school teacher because of limited
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   income,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   but the income can be plenty to live a very comfortable lifestyle on.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And so,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and then in,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   and in addition,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   you can always do other things for income as well.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So if you are someone who's thinking about a career change,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   you could be a very great fit for simply going and being a traditional teacher
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   in a traditional classroom.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So that would be something worth considering.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   If you go beyond that,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   then like I mentioned with being a corporate trainer,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   there is,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   there are teaching opportunities in virtually all industries,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   virtually all companies.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And when you recognize that what you're skilled at or what you enjoy is being a
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   teacher,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   then you can just simply identify one of those things,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   one of those,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   those niches that you would enjoy teaching in.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And if you enjoy the classroom environment,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   the world's open to you.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And I think we're also living in a really wonderful environment for independent
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   teachers,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   whether that's independent teachers in a traditional format locally,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   or whether it's independent teachers teaching virtually to broader audiences.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   I can think of a number of topics that I'm interested in where there are people
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   who make their living.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They have,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   they create a small platform in their area of skill,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   area of expertise,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   and then they,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   they host regular classes and it's,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   they get people from across the country to come in,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   sit for their classes,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   and they make their living on that.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And if you run the numbers on how profitable it can be to sell tuition to your
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   courses,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   the numbers can make it very,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   very doable for an independent teacher.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Right?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   If you can imagine that you're doing something where you're selling a weekend
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   seminar and you sell the weekend seminar for say $300 and it's an area of your
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   expertise,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   if you can put 30 people in a room at 300,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   $300 depending on what your level of expenses are,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   there's a $9,000 weekend.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And there are all kinds of little niches and little interesting things where you
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   can put 30 people in a room regularly
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   without having the world's biggest brand.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And then when it comes to the world of online education,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   it opens up so much and,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and the world is hungry for people who do things well.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   So here I think online you have in many cases much higher levels of competition
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   where you have to be better,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   you have to be more skilled.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   But if you're interested in teaching something and you simply teach it well,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   you can create a system that will be very powerful over time.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Right?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Everything about teaching online rewards high quality and,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and over time growing monetization.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   So whether you're teaching English,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   whether you're teaching some specific skill,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   the ability to access the world's markets with a very low cost of advertising,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   focusing primarily on simply your high quality of information makes this one of
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   the world's best times ever to be a teacher because it's a time in which
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   ordinary people who previously wouldn't have been able to reach a global stage
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   without having the right connections can now simply rely upon the strength of
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   their communication skills and the quality of their teaching in order to be
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   found by the marketplace.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   So that's my little speech on it,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   but those are the,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   when I look at those I see any number of ways that somebody who enjoys being a
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   teacher or wants to be a teacher can analyze his life and can say,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   here's what I need now,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   here's what I need in the future and here's how I'll grow it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   So,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   you know,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   recently I was watching some videos from a guy who teaches German online.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   He's a high school German teacher in a little town in the middle of nowhere in
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   the United States.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   He has his day job,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   but he also has his online German teaching platform.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And so that's just an example where you could take and say,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I'm going to have a job,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I'm going to have a job that allows me to do my basic day to day work,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   pays my bills,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   et cetera,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   keeps my finances stable,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   but I'm going to take my 15 hours on the side and I'm going to really invest it
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   into something that has much more leverage than teaching in my local high
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   school.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Yeah,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   that's a good overview.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Thank you.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Do you have,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   or do you want to share the kinds of things that you enjoy teaching about?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Sure.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Yeah,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I really enjoy teaching about leadership,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   personal growth.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I like reading about history and figuring out what lessons on leadership and
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   love and personal growth we can find from it.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And then I also enjoy teaching technical things,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   my backgrounds in industrial engineering.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So things like programming and Python or something like that.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I've been getting ready to teach a course in that at my organization.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   So kind of a mix of soft skills and technical skills.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So I think the challenge is if just simply choosing one that you think is the
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   most interesting one for you to start with,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   any one of those can be turned into an independent business and independent
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   career.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I'm very,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   very powerfully,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   but the key is simply choosing one and that you think has the best appeal to
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   you personally.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And then thinking through a business model that you think could be effective
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   for you.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I mean I could take any one of them and create a model for it.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   But what I would say is take my,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   my advice would be make that list of interests and then go and find people who
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   are already doing in your area of interest who are already applying those
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   skills and then see who you admire,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   see who you would personally want to model in terms of your approach.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I think that makes sense.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Cool.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Keep in touch.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Let me know how things go as it unfolds.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Frank,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   welcome to the show.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Hi Joshua.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I've got two questions today if there's time.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   First one in,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   in tithing or giving,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   how should,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   how should I balance saving up a giving balance for some future giving
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   opportunity versus supporting currently known charitable organizations that I
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   want to support regularly?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So I think you did a podcast about tithing in the past and you kind of,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   the words you use were like systematic contributions of support versus like
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   ad hoc financial contributions for others.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Right,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   right.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Well,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I think you begin with saying who do you want to support?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Because if you start by identifying the specific organization or person or
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   people or thing that you're wishing to invest your money into,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   that's going to give you the idea of what's the best way to invest into them.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   When you come to,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   to supporting an organization that's very,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   or a person on an ongoing basis,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   that's very different than supporting just somebody when you see needs on
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   occasion.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And you'll probably do both.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   If you're tithing to your local church,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   then you're going to want to make sure that you're providing those tithes
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   regularly on an ongoing basis so that the treasurers can make more reliable
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   forecasts as to their cashflow and then manage the money more effectively.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   If you're using some of your funds to support someone like a missionary,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   that missionary will greatly appreciate having a sense of stability in his
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   finances, knowing that,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   "Hey,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I'm receiving $300 a month from this particular donor.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That way I can go forward and I can make various investments and financial
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   decisions based upon having that consistent level of money."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   So I think that those are very valuable.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And if you are,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   certainly you're going to be giving to an organization that you believe in.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So in that case,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   you want the organization to succeed.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And so if you observe the fact that you want that the organization will,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   will thrive from ongoing contributions,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   then try to set it up so that you can make ongoing contributions.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   The ad hoc giving,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I think can be very powerful because there are many needs that are genuine,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   true needs that are well-served with an ad hoc gift rather than ongoing
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   support.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So when it comes to charitable needs for somebody,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I'm much more,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   let's say that I'm,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   there's somebody that I'm trying to support.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I see a person who's in need.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I would,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I'm much more excited,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   generally speaking,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   about making an ad hoc gift or a few non-scheduled gifts in order to eliminate
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   a sense of dependency by that person.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   If you're not,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   if let's say you're just simply helping somebody who lost their job and they
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   need some financial support and you're making a mortgage payment or you're
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   buying some food or you're making just a one-time cash gift,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   I think that's more powerful because it helps to solve the specific need the
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   person has without the deleterious effects of ongoing support,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   which can lead to a person becoming complacent,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   lazy,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   et cetera.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   The kind of the classic example is just look at unemployment.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   When people get unemployment,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   when they get laid off from a job,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   they don't start looking for a job seriously until their unemployment starts
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   to run out.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Then they start looking for a job.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And so you can take the same benefit of supporting an organization or a
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   missionary or something like that,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and it becomes a downside in other giving situations.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So I would just say,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   look at what you're trying to accomplish and recognize that in general,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   if you're trying to make a big change,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   you're probably going to want to prioritize systematic giving and systematic
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   contributions.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But that's not to say that you shouldn't also make space for those ad hoc
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   gifts because having the funds available when they're needed can be really,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   really helpful.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And I think that also the other comment I would make is that sometimes I'm
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   more comfortable giving larger amounts of money when they're not on an ongoing
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   basis.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So I might be uncomfortable signing up for a pledge of a certain amount of
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   giving on an ongoing basis.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   But if I know that I'm just going to give on a one-time basis or on a
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   couple-time basis,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I can be more generous because I know that I haven't made a commitment to a
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   person or an organization over time.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Dr. Yeah, that all makes sense.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And those are good points.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Is there time for a second question?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Okay.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So how can I invest virtuously,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   especially within like a Roth IRA or 401k?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And is blindly investing and index funds,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   like does that hold some sort of negative moral weight given, you know,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   the big giant corporations that the monies are invested in?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I mean,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   from my own kind of understanding of how the stock market works,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   when you buy a stock,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   you're buying a share of ownership in the company at a given price in hopes
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   that the value will go up to sell it later.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Like at a later date or to receive a dividend,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   but you're not actually contributing money to the company itself.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Right.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   So any thoughts on that?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Well, this is not an easy or a simple topic,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   but I'll give you a few thoughts that I think are useful when considering it
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   to begin with,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   what would it mean to invest in a virtuous way?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Or I prefer the word righteous to invest in a righteous way.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   You would have to have some kind of standard to know if I'm investing my money
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and it's getting this outcome,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   then it's I'm investing in a righteous way.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   My answer as to kind of what it would mean to invest in a righteous way means
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   that people,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   human beings are being bettered by the activity.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   They're the,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   the,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   the opportunities,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   the human beings are improving.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   The lives of the human beings are improving.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   The,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   my basic background for that of course comes from Christian doctrine.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And if I reflect and I try to boil down to its most basic form,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   the,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   the distinctives of Christian religious teaching,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   I think that at its core,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   there needs to be a prioritization of the well-being of people.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   So I always go back to the teaching of Jesus.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Jesus said,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   and where thieves break in and steal.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   For where your treasure is there your heart will be also."
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   So when I have thought about that over the years,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   what eventually brought me a place of peace and clarity was when I asked
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   myself,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   how,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   how would it be possible to lay up treasures in heaven?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   How would you actually do that?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And I think that there are a number of answers to it,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   but my answer comes down to what is in heaven.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And if you think about what is in heaven,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   what is in heaven is of course the person of God, the angels,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   but most importantly,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   the souls of men.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   That is what is in heaven.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And so if I say,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   how do I lay up treasures in heaven?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Then it's going to have something to do with the souls of men.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Now frequently,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Christians think about that in a very pious,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   direct religious context,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   meaning that the goal is to get more souls into heaven.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And I believe that's true and accurate.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   That's something that we should consider.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   But I think it makes sense to me to expand it more broadly and to say that I
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   lay up treasures in heaven when I invest into the soul of a man.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   So let's go and think about Jesus with the teaching of the Good Samaritan.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Here's this guy who is beaten and robbed,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   left to die on the side of the road.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   All these people come by,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   religious leaders go by,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   they ignore him.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   But then here comes the Samaritan.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And remember,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   this was a very shocking sermon that Jesus was teaching because the Jews hated
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Samaritans.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And so here comes the Samaritan.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   The Samaritan sees a man who is in need and the Samaritan goes over and he
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   loads the man onto his donkey,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   takes him to an inn and tells the innkeeper,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   I have to continue my journey,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   but I will pay for whatever the needs are for you to care for this man.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   So did the Samaritan invest and lay up treasures in heaven in that example?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Clearly yes.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   That's why Jesus told the parable.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   So we could see that something like helping a man who's bleeding and bruised
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   on the side of the road would be a decent way to lay up a treasure in heaven by
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   investing into the well-being,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   the betterment of this particular human soul.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I think you could expand it out beyond that though.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   And so anything that winds up improving the lot of people is something that I
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   want to consider investing into.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   That will in and of itself bring a dividing line.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Now I haven't gone yet to the question of profit because some people would say,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   well, profit is not, you know,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   we shouldn't do that.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   That means that charity is the way that you fulfill what Jesus said to lay up
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   treasures in heaven.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   You do it with giving money away,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   but you don't do it with investing by a profit.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   When I look at the world,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   I don't see that to be the case.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I think that the profit-seeking,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   a profit-seeking enterprise in many ways is a superior,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   a morally superior creature,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   a morally superior system than a not-for-profit enterprise is.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   That's not to say that all things should be for profit.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I think there clearly are some things that are not for profit.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And profit is not per se good.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   It's not by definition always good.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   There are many things that we don't do for profit.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   There are so many things that we don't put out for a bid.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   But if you look at the world,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   many of the problems that we face in the world are solved much more effectively
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   with a profit-seeking institution than they are with a charitable institution.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And in fact, the charitable institutions are obvious,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   are often harmful.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   For a number of years,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I've had planned to do this show,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   which I haven't gotten around to,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   basically saying like,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   don't feel good about yourself by giving to a non-profit or creating a non-for-profit,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   not-for-profit entity.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Not-for-profit entities are often leeches on society.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   They are not productive, useful enterprises.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   They don't have any ability to sustain themselves,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and thus they can't grow.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And they have to just have this constant flow of funds and donations in order to function.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Whereas many times a for-profit company can solve the same problem
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   that a not-for-profit company could.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And instead of it being a leech on society,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   something that has to be funded on an ongoing basis,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   it can fund itself.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And so you want to see productivity.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   And in the kingdom of God, productivity is a fundamentally important part.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Think of the parable of the steward,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   meaning the parable of the talents.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   You want to see a system produce.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   If you look at nature itself,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   nature is wildly productive.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And lack of productivity is something not to be appreciated,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   it's something to be cared for.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Jesus cursed the fig tree when it wouldn't produce fruit.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   So if you look at a problem,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   let's say you see that there are a lot of people who are being beaten on this certain road,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and you see an opportunity to say,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   "What if I come in here and I start a security company,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   and let's secure this road and have people pay to protect us?"
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I would see that as a basic extension of the principle of care for neighbor,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   of love for neighbor,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and of investing into souls.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So I look at the business world,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   and I see how systematically so many of the basic needs of mankind
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   have been met in the very best ways by investing into them.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And so I believe that you can invest into a for-profit company
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and feel very good about that
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   as long as the products or the services that that company is providing
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   are not harming people.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So now you get into a classic question.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Well, how would you know if a product or a service is harming people?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   There's often been the classic question about companies that create drugs
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   or companies that create alcohol.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Is alcohol harming people?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Many people don't want to invest into a company that's harming people.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I have a major issue with investing into companies that make their profits off of war.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   There's a fundamentally evil system of incentives for me to go
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   and for me to invest into Northrop Grumman or Raytheon
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   or one of these companies that makes its profit
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   based upon this giant war machine on a global basis
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   that kills millions and millions and millions of people.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   So I have a great deal of difficulty with that.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   On the other hand, somebody might look at it and see it from the other perspective
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and say, "Well, these are the machines of war that are in the hands of the good people,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   and they're the things that are holding things back."
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So some might be more obvious, some might be less obvious,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   but then you go into a world and you say, "Well, what about something like, say, Facebook?"
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Is Facebook a net good on society or is Facebook a net harm on society?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And it becomes much more difficult for you to say as an investor, "For sure."
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   I could argue either side.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   I could argue that Facebook has been one of the greatest positive influences in society
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   and in the world.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   On the other hand, I could argue that it's been one of the greatest negative influences
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   on society and on the world.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And the truth is we're usually not competent to judge in the here and now
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   what the actual impact of these companies is going to be.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   So now back to your question, right?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   How would you invest the money in your 401(k) in a way that gives you a sense of certainty
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   about that you're investing it righteously?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Well, it's hard.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   It's almost impossible to do because generally speaking, you're not going to actually know
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   the companies that are being invested into.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And in the modern world, unless you are choosing individual companies
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and you're choosing companies that you believe are a net good on society,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   in the modern world, you're going to be stuck to a system of mutual funds.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And those mutual funds are either going to be selected by an active manager
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   or they're simply going to reflect what is done in the marketplace,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   meaning that they're the companies that are listed in the S&P 500
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   or listed on the stock market.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So thus, they're in a total stock market fund.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And that can be difficult.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And I don't say that any man is wrong for doing it, but a number of years ago,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   I looked at it and I just thought like there's just too much here
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   that I'm uncomfortable with.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I don't want to invest in this kind of broad scale way.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It doesn't make me feel good to do that.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   So you would have to judge your own conscience, let your own conscience be your guide
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   and make your choices systematically.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   What I would say is in general, you're going to wind up in a few different situations
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   if this is a big deal to you.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Number one, you will either have to say, "I'm just going to not worry about it with this money."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   That's what many people do.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   "I have my retirement money and I'm not going to worry about it with my retirement money."
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And many people just invest broadly because their conscience doesn't hurt them.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Or you're going to have to say, "I'm going to choose some individual companies."
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Because it's not possible for you to stay researched and in tune on thousands of companies.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   But you could stay tuned in on a handful of companies,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   companies that you believe are doing good in the world,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   that are solving problems in the world, etc.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   I would submit to you that a company like Walmart is a wonderful company
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   that has systematically solved so many problems on a global basis
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and helps people to live better because it exists.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   So I would have no problem owning Walmart stock.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   You can go through and you can say the other companies that you think are a good example.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   But at the end of the day, I always find it interesting that I think more people boycott
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   their purchase decisions way more companies than they boycott with their investment decisions.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And I don't understand why they don't take that thinking
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and just simply choose carefully the companies that they invest in.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I think at the end of the day you'll find it very hard to invest in publicly traded companies
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   that are large and not have some kind of moral component to them.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   We live in a world where the lines are not clear.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   The good actors and the bad actors are not clear.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I can look at Walmart and I can say, "Oh, I appreciate all the things that Walmart has done
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   for the good of the world." And another person will come along and say,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   "Walmart is the biggest worst blight on mankind ever."
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   That's a good argument to make, but people will look at it from different perspectives.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And if you look at many of the largest companies,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   my biggest issue with a lot of the largest companies is that they use government power
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and crony capitalism to further their ends.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And I consider crony capitalism to be one of the greatest evils of our day.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   And at its core, something that is damaging to public trust
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and to upright and righteous living.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   They're all involved in that, though, so what do you do?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   I think that the other answer is you don't have to invest in publicly traded companies.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   You kind of do if you're going to deal with your Roth IRA,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   unless you're going to go ahead and do a self-directed Roth IRA.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And of course many people do that.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   But if you really want to invest for good, you might look at another scale,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   at a more human scale.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   So you can look in your local community and say,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   "Here's a business that would really help my local community.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   My local community lacks such and such a business.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   A gathering place for people or an after-school tutoring program, etc."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And just invest your money there.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Because then the ethical concerns are closer at hand
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and you can have a better confidence in what's actually happening
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   or what's not happening.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   But it's a very difficult set of things to argue through and to think through.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   And at the end of the day, I think you're probably going to wind up
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   where most of us wind up, which is a muddy mixture.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   We would love to be pure.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   We would love to be ideologically pure.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   But I don't think that that is really possible in this current environment.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   - Right. Yeah, I agree.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And again, great points.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Lots to think about.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Yeah, I guess that's kind of like why I mentioned,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   as far as my understanding of how the stock market works,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   even though you might be investing your money with a company,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   again, from my understanding,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   it's not like the company is directly profiting from that investment.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   It's just you deciding to buy a share of the company,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   again, in hopes that the value will go up
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   or you receive a dividend from them.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   - Yeah, I didn't address that directly.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Let me address it quickly.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   You are technically correct that when there is a company
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   whose stock is being traded on a public exchange,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   when you invest into that company,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   the company is not directly receiving your money.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Rather, the seller of the stock is receiving your money.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   You go and you purchase $20 worth of shares.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   It's the seller of the stock, another individual owner,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   who is receiving the money, not the company directly.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   But I don't think that that solves your moral problem
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   because at its core,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   the market for the stock is being made up
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   of the people buying that company's stock.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And the company that has a strong stock price,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   that's a major component of the success of the company.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   The chairman, the board of directors,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   all of the key executives,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   they all want and need the company to have a strong stock price
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   in order for their personal compensation to flourish
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   and in order for the company to flourish.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And so the fact that you went out on the independent market
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   and you paid what was asked in order to settle a stock trade
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   is a vote of confidence in that company.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And if the demand for a company's share prices went down,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   that company would undergo significant changes
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   in its plans, in its approach, in its system, etc.,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   until its share price were to recover.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   So it is still, even though the money is not directly there,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   as I see it, it is still a vote for that company
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   when you purchase that company's stock.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   This is what's so interesting about the modern world, though,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   is that very few people ever go out
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and make a direct investment into a company.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   We're living in a world where it's not you and me as individuals
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   who are going to make the difference.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It's much more a world where it's a small number of investors,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   they might be activist investors, institutional investors,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   they can put pressure on a company,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and the company is much more focused on not making--
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   with the general public, they're more focused on
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   not having a bad reputation develop
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   versus being focused on making a splash
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and attracting individual investors.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   The only comment I would close with is simply this.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   It's very difficult to be ideologically pure,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   and I think that it's probably something that's best avoided.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   You don't want to hurt your conscience
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   by being involved in things that you think are wrong,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   and so that's something that's best avoided.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   But we're living in a world that is so complex
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   with so many points of compromise
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   that it's very, very difficult, and I would say
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   almost impossible to be ideologically pure.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   So I would say at its core,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   I don't want to be a weasel and back out
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   of personal responsibility with your money.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   That's not my goal.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   But at its core, I think you're better put
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   in a situation where you say,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   "Where can I actually make a difference?"
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   And I don't think that your Roth IRA with $15,000 in it
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   is going to make a big difference
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   with regard to what you choose to invest it into
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   or choose not to invest it into.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Now, if you've got a portfolio of $30 million
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   that you're managing, and you're going to go out
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   and purchase individual companies,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   now I think you need to be more careful of that.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   But there are a lot of people who can--
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I'm sitting here, we're doing this call over an iPhone.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   An iPhone is made with slave labor in China.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   So how am I best served?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Am I best served by saying that I'm going to avoid
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   buying this iPhone, which is made with slave labor in China
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and manufactured there,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and not only is the company run by a bunch of people
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   that do things that I don't agree with,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   but the actual products themselves are from a country
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   that is committing genocide against religious minorities?
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   All that is absolutely true.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   But what's going to best serve me?
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I don't want to weasel out and not confront the reality
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   of this device sitting here in my hand.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   I want to be very clear about it,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and I want to be effective.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And so we're all going to make compromises.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   I choose to make a compromise and say that I'm going to use this device,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   and I'm going to try to be effective
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   and encourage people to think about righteousness in their living
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   and righteousness in their investing,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   but I'm aware of the fact that it is a compromise.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   So you're going to have to let your conscience guide you.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I've just seen people on either extreme,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   some people who just never pay attention to it,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   and say, "I'm going to go and make as much money as I can
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   from things that are harming people,"
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   which I think is wrong, absolutely wrong.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   But on the other hand, being a purist,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   I think can dramatically limit your effectiveness.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   So you'll have to find where that line,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   the appropriate line is for you.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   We go to 217 Aerial Code.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Hi Joshua, excited to be speaking with you today.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I had listened to your show recently.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   It was back in December,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   and it really just resonated with me where you had talked about,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   you know, just creating memories with your children
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   and that they won't need your money when you're 90
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   and just really being conscious of spending your money
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   when it most counts for your children,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   and I really appreciated that show.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   But I also wanted to kind of pick your brain a little bit,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   given our current situation,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   which is we have a little one that may need that money
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   when we're older,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and we need some additional support as an adult.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   So do you think that you would be doing things differently
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   if you were in that situation,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   and if so, what do you think you would be doing differently?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Absolutely.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   I think that if you are--
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   so whenever someone like me is talking about a subject,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   you need to always try to understand the perspective
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   that I'm talking from,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and then ask yourself,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   "Does this apply to my situation or not?"
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   So with my comments, for example,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   about don't wait until you're old to give your children money
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   because they're probably old too,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   I'm talking about a stereotyped situation
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   in which mom and dad pile up all this money,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   all this money, all this money.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   They don't give it to their children.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   They don't do anything with it,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and then they die with millions of dollars in the bank,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   and the children get it,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   and great, mom and dad gave us this money, big deal.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And my comments are based upon saying,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   "Hey, this is more effective if you invest it in a different way."
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   You can invest it into your children, in their education.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   You invest it into memories.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   You give it to them at a young age
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   and give them a house when they're 30
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   rather than when they're 70 and they don't need it.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   But that doesn't apply to someone like you
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   if you have a child who has special needs.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   If you have a child who is going to be limited
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   in his or her capacity,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   then that changes things very, very dramatically.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   And now you're in a situation
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   where you're looking at a child and saying,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   "This child is going to need more substantial help,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   and so how do I make sure that that help is there?"
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Now, some things are certainly true,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   meaning that I sometimes wonder.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   I would not want to judge somebody.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   I would just simply wonder.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   I sometimes wonder if in our hyper-financialized world
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   we make the same mistake with people who have special needs
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   as we do with people who don't have special needs,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   meaning that we try to solve certain things with money
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   that are better served in other ways.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   And so we try to say,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   "I'm going to--we first think about setting up a special needs trust
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   before we think about spending all the money now
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   in hopes of finding a solution to the specific problem."
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   I wonder about that,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   but I think that that's probably not my place to say.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   But I would always ask,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   "Is there a way that you could spend the money?"
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   because a special needs trust is a not very good solution
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   if that same thing--if that same money could be invested
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   in a way that would minimize the particular impact of the need.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I also think that sometimes money and financial--
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   that things are financialized when they shouldn't be.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   And so you might say, "Hey, instead of going through
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   a long, complicated legal planning and financial instruments
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   in a special needs trust,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   let's see if we can build a family culture
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   where we can look out for this particular family member
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   who's going to need extra help, extra needs, etc."
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And so the human element is, I think,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   an element that is often under-discussed in financial circles
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   because we are very accustomed to professionalizing everything.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   However, that said, I think you still have a duty
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   and an obligation to do the very best that you can
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   towards your child.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   And if your child needs help, that means
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I need to support my child now when my child is young,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   and I need to make the appropriate financial planning moves
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   so that there is support there even into perpetuity,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   even to make sure that after I'm dead and gone,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   my child is still taken care of.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   So it absolutely does not apply with those caveats.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   I'm not talking to someone in your situation,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   and I think that if you have a child who seems like
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   that child is going to need extra support, extra care,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   extra financial support because of limited capacity in some way,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   then yes, you owe it to your children to make sure
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   that you engage in that long-term planning.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Great. Thank you.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   I don't know if that didn't sound offensive in any way.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I just really appreciate your outlook on things,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   and it helps me just kind of see that it is okay
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   to spend some of that money now.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   It's okay to create those memories now,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   but I just always have that thought in the back of my head
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   that I just need to continue saving and continue saving.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   So it's good to know that you can do both.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Right. Yeah, and finding that line,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   kind of like the previous call,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   finding the line where you can sleep well at night
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   is probably a very individualized thing.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   You don't want to--as a parent, right,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   you're always balancing competing ideas.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   If you have more than one child,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   any moment spent with one child is a moment not spent
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   with the other child.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   And so trying to find that balance is difficult.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   I'm really conscious of the fact that it's much easier for us
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   to spend all of our time and attention on our children
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   who misbehave as compared to spending our time
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   and attention on our children who are better behaved.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   It's so easy to ignore the child who is polite and kind
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   and obedient and spend more time with your problem child
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   instead of rewarding the good behavior in some way.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   And so kind of the same challenge comes to money.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   How much should go into a long-term investment account
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   versus how much should go into creating family memories now?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   And I don't have the answer to those things
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   other than to say that you will--
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   just the fact that you are consciously asking the question,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   thinking about the challenge, et cetera,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   means that you'll find the appropriate way through it
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   for your family.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   - All right, thank you so much. - My pleasure.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   We go on to Catherine.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Catherine, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   [silence]
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Catherine, you're up.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   [silence]
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   All right, we'll come back to you, Catherine,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   - and we'll go on to Joseph. - Hello.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Joseph, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Hey, this is Joseph. Can you hear me?
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   Sounds good. Go ahead, sir.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   [silence]
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Yeah, so my wife, Catherine,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   spoke with you a couple weeks ago
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   about our family dynamics
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   with e-readers and language,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   and then you did the--
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   you followed up this week, I guess,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   on the whole language acquisition topic.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   And so my question is--
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   I'm kind of the tech in the house,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   and I wanted to better understand
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   your workflow from a digital perspective.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   You know, downloading this, downloading that,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   ripping it here, bringing it into there,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   you know, just kind of the nuts and bolts of that
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   so that I can start a year kind of challenge
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   with our kids and e-reader and input methods.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Okay. Well, I guess we will get a little bit technical here,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   - but to begin with-- - Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   I was like, "Is there any way I can email you
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   - and we can-- - It's okay. It's okay.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   We'll talk it through.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   So to begin with,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   you're a homeschooling family,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   you're a literature-based family,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   and I would assume-- and I understand and remember
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   from the previous call that at the moment,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   most of your children's reading is done on the page,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   on the written page. Is that right?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   - Yes, all of it. - Okay.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   So I don't think that there's any downside to that,
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   and I don't think that it's technically necessary
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   for you to use an e-reader of some kind
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   in order to have good results.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   We were pretty hardcore about no devices,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   and again, I'm not saying that's the best thing.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   We just had chosen to be hardcore for a variety of reasons.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   But when we were going to travel full-time,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   obviously the challenge of traveling full-time
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   is how many suitcases are you going to dedicate to books?
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   We wound up dedicating a suitcase to books,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   but we weren't willing to do more than that,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   and so we decided that it was time to go ahead
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   and start to use a digital reader.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   And I think that when we look at modern reading technology
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   straightforwardly, there are actually many benefits
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   to a high-quality e-reader,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   things that it provides that the written traditional page
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   does not.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   So what we chose, first of all, is that we didn't want to have--
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   we wanted a reading device, not a tablet.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   We didn't want games.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   We didn't want colors.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   We didn't want anything.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   We didn't want web browsing.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   We just wanted a reading device.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And so thankfully, there's a really wonderful reading device
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   called the Amazon Kindle, the original Kindle,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Kindle Paperwhite, et cetera.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   And these things are awesome.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   They're fantastic in terms of how effective they are.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I think that that's the natural obvious choice
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   is simply to use an Amazon Kindle.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   And if you use an Amazon Kindle,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   you will stay in the Amazon ecosphere.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   The benefit of that is you have the best selection
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   of any ecosphere out there of books.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   And so all of the books are available to you.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   And that's really, really powerful
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   because depending on what you're trying to get to,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   the books that you'll put on there will vary.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   So what we have used it for is at this point in time,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   virtually all public domain books are available
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   as a Kindle e-book.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   So you can use public domain books
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   in a really wonderful way.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   I also really love that there's tons and tons of bundles
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   and collections that are available on Amazon ready to go.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   So for example, I mentioned in the conversation
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   with your wife, I mentioned that I've got
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   the original Tom Swift series, right?
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   The classic books written in the early 1900s.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And I paid 99 cents and somebody gave the whole collection.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   And it's awesome because you can pay 99 cents,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   you get the whole collection,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   and it's right there on the book.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   And all of the old public domain books
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   have been basically put into collections
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   and you can find them and put them on your device.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   And that's really, really powerful.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   But-- - Can I--
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   - Go ahead.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   - You mind if I jump in and take it kind of back
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   to the technical piece of it?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   So I love the idea of having access to the dictionary,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   you know, or to define the words for vocabulary purposes.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Now, what--so I like that about the Kindle.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   What I'm hoping to be able to do is find a solution
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   that I can still have that type of screen
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   without all the mess, you know,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   so I don't have to buy an iPad for this purpose,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   but be able to use some of the platforms like Hoopla,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   for instance, is one of the free provided pieces of software
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   that the library has access to.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And we have, you know, tons of titles there.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   And I was--I'm hoping to find a way
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   to take these different formats
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that are formatted for specific places
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   and either convert those or break them down
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   into a way that I can bring them into another e-reader
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   if that's possible, you know, like--
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   so this app, Hoopla, if I was to grab that book
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   and then export it into a form
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   that I could bring it into a Kindle,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   that would be cool, but I don't know
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   if that's open source enough to do something like that.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   - It's not. It won't.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   So if that's important to you,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   then the Amazon ecosystem is not gonna be your best bet.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Amazon formerly was a little bit more friendly.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I have for years purchased Amazon books, Kindle books.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   I for years was able to get
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   all the digital rights management software stripped off,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   and I--all the books that I bought,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   I emptied my entire Amazon Kindle account out,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   and I keep them all on my computer
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   as independent files outside of the Amazon ecosystem.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   You can use a Kindle device to put books onto if you own them,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   but what you can't do at this point in time
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   is you cannot get the--
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   at least any way that I have found
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   when I've researched it in the past year,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   starting about a year ago,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   I could not get Amazon books and get the DRM off
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   so that I could store them on my actual device.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   So if that's important to you,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   I would encourage you to go away from Amazon Kindle.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   What you-- - So is there an option?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   - Yeah. So if that's important to you,
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I would say that you should look at one of the other devices.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   So all of the e-readers, most--
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   at least--I don't know about all of them,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   but most of them will probably work similarly to the Amazon Kindle,
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   and they'll all work with Hoopla,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   but you won't have--
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   I don't think you'll have an easy time
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   getting your Hoopla books out into your personal collection.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   That's going to be difficult,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   and Hoopla works very hard to keep that from happening.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   I-- - But you're saying I would be able to access them
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   from, like, the Kobo, for instance?
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   - You can access them from any e-reader, yes.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   So all the e-readers are going to have a plug-in
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   to either OverDrive or Hoopla
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   where you put in your account,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   and you can borrow them directly from those platforms.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   It's just simply if you're trying to get them off of the device
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   and onto your own computer,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   you're not going to be able to do that from Hoopla very easily.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   So-- - Okay.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   So you're saying even the Kindle can access Hoopla?
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   - Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   And what I'd say is that your Kindle--
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   if you're just going to be reading them from the library,
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Kindle's going to be your best option
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   because every library platform--
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Hoopla, OverDrive, whatever the next one is--
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   they're going to be fully integrated with the Amazon Kindle,
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   and they have a seamless borrowing system.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   So I think that the Kindle is--
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   the Kindle is the standard,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   and so it's a really great option for you.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   - Okay, so then the other piece is the audiobooks--
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   I mean, yeah, the audiobooks itself
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   that you research and you add to the mix
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   to narrate while you read.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   - So once again here, I think the winner is Kindle
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   because Kindle has the WhisperSync integration.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   So if you own the Audible audiobook from audible.com
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   and you own the Kindle book,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   then the integration--
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   you can make the integration of those two things seamless.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   And the Kindle device, the e-reader device,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   will read to you from the specific text
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   with a good narrator, et cetera.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   And so the strength is on the actual Kindle brand again.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   So we can get more complicated.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Like what I do is I do all of my reading
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   in a totally different system called LingQ, L-I-N-G-Q.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   That is not something that works on the actual Kindle e-reader.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   That's an iPad application, iPhone,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   or computer-based application.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I don't think it's necessary for children,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   and that's why I didn't recommend it.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   So I use some different systems.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   But if you're talking about for children,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   I think the best thing is either have two devices,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   have one device that you're going to read the book on
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   and the other device that you're going to use
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   for playing the audiobook,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   or go ahead and just stick with Amazon Kindle.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   I think the strength is really just on sticking
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   with Amazon Kindle as your platform
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   because then you can buy the books that are available.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   They're not going to--
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   you can get the version that you want.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   You can get them synced up with Audible,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   and you can get the same book on Audible.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   It's really probably the best solution to go with.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   It's annoying because you never own it, right?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   You're forever renting it.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   You're paying these fees to--
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   you pay these fees to Amazon and to Audible,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   and you have a rental payment for--
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   a one-time rental payment for something
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   that you can never actually own.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   So that's really, really annoying,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   but it's cheaper than--
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   it's cheaper than a full-time language tutor.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   You got to just invest into the actual end result.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   And then how do you manage them from your--
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   let's take the children aside
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   because my wife and I,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   we need to acquire some better language skills
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   before we get to--
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   I mean, before--
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   in the process, we need to do that.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   So looking at LingQ or something along those lines,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   do you then just manage all the content
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   from your home server, or what do you--
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   how do you--
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   I guess it would be great to see, like,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   a digital workflow, like, a mind map of your--
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   - Right.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   - --of your tech setup--
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   - It's pretty simple.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   - --in a way that--
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   - Yeah, it's pretty simple.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   So I keep them separate, totally separate.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   My children's stuff is not integrated
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   with my stuff in any way.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   So I have a device,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   and you may have to have a device
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   that you're going to use,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   and this is going to be the children's e-reader
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   or this child's e-reader.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   The Amazon system has a really good system
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   of parental controls,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   and with a Kindle device,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   you're just dealing with reading books.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   And so they have parents.amazon.com.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   You go on there.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   You authorize--you set up an account,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   a profile for the individual child,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   and then you just have a system of toggle switches
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   that you can add or add content
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   or take content off of the device very easily
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   based upon what has been purchased
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   in the Amazon account.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   So you can just add whatever content you want
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   onto the device very simply.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   And then similarly with a separate Audible profile
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   if you're using audio books there.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   And audio books, by the way, same thing.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   You can get a lot of those from Hoopla.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Some of those from Hoopla or Overdrive
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   or your local library system as well.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   I think that Link is more than what's necessary
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   for most children.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   I really love the power of Link.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   If I were coaching a high school-age student,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   I would encourage the use of Link.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   But I think that for young children,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   it's unnecessarily complicated,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   and I haven't seen any benefit of trying to use it.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   So for me, then what I do is I use Link.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Now Link has lots of content,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   and the whole system of the Link app
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   is something that you can use any digital content
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   that you own, you can upload into it.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   So you can bring stuff in from webpages,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   you can bring stuff in from any file
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   that you have on your computer,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   any book that you have, you can bring it into it.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   So what I do is I purchase my e-books
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   from a site that I can eventually strip the DRM off
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   and get either an EPUB file or a text file
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   or whatever it is that I have,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   and then I just upload my books into Link
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   as standalone books.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   And depending on what language you're looking for,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   you can find lots and lots of books
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   that are in the public domain,
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   or you can find lots of books
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   where you can get the full file
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   and you can just load those on as well.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   So that's a separate system.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Link works really beautifully on an iPad.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   That's where I usually use it,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   but I wouldn't go and buy an iPad just for it.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   They also have a really great web browser system as well,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   so you can use that for your own reading.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Okay, and that was,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   so where do you find that content from
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   that you're able to--
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   I'm not willing to--
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   What language are you going to be studying?
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   We're starting with Spanish.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   All right.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   So with Spanish, I would say
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   one of your best websites would be
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   lelibros.online,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   L-E-L-I-B-R-O-S dot online.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   That's a website I always point Spanish speakers to.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   I don't understand how they have their rights,
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   but they have hundreds of books
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   that are available totally for free.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   With no DRM in Spanish,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   available on that website.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   And you can find something there
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   that will interest you.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   For you personally as an adult,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   they have lots of novels.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   They have lots of stuff there.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   And then beyond that,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   it's kind of a constant hobby
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   is that as a language learner,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   your number one problem
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   is finding content that is accessible to you
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   and that you're interested in.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   That's your number one thing.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   If you could find the content,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   everything works,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   but that's part of the hunt.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   And so your content is going to be different
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   from your children's content.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   You just got to go out and find something
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   that you're interested in and get it.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   So there's lots of stuff available for free online.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   If you're the tech guy in the household,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   you should be good enough
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   at finding the files that you want
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   or you can use one of the solutions
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   and purchase your stuff on a platform
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   that you can hack in some way,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   apply a software program, etc.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   to be able to get the DRM stripped off
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   so you can have a DRM-free file
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   that you can upload into LingQ.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   But that's the classic challenge that we all face
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   is finding our content that we want.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Sure, sure.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   Okay, so last thing is,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   let's just say I download some content
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   from Lead Libros
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   and then am I able to
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   bring that straight into a Kobo
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   or which e-reader is the one
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   which I can use to import in that stuff that I pull?
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   So with that,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   man, we are getting really technical in the weeds.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   You weren't lying about we're going to get into it.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   I'm sorry, man.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   So I think what you want to use for that
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   is you want to use,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   the king of the hill here
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   is the software application called Calibre.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   C-A-L-I-B-R-E, Calibre.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   Calibre is a technical,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   is an open source program
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   that is meant for managing an e-book library.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   So what you can do is,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   if you use Calibre,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   you can have your device
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   and then what Calibre will allow you to do
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   is you can plug your,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   it'll allow you to organize all of your files
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   in the Calibre software
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   and then you can plug in your device
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   and you can just send files to your e-reader.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   And so that'll work with just about any device
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   that you actually want.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   So that's also a good solution.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   - Okay.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   That's super helpful, man.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   I appreciate it.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   - Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   It's, there's all,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   the reason I haven't just said,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   here, do all my things
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   is that I think that you want a straightforward system.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   A straightforward system that works
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   is better than kind of a wacky,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   put together, cobbled together system.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   I really think the best solution
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   is just an Amazon Kindle and an Audible account.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   I really think that's your best solution.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   - Yeah, I hear you,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   especially for the kids.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   I'm kind of wacky
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   and I've got a pretty extensive IT,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   wacky mind.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   So I need to piece together things.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   And yeah, so that was super helpful.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   I'll figure it out
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   and we'll keep you up to date
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   on this journey. - My pleasure.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   My pleasure.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And in closing, I would say that,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   like I mentioned to Catherine,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   I haven't observed any downsides
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   to this particular system
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   and I think that there are upsides to it.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   I think that as a bone,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   for your homeschooling,
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   I think that using the,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   using a good E-device,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   an E-reader in your homeschool
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   is I think a powerful, powerful solution.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   And here are a couple of advantages of it.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   Number one, if you go through
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   and you look at what's available
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   in the public domain marketplace,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   there are so many books available
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   that you just cannot get the reprints for.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   And every year, more of them come on.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   For example, like the classic,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   I'll just use the example I already gave you,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   Tom Swift.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   Tom Swift is such a powerful set of books
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   for a child to read.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   And the original ones written in the early 1900s
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   are fantastic.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   They have rich language.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   They're very well written.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   The ideas are big.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   In fact, you can trace all kinds of modern inventions
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   back to the original Tom Swift books.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   But they are not easy to find.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   You can't find them.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   I've bought a lot of old, used books in series,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   but I can't find them.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   And a lot of times when you go
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   and you're trying to search for Tom Swift,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   you're getting more of the modern reprints,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   which may not be exactly what you're looking for.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   And so if you want the originals,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   the best thing to do is just simply
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   to get them with a classic file.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   So for 99 cents that you pay to the guy
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   who put together the collection on Amazon,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   you have the whole library right there.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   And it's fantastic to have it.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   In addition, I think that the e-reader system,
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Amazon has their, I think they call it WordlyWise.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   They have a system where many books,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   they will put in synonyms and dictionary definitions
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   for various words while you're actually reading.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   And then you also have the system
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   where you can tap the word, add it to your,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   look it up in the dictionary.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   That's powerful.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   When I was a kid,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   I hated looking up words in the dictionary,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   so I never did it.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   But to the ability to tap the screen
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   when there's a word you don't understand,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   have a dictionary built in,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   tells you what that word means,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   even just in your native language reading,
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   is really, really good.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   Really awesome scenario.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   And then you can have access
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   to a much more interesting set of books
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   that allows your reader sometimes
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   to read based upon interest.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   For example, I was watching my son,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   and yesterday he was reading on his Kindle,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   and I asked him, I was like, "What are you reading?"
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   And he was reading a biography
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   that I have on there of General Grant,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Ulysses S. Grant.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   And it was one of the books that I had put on him,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   but I hadn't assigned it to him.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   But he just got interested in the biography,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   and I went and checked his reading history,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   and sure enough, he'd read 90 minutes
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   of this biography of General Grant.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   And what I have observed,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   one of the things that I learned from watching it,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   is that by having a more diverse set of books
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   on there available,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   that his reading wound up being more diverse.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   So instead of just reading the two or three books
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   that he would carry around with him
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   when it was physical books,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   now he would go more among different genres,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   change different things,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   read things that I didn't think
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   he would actually be interested in,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   but yet he wound up still being interested in them.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   So I think it's a benefit and something worth having,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   rather than a negative thing in any way.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   - I appreciate that.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   - Yep, my pleasure.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   All right, we go on to,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   well, Catherine was on there,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   but I think she's, we don't need to talk to her,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   we talk to Joseph,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   and we go to 813.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   - Hey Joshua, how are you?
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   - I am well, how are you, sir?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   - I'm doing well.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   I had called back, I guess a couple of weeks back,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   and I'm talking about my daughter,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   who was two years old,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   and having problems with the speech.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   And I just saw today
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   that the CDC has changed the age limit of 50 words.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   - I saw that as well.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   - To 50 by, was it 30 months?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   And that never really made the news.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   But I thought that was very, very strange.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   - I did, and what was interesting is I--
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   - I wanted to know your opinion on that.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   - I heard from a couple of listeners on Twitter
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   after you called into the Friday show
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   saying that they had had a similar experience
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   with their children.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   - Really?
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   - Yeah, I started to look into it,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   'cause as I mentioned to you on that live show,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   I had kind of, I didn't, I wasn't that skeptical.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   I just never really got into the mask debates.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   I never bothered, I just kind of,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   I figured, eh, not that big of a deal, et cetera.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   I didn't get into the mask debates all that much.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   And so when you were calling in
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   and talking about the impact that it had
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   on your daughter's development,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   I started reading about it a little bit more.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   And especially for young children,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   I think that absolutely it's harmful to young children.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   I had never, I just hadn't thought about it previously.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   And so the idea that children who gain all of their cues
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   from someone's face and they're attracted
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   from a very young age from babies
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   of being attracted to somebody's face,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   absolutely it makes all the sense in the world
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   that that would be more damaging to children.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   And so I was wrong.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   I just hadn't bothered to dig into it much,
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   'cause I didn't have any reason to.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   But now I definitely see that, yes, it is an impact.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   And so I saw that story this morning of the CDC changing.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   And so for context, previously the CDC had said
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   as a normal benchmark, your child by the age of 24 months
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   should be able to produce about 50 words
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   by the age of 24 months.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   But the argument is that they've now changed it
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   and instead of it being 24 months,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   they've said by 30 months,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   your child should be able to produce about 50 words.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   And so the argument is this is something
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   that they're just changing the rules.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   Now, I'm still, I'm personally a little skeptical
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   that that's all there is, right?
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   I don't know without actually going back
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   and doing some deep investigation
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   into the CDC's recommendations
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   and where did this chart come from, et cetera.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   But I definitely know that masks for children
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   are a bad deal or a bad idea in every way.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   So I'm sold on that.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   I don't need to know any more than that.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   (laughing)
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   - The reason for my call today was,
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   I had listened to your show yesterday
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   about, was it yesterday or the day before,
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   about the Canadian--
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   - Finance system.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   - Limit on banks.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   And what's the easiest solution you found
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   to do an offshore account?
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   - Are you, where do you live?
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   Are you American?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   - Yes.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   - Okay, so the easiest solution for Americans is Canada.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   And obviously I'm fully aware of how ironic that is.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   To recommend a Canadian bank account
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   in light of what I said.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   But the answer for Canadians,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   the easiest solution is the United States.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   And for Americans, the answer is Canada.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   I don't expect, I think that the Canadian debacle
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   is a very good example of how they will change the rules.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   And everything that I said.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   But I don't think that that is in and of itself
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   says that why on a widespread basis,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   Canada is not a reasonable solution
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   for people who want to open an offshore bank account.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   And for Americans, definitely Canada is the simplest
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   and most accessible option.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   Which gives me kind of a layup to address something
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   that a listener mentioned earlier today,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   also in response to that show.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   When you look at an offshore bank account,
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   you have to ask yourself the question,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   why am I actually opening this account?
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   What am I trying to get out of it?
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   And there are some things that are just off the table.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   For example, I don't try to talk to people
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   about opening a bank account for privacy reasons.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   Or at least privacy from government actors.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   The US government knows about all of my offshore bank accounts
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   because every single year I file a form
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   and I tell them exactly where all of my bank accounts are.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   So there's no privacy from the government.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   There's no tax savings.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   We're not engaging in tax fraud or tax evasion.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   That world is dead and gone.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   There was a time 30 years ago
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   where you could probably get away with it.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   You could go and you could open an offshore account.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   You could have gains in that account.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   You could not report those gains
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   and you could get away with it.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   But those days I think are dead and gone.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   So that's not the reason.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   My answer as to why should someone have an offshore bank account
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   is a few things.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   Number one, I think the most sensible thing
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   is to recognize that there are certain threats that you face
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   that are national in scope.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   So a threat like, hey, the government is saying
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   that if I have a GoFundMe or a GiveSendGo contribution
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   in my bank account to the trucker convoy,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   they're going to shut me down.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   What is happening in Canada is that bad.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   It is just that bad that if you made a contribution
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   via GoFundMe or GiveSendGo to the trucker convoy,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   then they can come in and they can say,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   oh, we're going to freeze your account.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   I don't think that they will do that
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   because although I don't think that the people who are involved
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   actually have any moral qualms about being tyrants,
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   they love it.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   They love controlling people's lives.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   They don't have any moral qualms about being tyrants.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   But there is still a culture that would push back more
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   if they affect too many people.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   So the way that what they do is they pick on a few people.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   And as long as you can get just a few people,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   most people will never lift their hands
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   to defend a small minority of people.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   It's just not worth their time.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   They're not going to get into it.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   So I don't think that they're going to shut down everyone
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   who made a GiveSendGo contribution, but they could.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   I don't think that banks are going to go
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   and try to shut down all those accounts, but they could.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   And so my point was they could, they can,
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   and they do it really, really fast.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   So if you have an account that's outside of the jurisdiction
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   that you're living in every day,
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   that account is harder to regulate
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   than an account that's inside the jurisdiction.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   Canadian banks are very, very heavily regulated
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   by the Canadian government.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   And so they will not do anything
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   that could interrupt their profit flow.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   They're not going to stand up
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   and try to defy the government in any way.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   They're going to do whatever the government says.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   Now, if your money as a Canadian
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   is just simply in Bank of America,
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   if you're a big enough target,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   then the Canadian government can get to you, right?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   They can go to the US government.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   They can open up a line
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   of international diplomatic communication.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   They can make an argument as to why your funds
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   in the United States should be frozen.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   And if you're a big target, then they can win.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   They will win that particular opportunity.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   But what they won't be able to do
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   is just do a widespread sweeping command
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   like they can do in Canada.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   And so the same thing for the United States, right?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   The United States is vastly bigger than Canada,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   a country of 10 times as many people,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   and although not geographically bigger,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   10 times as many people, so much more complex society.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   But the same thing has for the United States,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   that if you have $5,000 in a Canadian bank account,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   then you can know that,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   "Hey, at least I've got a little bit of money
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   that's not subject to the same scrutiny
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   or the same easy access
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   as if it is all in the United States."
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   Usually, this is not a problem, right?
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Because usually there's a system of court checks and balances.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   In the United States, you have much more,
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   evidently, much more rigorous protection of your money
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   than in Canada,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   because you have to get an actual court order,
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   you have to go through the process with judicial oversight.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   That's what was so awful about what the Canadian government did
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   is that for bouncy councils and trucks in the street,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   they swept their hands and they waived all of that.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   They used what was formerly the War Measures Act
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   over this minor domestic disturbance.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   So to my point is,
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   I see an account like that as primarily functioning.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Yes, maybe it's your $5,000 of money
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   that's in another place,
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   but primarily it's a safety valve.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   And the way I've talked about it is that,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   let's say that something happens
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   and you decide, "I want to get my money out of U.S. dollars."
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   Well, the fact that you already have the Canadian account established
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   allows you to make a transfer of your real assets
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   later down the road.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   And you can move your $100,000 savings account into Canada,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   get into Canadian dollars, etc.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   My big fear is not a political protest.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   My fear is currency controls.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   Because what happens is they always implement currency controls
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   when they run into a crisis of some kind.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   And so I don't want my money stuck behind a system of currency controls
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   where they can just destroy the value of the money.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   But now that's different
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   than if you really have more significant assets
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   that you want to move offshore.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   And so I think that there are very good reasons
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   for you to move significant assets offshore.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   But then I wouldn't recommend Canada as a first step.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   If you've got a million dollars, you don't go to Canada.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   You go to Switzerland or you go to Singapore.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   You don't go to Canada.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   And I do think that, obviously,
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   the benefit of Canada for Americans, in conclusion,
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   is simply it works just like what you're accustomed to.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   And so you drive to Canada.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   That's a big hurdle for many people,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   is to go somewhere they can drive.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   They speak the language that you speak every day.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   Everything looks and works and functions just like you're used to.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   It's a little different in Mexico.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   I don't like Mexico at all as a banking destination.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   So my answer is Canada.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   That's why.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   Even with all of these issues.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   Now, it shouldn't stop in Canada.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   And I wouldn't put major money in Canada, although you could.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   But I think that if you're dealing with major money,
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   with an actual sizable account,
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   then it's much more in your best interest
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   to go to a more robust banking jurisdiction than Canada.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   Okay.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   I appreciate that.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   And if you've got time for one more, that'd be awesome.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   Sure, go ahead.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   And moving some cash into commodities.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   Gold, silver.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   Right now.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   What would you say a percentage wise of, of, of cash.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   Should be put into.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   Into some alternative other than cash.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   Out of inflationary concerns.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   That's hard.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   Because I think that.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   So.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   That's a hard, hard question to answer.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   Because the answer is going to commit you to a prediction of what you think is actually going to happen.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   So if you thought, if you were sure that there was going to be 1000% inflation of your currency,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   and your currency is the US dollar, then you would, of course, the answer would be,
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   I would like to move as close to 100% out of cash as possible.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   Right.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   That would be, that would be sensible.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   But you're not sure that there's going to be 1000% inflation.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   And I would say it's exceedingly unlikely that there would be any, you know, 1000% inflation.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   Notwithstanding the last month's figures of 7.5% inflation.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   Inflation is significant right now.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   But I don't, I don't, I don't believe that the US dollar, I don't believe that the US dollar is going to turn into a hyperinflation currency.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   I could be wrong.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   I hope I'm not wrong.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   But I could be wrong.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   And I have a plan for it.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   But what I would say is your first solution would not be to say what percentage of my cash would go from cash to commodities.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   But rather to say what percentage of my cash should go from cash to a better run currency.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   And so I think that if you're genuinely concerned about inflation,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   that you're probably better off to think about what percentage of your cash reserves you want held in a competing currency.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   And so you can hold Canadian dollars, you can hold Swiss francs, you could hold Singapore dollars, you could hold pounds, you could hold euros.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   Any of those are good solutions.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   You're exposed to some risk of international currency fluctuation risks.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   But I think that's a more sensible way for you to protect against inflation than just buying commodities.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   My answer on the commodities question is more a matter of net worth rather than percentage of cash.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   And so I think that if you have somewhere 5% of your net worth in commodities, I think that that's probably a pretty good number.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   Maybe as high as 10%.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   Somewhere in that 5% to 10% range seems pretty good.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   And so I would look at it in terms of net worth.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   And then I would also say, is this going to be the best, most productive commodity for me to purchase?
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   So if you're trying to say a percentage of cash, I think your first answer is let's put some into a competing currency.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   Swiss francs, wonderful, right?
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   Again, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, New Zealand dollars, Singapore dollars, any of those are fine.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   And then answer the commodities question based upon a net worth question, not a percentage of cash.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   And I don't like to be – sometimes I wonder if I've gotten too wait and see.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   I just –
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   No, not at all.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   I don't – when I was younger, I was prone towards kind of catastrophism, thinking, oh, it's all going to happen so fast.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   But I don't think that's the case.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   And so – and then I guess the other thing that has really affected me is having watched and studied carefully.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   I've studied several, like, serious hyperinflations and watched very carefully over the last few years with what's happened in Venezuela.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   That I think that the answers are usually not gold coins.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   I think that the answer is a competing currency.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   And a competing currency – and the best thing is simply a currency that you can get into if you decide that that's right for the bulk of your assets.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   So I think the first thing is have an offshore bank account that will allow you to hold foreign currency and U.S. dollars.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   Then you can move your U.S. dollars out of the United States into a U.S. dollar account abroad.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   That should help you to bypass currency controls if or when they were actually imposed.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   And then the ability to take that money and go quickly into another foreign currency I think is sufficient.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   Because hyperinflation – inflation itself and hyperinflation is not necessarily contagious.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   You had high inflation rates in Canada recently reported and the United States.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   But I think that's due to the same underlying causes.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   And for my cash I'd rather own Swiss francs than a bunch of gold.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   Yes. Okay. Awesome.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   That's it. Anything else?
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   That's it.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   Good. Good stuff.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   My pleasure.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   And Catherine, are you there?
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   I didn't want to cut you short if you had your own question earlier.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   I tried to go to you and then evidently I think I spoke to your husband.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]   Are you there, Catherine?
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   Does that happen to be me?
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   I guess it is because you don't sound like a Catherine.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   No. Okay.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   That's all good. I just wanted to make sure.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   So that concludes – I finished all of the phone lines.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   That is it for today's Q&A call.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   Thank you all for the great questions.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   I've enjoyed them.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   As you can see, I'll take it even if we get into the technical question of what e-reader platform
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   and the details of international currency transfers, et cetera.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   I really appreciate it.
