[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and welcome to the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.040]   In this episode I have with me my wife, Sydney. How are you? Hi everybody, good morning. Good
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.160]   morning, good afternoon, good evening. In this episode we're going to talk about the right
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.120]   amount of money to give our adult children while we are alive and after we die. I've been thinking
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   about this topic more and more recently as our children grow older and older. I talked to other
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.640]   parents and try to hear their thoughts on the strategic planning. Then I see my neighbor who
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.200]   is now 30 years old and still living with his parents because his parents gave him everything.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.800]   He's got nice cars, he's got a motorbike and he hasn't left the house since spending six years in
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.080]   college for now six years now. So we've seen him since 2014 and he's still there living at home
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.120]   and that just kind of bums me out. I would think that every parent's hope is that their child
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.720]   launches, finds something they'd love to do in their career, finds something they love to do
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.680]   in their life and find love. I mean what are your thoughts? Right, I mean we have seen him. The only
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.800]   positive thing I will say is that it does seem like he has consistently gone to a job
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.120]   five days a week because he would start his motorbike up at eight o'clock every morning.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280]   We were awake but it would be kind of annoying to hear that noise. We don't know what job he's
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.680]   been to but at least he consistently seems to have some form of employment which is good for him.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.240]   I know what he does. I don't want to say anything but it's nothing like you're like wow you went to
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.720]   college for six years to do that. So come on folks this is a new era. People really have to think
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.280]   about how much they spend their time and money on education, what they want to do. Things are
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.520]   difficult now. Yeah. So I'm trying to come up with a framework on how much to give our children
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.160]   while living because before we had children I always thought man parents giving kids cars,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.040]   houses, you know stipends while they're already adults seems kind of weak. Weak sauce. But now
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.840]   as we're parents it seems like okay it's better to give our children money while we're alive. It
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   makes us feel better and it helps them when they need the money the most than after we're dead and
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.160]   when they're like 50 plus years old. What are your thoughts? I think it's a great idea to contribute
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   while we're alive versus only after death. Being able to do both is obviously great too.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.840]   Tell me about the conversation you had with your friend on the tennis court about this.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.360]   Well I just had I was just hitting with a friend and he's a very successful fund manager
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.920]   and he was saying well I should probably set up about 10 million dollars for my son
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.720]   because what if he just wants to be a college professor and make 150,000 a year.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.440]   Like that would be tough for his family to survive if his spouse or the son's spouse didn't work.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.120]   Oh wow that's that's quite aggressive. I mean that seems pretty aggressive but then if we talk about
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.240]   the 0.5 percent rule which I discussed and where there's so much backlash 10 million at 0.5 percent
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.800]   withdrawal rate is uh what is that 50,000 dollars because 10 percent of 10 million is 1 million 1
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.720]   percent of 10 million is 100,000 so yeah 50,000 dollars. So now that rates are so low right you
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.840]   know the file the goal post has moved so much hey maybe 10 million maybe that's a reasonable amount
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   because that's only generating 15,000 a year. If perhaps the son doesn't know it's that big.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.240]   Right because I think if if our kids knew that they were going to get 10 million dollars.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.480]   If anybody knew they were going to get 10 million dollars they wouldn't be motivated to.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   That's true but the funny thing is in 20 years 10 million dollars will maybe will be worth maybe
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.640]   six million dollars seven million dollars and that's kind of one of the fallacies of people
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.600]   saying oh I want to be a millionaire and make you know one million dollars or have a net worth of
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.160]   one million dollars. Back in 1945 if you're a millionaire that was big balling. Oh yeah the
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.840]   needle's always moving. And so now if you were to compound that one million just by the rate of
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.000]   inflation from 1945 to 2020 that million is worth more like 14 to 15 million. Yeah. But that's the
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.320]   thing so if you're gonna leave your kid 10 million dollars that that just seems out of control
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.000]   ridiculous. Well not very many people would even have the option or the right ability to leave that
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.640]   much. So we're kind of like maybe wasting time talking about this this level of income and wealth.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.920]   So let's talk about the right amount to give while living. I believe that we should follow
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.320]   kind of the tax guidelines and give the exclusion amount the gift tax exclusion amount. Yeah I think
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.520]   that makes a lot of sense. So for 2020 the gift tax exclusion amount is 15,000 a year. In other
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:30.080]   words every time you give 15,000 you lower your estate amount by 15,000 which means on the back
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.040]   end when you die you don't have to pay the death tax on 15,000 or any of that gift tax exclusion.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.640]   I think you made a good point in your post though that you don't want
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:50.080]   or I wouldn't want our kids to get dependent on expecting a set amount of money every single year.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.640]   So you had mentioned something about doing it every three years. Right so I think giving every
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.840]   three years the gift tax exclusion amount seems pretty good because if it's every year then it
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.760]   feels like income and then you just expect it right. And the gift tax exclusion amount is per
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   person so both of us can each give 15,000 to each child so 30,000 a year. So once you start giving
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:27.200]   30,000 a year that's a lot. It's like why bother working 30,000 especially if we give them you
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.000]   know a place to stay and all that you just why bother doing anything. Yeah it's too much. It's
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.720]   too much so if you want to give 30,000 I say you know you can give that maybe once every six years
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.320]   which is mathematically equivalent to giving 15,000 every three years. One thing I'm thinking
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.680]   about regarding the gift tax exclusion amount is since only one percent of people have an estate
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.240]   worth over 10 million dollars why are we even bothering with the gift tax exclusion amount.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:07.760]   Right like okay so if you die with five million which is still a lot of money you're still 6.58
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.880]   million away from the estate tax threshold to pay that 40% death tax so who really cares. I
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   don't understand why people are focusing so much on the gift tax. I guess maybe it's because they
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.280]   think that that amount won't last so long. It does have a deadline I forget what it is. It's
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.920]   still in the future but you know anything is possible it could get changed. That's true that's
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.840]   true good point like historically that estate tax threshold amount was down to like a million dollars
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:47.040]   just several years ago and of course it depends on the government laws and so forth. So that's true
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.920]   I mean to expect the estate tax threshold to continue going from 11.58 million per person
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.480]   you know to 12 to 13 to 20 I mean it's probably going to cap out at some point. Yeah. So good
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.320]   point. All right so beyond just giving the gift tax exclusion amount every three to six years
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.600]   the other big thing I've noticed at least here in San Francisco is that for first-time homebuyers
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.480]   I think it's like 60% I surveyed a lot of realtors 60% of first-time homebuyers have some type of
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:25.360]   help from their parents whether it's partial help or the full 10 or 20% down payment. What do you
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   think about that? I think adult kids who have parents who are able to help them afford their
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.440]   first home in an expensive city like San Francisco is a very fortunate thing. You know it's it's
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.680]   tough I think every set of parents has to look at their adult children individually and see how
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:50.400]   motivated they are you know how involved they are with the parents. Right. You know one thing the
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:00.640]   parents of the adult kids could do is have the adult kids contribute some sort of mortgage payment
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.200]   or I don't know make sure that they're involved somehow whether it's paying the property tax or
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.640]   taking their parents to the doctor you know just doing something to make sure they're not just
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:21.040]   receiving and not... Free riding? Free riding yeah there you go. So that is a good point in terms of
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.000]   being involved in the parents lives not like disappearing for five years or being a deadbeat
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.920]   after college and like hey mom and dad can I have some money? Right. You know forget that and some
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:41.040]   of the commenters did say well it might be more about timing instead of the amount given. So one
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.000]   parent was saying I think I'll know by the time my kid is in middle school or in high school
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.600]   whether he or she is on the ball empathetic sympathetic caring hardworking and knows the
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:01.120]   value of a dollar and if that kid does know all that stuff and has all those great attributes okay
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.160]   we're gonna adjust the giving amount accordingly as well as the time frame and if not it's like
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.400]   no wow why would we give our spoiled kid who doesn't listen who doesn't try hard anything
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.600]   but the irony on that and that is they might need more help because they don't listen. I know.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.680]   How do you figure that out? It's hard for parents especially who have multiple children with
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:31.360]   varying degrees of personalities and you know you know strong differences in personality because
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:38.080]   you don't want your one of your children to feel that they're you know left out or that they're
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.880]   overly favored but hey that's parenting that's no it's not easy. It's not easy and then a lot of
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.000]   parents have gone the default route and said we are going to divide our estate equally among our
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:59.200]   children but come on if you raise a very successful child who is financially independent by whatever
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   whatever age well what are you going to split the estate equally for but then on the flip side that
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.720]   you want to reward them right? It's like it's kind of like taxes it's like the harder you work the
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.640]   more you get taxed so why bother yeah that that is interesting and so you know I've talked to
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.440]   my parents and they said well we're just splitting it evenly it doesn't really matter how hard you
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.160]   work or whatever or how often you call me or it's just equal. Yeah my my parents had the same thing
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.520]   they they didn't want us to feel that they loved or cared for one of us more than the other.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:44.800]   What they actually felt who knows. Right we all secretly. I have heard some opinionated comments
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.880]   from my mom but I won't get about your family politics. Sibling. And you know I won't raise
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:58.000]   that on this podcast. Right. But yeah it's families can be very complex. Right and it it just is
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.160]   terrible how sometimes money can tear apart family relationships. Yes it definitely can it's
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:11.440]   unfortunate. It's terrible it's terrible terrible. All right Sam so tell me what your thoughts are
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.960]   on leaving a house to our kids or helping them out with down payment. So when I was in my 20s I had
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:26.000]   a lot of peers get gifted a house or a condo by their parents and frankly I was jealous you know
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.040]   one day they'd be like oh welcome to my housewarming party. It's a two bedroom you know two
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.600]   bathroom condominium on the Upper East Side. I was like what how do you afford seven hundred fifty
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:41.120]   thousand dollars on our very mediocre forty thousand dollar salary in Manhattan. And the
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:48.240]   answer is the parents either paid for the down payment or paid all cash for the place. And that
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:54.880]   was something that really got me motivated to try to maybe one day do that for my children.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.880]   And again this is over 20 years ago and also kind of fired me up to try harder just to save and
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:08.240]   invest more money. And I don't know if it's a good idea. On the one hand it's a reward. OK. They got
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.720]   a job at a really reputable firm at the time. And so the parents are like well we have excess money.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.400]   We're going to help you buy a place in Manhattan instead of spend on rent. Why not. And those
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.320]   apartments those condos have really appreciated in value since 1999 2000 they're up three X.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:33.760]   And so the rich got richer. They're winning. And so in the beginning I was definitely a little bit
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:41.040]   jealous. But over time I realized that actually makes a lot of sense especially if your kids are
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.360]   if our kids are going to end up in a big city that's more expensive than the median in the
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:53.600]   country. And if they can't buy a property for the age of 30. That's that's going to be tougher I
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   think. But that's also normal. Why should they have everything. So I don't know. It's tough for
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.280]   me to think about it. The way I'm thinking about right now is why not try to invest in real estate
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:11.680]   now. And then 20 to 30 years from now our kids will be like wow dad mom you bought real estate
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.840]   20 to 30 years ago for such a great price. Good job. Because think about all of us when we think
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:24.560]   man our grandparents could have bought property for what price 60 years ago. That's crazy. And
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.720]   the bottom line is it's inflation. Inflation is is too hard of a force to go against. So let me
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.960]   ask you this question. Let's say you did that and your child has one of these great properties in an
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.400]   expensive city. And then they decide that they're going to move and they're going to sell that
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:49.040]   house or that condo for a great profit. Yeah. Now what would you expect as the parent. Would you let
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.720]   them sell it. Would you not let them sell it. If they sold it would you expect them to return some
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.440]   of the money to you. What do you think about that. That's actually a good question. So I've been
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.480]   old holding it and paying property taxes and doing all that for 30 years and then they inherit it
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.680]   and they want to sell it a year later while I'm still alive. No. No. You're not going to do that.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:15.360]   You might. OK. If you want to do that you want to relinquish this property this great asset that
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.120]   generates awesome cash flow given it's been purchased 30 years ago and there's no mortgage
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   and all that. Well maybe you can get one 30th of the income or the equity. Maybe right. If
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.360]   if it's 30 years old maybe. But the point of these assets is to provide a perpetual income stream
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.800]   especially in a low interest rate environment. I'm not sure if people truly realize how much
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:50.080]   more valuable these income generating assets are. For example real estate income online income
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.720]   whatever asset you own that generates income has become much more valuable because interest rates
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.800]   and the risk free rate and so forth have declined so tremendously. Right. 0.5 percent or 0.7 percent
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.160]   on the 10 year bond yield. It doesn't yield that much income anymore. So if you actually have an
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.960]   asset that yields a much higher yield then it's much more valuable. But I think the market is not
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   not really recognizing that this therein lies the opportunity. So back to your question specifically
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.560]   again I think we also have to have a conversation. Have a conversation. Where are risk assets now
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.200]   where where's the risk free rate of return. You know what are your financial goals and so forth.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:39.280]   So maybe it's important that if you're going to gift or help your children with a house or any
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:45.280]   kind of property to consider who's on the title. Consider who's on the title. Yeah. So if it's on
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:51.440]   our title then ultimately it's our decision. So it's just kind of accounting. Well it's not
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:59.760]   accounting. It's here son daughter here's the house. But it's actually under my name so too
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   bad you can't do anything. You can enjoy it. You can manage it. You can earn the income. But if you
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.720]   want to you know try to sell it and rip it out. Yeah too bad. Too bad. OK. So once we've provided
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:22.080]   education some living subsidies maybe a down payment for a house maybe graduate school maybe
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.400]   I don't know. Is graduate school necessary in 20 years. I don't even know if college is really
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.360]   necessary in 20 years. Ultimately it depends on what career path you're going to take. Right.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.720]   Doctor dentist lawyer education is absolutely essential for those types of careers. You don't
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:54.160]   want to go to your doctor. I'm an expert. No no. Yeah that's not good. Yes. More education the
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.800]   better if we're talking about a doctor. Maybe. You know I got a good idea. Why don't we create
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:06.880]   a master's degree for personal finance blogging. Yeah that could be good right. Yeah. I mean come
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:14.240]   on money is very important. Very important but it doesn't seem like you need to have any kind of
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.040]   formal financial training to talk about money which is fine. You know we can just treat it
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.960]   as entertainment. Yeah. You make some money you lose some money you start all over in life.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:32.160]   That's fine. But anyway. OK. Back on topic. So tell me once we provide the basics education
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:40.800]   food clothing subsidized shelter should we provide even more money. I think you know we
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:46.080]   could help support the kids in different ways. Doesn't have to be actual dollars in their bank
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:54.880]   account or assets. One idea I thought about was taking a radical family vacation with the
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:01.520]   adult kids. You know it's hard to be involved with our. What do you think is funny. A radical. What
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:08.240]   do you say a radical family vacation. Well not just. What is a radical family vacation. I don't
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.680]   know. Just something adventurous that's not just you know going to the beach. Oh I love going to
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.760]   the beach. I know going to the beach. But I'm talking about like radical like skydiving. No.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   OK. More all inclusive fun vacation. That's really about bonding. So if let's say the global
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.760]   pandemic goes away and people aren't scared to travel anymore. So going to a new country
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.560]   together experiencing a new culture. Yeah. Something like that. You know where you takes
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:44.640]   a lot of planning and it costs a lot to go to Jordan or. Yeah. And it's as adults we're busy.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   It's hard to dedicate time to spend with our parents especially if they live far away. Right.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.680]   Yeah. So I really hope. Bringing them together. Pay for their flights. We're older and our kids
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.160]   are older that they'll want to be involved with us. And I think. Yeah. You know having a really
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.880]   fun vacation to look forward to. Yes. Would be a really cool way to have an experience together
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:18.560]   as a family and pay for it. OK. Or pay for a lot of it. The other idea is to help subsidize the
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   cost of grandkids. Yeah. So whether that's contributing to the 5 to 9 plan every year.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:31.280]   I think that's mainly it. Right. Contributing to their education fund. Yeah. That's something that
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:38.560]   you know 15000 a year 10. Whatever even 5000 dollars. Something is nice. And that's that's
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.000]   something that I think a lot of grandparents would enjoy doing. Right. So tell me your thoughts
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.800]   about giving money to children after. Well after we're dead it kind of doesn't really matter.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.680]   Hopefully we live long enough so that our kids are adults. They have their own families. They
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:03.120]   have their own money and so forth. So hopefully our kids are over the age of 50 when we die.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:10.080]   And so by that point I don't think our mannerisms the way we see money or spend money changes once
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.760]   we're 50 years old. I'm just think about I'm just think about my my parents. They're still super
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.600]   frugal. They don't have any debt. They've got a pension but they still go to early birth specials.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.280]   They still don't change the lamp fixture outside the house because they're afraid that once they
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.120]   change or they don't they don't turn the light on because they don't want to change the lamp
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.600]   fixture because the lamp fixture is a pain in the butt to change and also cost money. Right.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.760]   So I just think old habits die hard. So even if we leave our kids tens of millions of dollars when
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.240]   they're 50 plus if we raise them right if we've kept in touch with them they're going to do what's
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.800]   best I think for themselves and for society with the money we leave behind. Yeah. All right. That
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:00.240]   concludes this episode. If you enjoyed the episode we'd love a positive review and a rating. It keeps
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.040]   us going. We're gonna have more and more of these couple dialogues because I think it's just so fun
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.920]   to catch up and hopefully one day our kids will look back in August 2020 or September 2020 and be
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.440]   like Mom Dad what were you guys thinking. It'll be really fun. All right. Thanks so much everyone.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.960]   Talk to you later. Bye.
