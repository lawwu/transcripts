[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - So you're now living in the middle of nowhere
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.060]   in Tennessee, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.960]   You live on a mountain and you have a porch
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.420]   that faces out towards the mountains.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.380]   It sounds like a very serene and peaceful place.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.200]   In Minneapolis, you've lived for the past 30 years
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.760]   in a very loud, urban setting in a house
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.520]   that's set next to the interstate.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.900]   I mean, what has this adjustment been like
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.920]   from downtown Minneapolis
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.100]   to the middle of nowhere, Tennessee?
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.600]   - Well, it's taking some adjustment.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.020]   It's funny, the Lord prepared me for it in a way.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.960]   I came home in Minneapolis a few weeks ago
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.520]   and Mel-El and I got out of the car on a Saturday
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.760]   and we stopped and we said, "Something's wrong."
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   And what was wrong was that Interstate 94 and 35W,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.180]   which intersect in front of our house,
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.180]   had been shut down to build the bridge over Chicago Avenue
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.880]   and there was not a single car
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.040]   on these 15 lanes of freeway
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.680]   and the whole neighborhood sounded starkly silent.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.440]   And I stood there thinking, "This is really weird.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.880]   "I haven't heard this kind of silence for a long time."
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.980]   And that's the way it is here all the time.
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.920]   And so you sit on the front porch
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.100]   and there's nothing but this cow about a mile away,
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.300]   it seems like, I don't know what he's doing.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.220]   And then there's the birds that you can hear.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.400]   There are no cars anywhere.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   And so it is, I think, an adjustment of soul
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.280]   by which you get accustomed to the sounds of nature
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.300]   as opposed to the sounds of man.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.760]   And it remains yet to be seen to me
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.180]   what effect that's gonna have on my soul.
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.220]   I have no desire, Tony,
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.220]   to spend the last 10 years of my life
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.600]   sitting on a front porch staring at God's beauty
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.540]   because the world has fallen
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.220]   and I think God's gonna give me about a billion years
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.180]   sitting on a front porch staring at his beauty.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.620]   And his call on me now is to get retooled
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.620]   in a sweet place of peace and quiet, as I write,
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.360]   and fit me to throw my life back into the fray
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   of where most people in the world live
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.860]   with all of their sorrows.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.540]   And so I'm thankful for this year, really, really thankful.
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.160]   And maybe I can tune back in with you months ahead
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   and say, "Here's the effect that kind of silences head."
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.080]   I can give you one funny effect.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.620]   I can hear my wife breathing now,
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.240]   which can be good. - Of course.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.920]   - It can be bad because I'm used to having
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000]   just a nice hum of the freeway all night long,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.180]   kind of white sound.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.480]   And here, there is no white sound at all.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.680]   So every little move in the bed and every breath,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.440]   I'm alert to, so we'll see how that shakes out.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   - Wonderful.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.660]   We will check in with you in the future
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.900]   about the transition, Pastor John.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.800]   Thank you.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.520]   And thank you for listening to this podcast.
