[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   If you have your Bibles, please turn with me to Numbers chapter 20.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.800]   It's such an honor and a privilege to stand before you men.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.600]   We'll be looking at Numbers 20, 10 through 13.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.480]   Moses was really a man with no equal.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.400]   I mean, he was chosen from birth.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.280]   He was raised in Egypt's palace.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.200]   He was protected.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.720]   He defied Pharaoh, the greatest man on the planet at that time.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.160]   He worked amazing miracles, turning water to blood and then frogs and gnats and hail
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   and darkness.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.320]   He parts the Red Sea.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000]   He goes up on a mountain that the Israelites couldn't even touch and speaks to Yahweh face
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   to face as a man does with his friend.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.440]   When he comes down, his face is shining so brightly that the Israelites are terrified
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.440]   of him.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.720]   He lives a really remarkable, amazing life.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.160]   He's the first one to write a part of the Bible.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240]   He's a songwriter, too, and not just any song.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.680]   Talk about writing one of the greatest hits.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.080]   In the book of Revelation, John tells us that in heaven, those who conquered the beast were
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   singing what?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.000]   They were singing Moses' song.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.120]   Despite all of Moses' greatness, the Bible says that Moses was the humblest man on the
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   planet.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.600]   He was an exemplary leader, a type of the one to come.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.800]   He patiently bore the complaining, wicked Israelites time and time again.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.960]   Just days after leading them out of Egypt, they were already blaming him.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.640]   They were telling him, "I'd rather return and be a slave of Pharaoh than a servant of
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   Yahweh."
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.560]   You remember that because of that rebellion, God condemned the Israelites.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.200]   They would all die in the wilderness after 40 years of wandering, while another generation
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.240]   could be raised up.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.360]   Can you imagine Moses, 40 years of complaint after complaint?
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   At least twice, God said he had had enough, and he was going to wipe out the Israelites
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.560]   to start a new nation with Moses.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.840]   Moses, as always, displays such humility that when he hears the offer, he falls on his face
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.920]   and intercedes for Israel, saving them from extinction.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.960]   And then in Numbers 20, where we'll be this afternoon, the 40 years were now up.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.520]   The last of the first generation has died off.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.880]   Aaron and Miriam both die in this chapter, and it's now time to enter the promised land.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880]   And what do you suppose happens?
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   Does this second generation of Israelites learn from the mistakes of their fathers?
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.160]   No, they begin to complain, just like their parents.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   "I'm thirsty.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   There's no water.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.520]   I wish I died with my parents," they say.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.240]   Everything seems as usual.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.120]   God provides a promise.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   He will bring forth water from a rock.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.880]   And though God had commanded Moses last time to strike the rock, this time he tells Moses
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.760]   to speak to the rock.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.920]   However, Moses hits it twice.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.560]   And you know the story, God judges Moses severely, without mercy, without partiality, and tells
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.240]   Moses that he must die and not enter into the promised land because he had rebelled.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.800]   The same word used to describe Israel's rebellion.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.320]   When Moses later on pleads for God to change his mind, God gets angry at him and tells
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.920]   him to be quiet, as recorded in Deuteronomy 3.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.800]   I'm not sure if you remember the first time you heard that story.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.680]   I don't.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.080]   But I do remember the first time I read it to my children.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.440]   And it's just shocking.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's really shocking.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.920]   I mean, really, God?
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.080]   I mean, this is Moses.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   This is your friend.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.520]   Have you forgotten all that he's done?
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.600]   And he's going to die just because he hit the rock, something he had did before?
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.440]   I mean, it seems a little bit strict, even mean.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.600]   Most of us, though, we wouldn't say it out loud.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.320]   Most of us feel this way, and that's because most of us do not comprehend the holiness
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.280]   of our God.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.040]   And I would be also willing to surmise that if you think God should have showed Moses
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.600]   a little bit of partiality and favoritism, the root cause is that you think God should
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.920]   show you a little bit of favoritism as well.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   I mean, you're a pastor, right?
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.280]   You endure a lot of troubles, hardship.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.360]   So this afternoon, I'd like to analyze this passage with you, what happened, why Moses
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   responded the way that he did, and most importantly, why did God respond the way that he did?
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.160]   And I think it's going to provide a really vivid illustration of what we heard about
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.800]   this morning from Pastor MacArthur, that we triumph only through obedience.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.840]   So we'll just divide the text into two reasons we triumph only through obedience to Yahweh's
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   precepts.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.000]   The reasons we triumph only through obedience.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.240]   First of all, because God's mercy is blind, and second, because God's justice is blind.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.520]   Blind mercy and blind justice.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.640]   We're going to study just verses 10 through 13, but why don't we read starting in verse
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.920]   1 so we can get the context.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.000]   Numbers 20, verse 1, thus reads the word of the living God.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   Then the sons of Israel and the whole congregation came to the wilderness of Zin in the first
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.440]   month, and the people stayed at Kadesh, and Miriam died there and was buried there.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.980]   Now there was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.260]   and Aaron.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.960]   The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, "If only we had breathed our last
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.100]   when our brothers breathed their last before Yahweh.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.520]   Why then have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness for us and our
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.880]   beasts to die here, and why have you made us come up from Egypt to bring us to this
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   evil place?
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.480]   It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink."
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.320]   Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.800]   of meeting and fell on their faces.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.720]   Then the glory of Yahweh appeared to them, and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "Take
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.640]   the rod, you and your brother Aaron, assemble the congregation, and speak to the rock before
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.920]   their eyes that it may yield its water.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.320]   Thus you shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock, and let the congregation
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.620]   and their beasts drink."
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.880]   So Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, just as he had commanded him, and Moses and
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:49.320]   Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock, and he said to them, "Listen now, you rebels.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   Shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?"
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.580]   Then Moses raised high his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod, and water came
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.320]   forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.720]   But Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not believe me to treat me as holy
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.800]   in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.480]   land which I have given them."
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.400]   Those were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with Yahweh,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.040]   and he proved himself holy among them.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.720]   Let's pray.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:38.280]   Father, we come to your word once more, desperately in need of you and your spirit to illumine
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.680]   our minds and help us to see the glories in your law.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.320]   Help us, Father, to understand this text and to obey this text, for the glory of Christ
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   we ask.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   Amen.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.560]   Again, we'll study just verses 10 through 13, but let's dive a little bit more into
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.280]   the context, starting there in verse 1.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.360]   Verse 1 speaks of the whole congregation, that's over 2 million people, because they
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.640]   number the soldiers, and there's more than 600,000 soldiers of fighting age, that's not
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.600]   including the Levites.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.080]   And it says they came to Kadesh.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.660]   Now Kadesh is at the very north end of the Sinai Desert, essentially at the border of
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.080]   the Promised Land.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.480]   And it is the exact same place where they were when Moses sent out the 12 spies when
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.120]   they sinned against Yahweh.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.080]   It was at Kadesh that the first generation of Israel was sentenced to 40 years of wandering,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.480]   according to Numbers 13:26.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.920]   So they disobeyed, and they've wandered around the desert for 40 years, and now they've come
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.840]   back to Kadesh, in the same spot, the first generation has died off, and now the children
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.020]   are back in the exact same spot as their parents.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:09:00.960]   They are back at the edge of Edom, Numbers 20, 16 says, ready to enter the land.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.000]   And we know for sure that the 40 years are up, because both Miriam and Aaron die in this
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.280]   chapter, and Numbers 33, 38 says that Aaron died in the 40th year of their wandering.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.040]   And notice, the trial that God sends Moses' way is two-fold.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.240]   The end of verse one, Miriam dies, and then verse two, there was no water.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.560]   This is no coincidence.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.600]   God is sovereign, who is it that gives life and takes away life?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   Yahweh, and who is it that was leading them with a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.940]   of fire by night?
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.800]   Also Yahweh, and Yahweh decided to take the life of Miriam at the exact moment he decided
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.640]   to lead the people of Israel back into a place with no water.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.840]   This had to have been a significant trial for Moses, Moses and his sister Miriam, right?
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.000]   I mean, he loved her.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.280]   We don't know of another sister of Moses.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.600]   This is probably the one who saved his life all those 80 years prior.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.320]   She was also the one in Numbers 12 that was led astray by the people and was filled with
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.760]   envy of Moses.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:17.600]   Moses was surely filled with all sorts of different emotions, oh, and there's no water.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   Sort of a big deal when you're dealing with two million people and all of their animals.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.360]   Has this sort of thing ever happened to you in ministry, that in God's providence he sends
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   a trial your way right at the worst possible moment?
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.320]   Well, worse from your perspective.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.240]   We need to trust that God is in control, he knows what he's doing, and he's doing what's
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.720]   best for us in the best moment possible in order to help us to trust more in him.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.280]   Well, how do the people respond to the trial?
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.720]   We of course know the story, but let's try to put ourselves in the sandals of this original
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.080]   audience.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.800]   I think the original reader is supposed to be wondering, right, how is this second generation
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.520]   going to respond to the same trial their fathers faced?
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.840]   Have the desert wanderings fixed their complaining?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.680]   Is this second generation of Israel going to get to enter into the promised land because
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.480]   they're better than their parents?
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   Do they deserve to enter?
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:26.440]   Well, verse three, the people thus contended with Moses, and God of course, they quarreled,
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.960]   they contended, that's the root word we'll see later on, meribah.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:37.720]   So this is a genuine insurrection, this is rebellion, and the trial's heating up for
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   Moses, right?
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.640]   I mean, not having water for two million people is one thing, but dealing with an insurrection
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.440]   of two million thirsty people is a trial of a whole different kind.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   And notice what they're saying, notice what they're accusing him of, they're at the end
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.440]   of verse three.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.360]   They say, "Oh, that we would have died with our parents' generation in the desert."
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.480]   In other words, why did you lead us in circles for 40 years just to kill us at the border
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.240]   of the promised land?
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.760]   We should have died at the beginning of these terrible 40 years with you rather than now.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.280]   Verse five, "Why have you made us come up from Egypt to bring us to this evil place?"
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:21.840]   Notice end of verse five, "You promised us pomegranates and figs and grapes."
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.680]   And we laugh 'cause it's almost childish the way that they're responding, but this isn't
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.600]   a joke, and this is not some random list of fruits.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.320]   Listen to Numbers 13, 23.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.520]   This is 40 years earlier, the 12 spies were spying out the land, and to prove that it
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.080]   was a good land, what did they do?
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.720]   They brought back some fruit, says, "They came to the Valley of Eskol and from there
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.520]   cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.720]   two men with some of the pomegranates and the figs," exact same three fruits the Israelites
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.060]   mentioned here in Numbers 20.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.920]   So they're saying, "Moses, you tricked us.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.360]   There is no promised land.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.480]   There's no land filled with milk and honey.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.200]   You lied to us."
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.320]   And that answers our question if this second generation is better than their parents.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.640]   Did the desert wandering cure their unbelief?
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.560]   Did it cure their complaining?
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.680]   Not even close.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.320]   These Israelites are complaining, rebellious unbelievers just like their parents.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.480]   If they're getting into the promised land, it's gonna be utterly and completely by God's
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   mercy.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.640]   Well, how does Moses respond?
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:43.480]   Verse 26, Moses, so humble, so obedient, he falls on his face before God, God so gracious.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.960]   Verse 7, gives a promise with simple and clear instructions on how to obtain that promise
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.080]   just like always.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.440]   Notice verse 8, Moses, "Take the rod, the staff, assemble the people, speak to the rock
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.720]   and you'll get water."
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.680]   Nothing complicated.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.840]   Moses didn't need to take notes.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.600]   It's amazing how we complicate God's Word, isn't it?
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   God's Word is simple, it's accessible.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   Moses says in Deuteronomy 30, "The Word is very near to you."
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.120]   He gives us clear precepts, speak to the rock, preach the Word.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:30.520]   And we say, "Well, in our generation, we kind of need to contextualize it a little bit.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.920]   No one is gonna listen if we just preach Christ, if we just preach the Word."
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.400]   No, Yahweh's precepts are clear.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.480]   We need to do just what He says exactly how He says to do it.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.880]   So how does Moses respond?
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.320]   Verse 9, he obeys just like always.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.840]   He took the rod, notice at the end of verse 9, just as Yahweh had commanded him.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.880]   Verse 10, Moses, "Gather the people also as God had commanded."
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:02.360]   And that brings us to our first point, blind mercy, blind mercy.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.920]   Now once again, I think if we put ourselves into the sandals of the original audience,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:14.800]   the stage is set, everything is ready for Moses to pick up his rod, obey God, and save
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.720]   the day once more to work another one of Yahweh's wonders.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.440]   I mean, it's been 40 years of miracle after miracle after miracle, right?
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.500]   It's not just the plagues and the Red Sea crossing.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.320]   Also during the 40 years in the desert, their sandals didn't wear out.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.840]   They got manna out of thin air, they ate quail, water out of a rock.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.700]   Miracle after miracle, they certainly expected it by now.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:46.760]   So Moses stands before them, but then shockingly, halfway through verse 10, it says that Moses
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:53.280]   and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock, and he said to them.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.900]   And at that word them, it's the first time Moses rebelled in the Pentateuch.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:04.260]   God told him to speak to the rock, and he speaks to the people instead.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.120]   And he compounds the problem, there's various layers of sin here.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:15.720]   He says, "Listen now, you rebels," which is true, but God did not command this.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.320]   Moses then adds, "Shall we bring forth water from this rock?"
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.460]   And finally, verse 11, he strikes the rock twice.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.320]   How can Moses do this?
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.320]   Well, I certainly can't judge his heart, but we can imagine, right?
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:40.760]   Moses had put up with a lot, 40 years of childish complaining, 40 years of constant unbelief.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.720]   And this is the new generation, these are the ones that are going to enter into the
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   promised land.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:51.240]   Speculating a little bit, Moses seems to be thinking, they just don't get it.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.760]   They just don't learn.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.480]   And the current program, the current method of just giving them what they need, when they
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.280]   want it, is just not yielding results.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.760]   And if we just give them mercy, as Yahweh is suggesting, and they get the water they're
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.300]   asking for too easily, they're just not going to learn.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.940]   What they need is a fiery rebuke to get them to understand how terrible their complaining
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.660]   is.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:23.380]   And by rebuking them, Moses, in that moment, did not believe God.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.180]   He thought he knew a better way, a better way to transform the people.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.820]   He lacked faith in the sufficiency of God's word.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.860]   Men, how often do we do this today?
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.600]   How often are we tempted to follow this same man-centered, pragmatic logic?
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.300]   God says, "I'm holy.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.660]   Call sinners to repentance."
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:55.780]   And we think, "Hmm, I don't think anyone's going to repent if we say it like that.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.700]   No one is going to want to believe in a God like that with a message like that.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.780]   Let's tell them about His love and about His compassion."
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.460]   This prideful unbelief to think we know a better way than God.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:17.600]   And before we dare think that we're above that, if Moses was susceptible to this sin,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.820]   we certainly are too.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.660]   Now we know that Moses' sin is unbelief because we'll get there in a second, but the first
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.180]   thing God says to Moses in verse 12 is, "You did not believe me."
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.220]   So to obey your own way is unbelief.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.980]   It's to deny God and deny the sufficiency of His word.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:46.300]   Obedience to God's precepts, obedience to God's word is all that matters.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.520]   And kind of an interesting theological note that we see here too is that God does not
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.060]   have to explain all His reasons why He tells us to do the things He tells us to do in the
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.860]   way that He tells us.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:07.220]   I wonder, did Moses know that the rock that followed them from which they drank was Christ?
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.220]   First Corinthians 10.4.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.220]   I don't know.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:14.200]   I mean, Exodus 17.6 says that Horeb, Jesus, was standing on the rock that Moses struck.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.900]   Maybe, possibly, but I doubt it.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.780]   I doubt Moses would have consciously struck the rock twice if he'd known what it represented.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.780]   But isn't that just the point?
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.340]   We don't know and we don't need to know and God doesn't need to tell us.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.260]   We like Moses don't know all the why.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.740]   We like Job aren't privy to the celestial conversations that precede our pain.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.860]   Because running the universe is above our pay grade and we wouldn't understand it even
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.580]   if He explained it to us.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.540]   So if we have His commands, if we have His precepts, we have enough.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.740]   Ours is to obey.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:59.460]   And if we disobey, even a little bit, it is a serious crime against our holy creator.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:09.900]   It may not sound much to you to speak to the people or to hit a rock, but Moses, by screaming
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.740]   out, "Here now you rebels," he makes himself a rebel.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.860]   That word rebel is applied to every single person in this text.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.180]   You can jump down to verse 24, Numbers 20.24.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:29.540]   God says to Moses about Aaron, "You," and the you is plural in Hebrew, "You and Aaron
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.180]   rebelled against my command."
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.300]   Everyone in this chapter is a rebel.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.520]   Everyone in this chapter commits the sin of unbelief.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.460]   But now notice the point, you can't miss this.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:50.140]   Look at verse 11, "Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice."
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.940]   And then what?
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.580]   So Yahweh did not give them any water.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.840]   So Yahweh judged them like He did their fathers and sentenced them all to death, because that's
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.380]   what they deserve.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.580]   No, it's quite the opposite.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:11.820]   Moses sins, he strikes the rock and it says, "And water came out abundantly and the congregation
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.580]   and their beasts drank."
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:19.220]   It's not a little water, abundant water enough for 2 million people and all their livestock.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:25.620]   How unexpected, how merciful is Yahweh, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.500]   in loving kindness and truth.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:35.320]   And this, my friends, is why pragmatic obedience, obedience our own way, is always sinful.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.700]   Because God's mercy is blind.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.620]   God does not bless on account of your performance.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.580]   God's grace is not bound to your obedience.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.580]   Pragmatism says if it works, God must be blessing it.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:54.980]   The pragmatist there in Kadesh would have yelled out, "Moses, hit it again, it's working.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.980]   Water's coming out."
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:04.100]   Completely ignorant as to how angry Yahweh was at their rebellion, and that God gave
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.420]   them mercy, not because they deserved it, not because of their obedience, but solely
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.860]   and exclusively based on His overflowing and gracious faithfulness.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.900]   He was fulfilling His promise to their forefather.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.900]   So here's the principle.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.300]   God is God.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.300]   He makes the rules.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.820]   He says, "I will have mercy on those I will have mercy," period, end of discussion.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:34.780]   He doesn't explain to us what His criteria are or how He decides who and when to bless.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.260]   We see this illustrated in the doctrine of election.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:43.900]   Why does God elect one cadaver and not another one?
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.380]   You think because you're saved and your neighbor's not that you were a better cadaver than your
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.380]   neighbor?
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.740]   That there was something He saw in you?
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:56.860]   No, the only explanation we get is Ephesians 1, that He blesses us and elected us according
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:02.500]   to the good pleasure of His will, end of story, end of explanation.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.740]   But again, that means that we can never judge an action based on whether God blesses it
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.780]   or not, because God blesses us in spite of our rebellion to magnify the glory of His
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.580]   grace because He's so amazing.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.740]   So we can only ever judge an action based on its conformity to the Word of God.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.700]   It's the only way to judge an action.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.860]   And this is why obedience to the Word of God is essential.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.620]   If you say, "Wow, God is really prospering that church because the pastor is preaching
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.300]   fiery political messages," or, "God is really blessing that church because the pastor's
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.860]   so loving," well, then you're missing the point, because God's mercy is blind.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.700]   He does not dispense His grace based upon our performance.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.780]   Grace according to Romans 11 is never earned.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.540]   If something is earned by definition, it's not grace.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.740]   Now, to be clear, God will discipline you because of your disobedience.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.920]   Those things can be related.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.960]   And certainly, we enjoy God's blessing most when we obey Him.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:12.340]   But just like we cannot draw a one-to-one link between suffering and a particular sin,
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:17.220]   "Oh, he must have been a terrible sinner or maybe his parents because he was born blind,"
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:23.620]   Jesus in John 9 says, "No," well, in the same way, we cannot draw a one-to-one link between
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:29.340]   a particular act of obedience and God's blessing, saying, "Every time God blesses someone, it
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.260]   blesses you because of what they've done."
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:38.940]   No, because God's mercy is blind, He blesses us out of the abundance of His grace.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:44.540]   So again, we must only judge an action based upon how closely it came to obeying God's
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.220]   word.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.740]   So let us learn this lesson that Moses learned the hard way.
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.380]   It doesn't matter what the command is.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.680]   The only thing that matters is to obey.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.780]   It doesn't matter if it sounds like it's going to work or not.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.780]   It doesn't matter if it sounds illogical or ludicrous.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.780]   We need to obey.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:09.220]   I mean, just put yourself in Moses' sandals and speak to the rock and water's going to
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.220]   come out.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.780]   Does that make any human logical sense?
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.780]   No.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.300]   It sounds absurd, but it doesn't matter.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   It doesn't matter.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.820]   It doesn't matter if you prosper doing something or if you get maligned.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.020]   The results simply do not matter.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:28.300]   It's all irrelevant because God does not dispense His mercy based on our efforts but upon His
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.460]   perfect character and plan.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.860]   The only thing that matters is obeying His word exactly as it's written.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.860]   Exactly.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.360]   You know, Moses got close.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.140]   Close doesn't count.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.260]   God demands exact obedience.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.060]   God does not say, "Listen, Moses, I mean, I know Israel provoked you.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.900]   I know they goaded you, and you got pretty close, so I'll go easy on you."
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.900]   No.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.460]   God expected Moses to obey perfectly.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.560]   In fact, He expected more of Moses because Moses was His friend.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.180]   God wanted Moses to obey motivated out of His love for His God.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.180]   Right?
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.420]   "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.180]   That's what God wants from all of us.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.000]   We would love Him and obey Him.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.020]   We are God's heralds.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.860]   We have the tremendous privilege of studying God's word for a living.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.340]   What a mercy.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.340]   What a grace.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.820]   He expects us to be abounding in love for Him, obeying Him joyfully.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.820]   There's no excuses for disobedience.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.500]   If God says, "Speak to the rock," we speak.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.300]   If God says, "Preach the word," we preach.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.140]   If God says, "Pray without ceasing," we pray.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.680]   There is no lasting triumph outside of obedience to the truth of God's word.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:54.960]   Now, obviously for Israel, water was just a common grace, a mercy, a temporary mercy.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.080]   Most of the Israelites were unbelievers, right?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.840]   It was a temporary mercy for them to receive water.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.800]   But even for us today as believers, the same principle applies, right?
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.700]   That God gives us His grace and loving kindness not based on our performance, but solely and
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.480]   exclusively based on Christ and His righteousness.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.400]   We'll speak more of that at the end, but for now, let's just marvel and worship our God
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.720]   who gives His mercy to rebels like us who don't deserve it.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.640]   His mercy is blind.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.880]   He graciously blesses all of us even when we disobey, like the parable of the laborers.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:39.320]   They all worked a different amount of hours, but God blesses them blindly with a full wage,
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.120]   not based on their performance.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.660]   That leads us to point two, blind justice, blind justice.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:56.320]   Notice there in verse 12, "But Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, 'Because you did not believe
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.960]   Me to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.060]   this assembly into the land which I have given them.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.920]   You did not believe Me.'"
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.400]   It's a strong rebuke.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:15.600]   The verb there in Hebrew to believe is to trust in His faithfulness, to trust that God
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.000]   is true and trustworthy.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.680]   It's the same word we see in Genesis 15, 6, that Abraham believed God and it was credit
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.040]   to Him as righteousness.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   The point is that in this moment, Moses, who is a believer, was acting like an unbeliever,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.240]   someone who did not believe God enough to obey Him.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.840]   God was illustrating here that unbelief is the sin that keeps us from entering the promised
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.320]   land.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.160]   You remember in Hebrews 3 when the author of Hebrews is exhorting us to enter into God's
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.200]   rest and not harden our hearts like the Israelites did.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.880]   He reminds us of why the Israelites were not able to enter God's rest.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:03.680]   He says in Hebrews 3, 19, "We see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief."
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.600]   Unbelief then is that unpardonable sin that if one persists in it will shut heaven's doors
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.040]   to them.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:16.120]   Any other sin, God will forgive, but if someone refuses to believe, if they refuse to believe
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.960]   in Christ, there is no other Savior, there is no other hope.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:26.720]   You say, "Well, how do we tell if someone is a believer like Moses who fell into a momentary
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:33.280]   lapse of unbelief or if they're unbelievers like most of the Israelites destined for judgment?"
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   Well, because like we heard this morning, everyone who is justified is also being sanctified.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.120]   And Numbers 20 also illustrates this beautifully because it shows that unbelief always manifests
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.160]   itself in disobedience.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.120]   Unbelief isn't some ethereal concept that's divided from our physical world.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.240]   No, God says, "You didn't believe me enough to obey."
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.640]   Faith and unbelief always show their fruits for all to see.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.480]   Faith works.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.560]   Unbelief also works.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:13.800]   John, the apostle John, fighting this sort of Gnostic dualism says, "Let no one deceive
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   you.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.760]   The one who does righteousness is righteous."
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.660]   You say you're justified, well, then you're going to walk justly, you're going to walk
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.760]   in righteousness.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:30.280]   So the believer, when he temporarily falls into unbelief and manifests that unbelief
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:36.880]   in disobedience, will necessarily then confess his sin, repent of his unbelief, and come
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.280]   back to trust out of love for his savior.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.600]   Whereas the unbeliever lives in constant unbelief manifested by the fact that they walk in constant
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.080]   darkness and sin.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.060]   Now notice specifically in verse 12 that God says, "You did not believe me enough to treat
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.080]   me as holy in the sight of Israel."
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.160]   For the holiness of God refers to his separateness.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   God is holy.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.600]   That means that he is different than us.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.740]   He's full of glory and grandeur and majesty.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.880]   His perfections are magnificent.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.080]   He's so distinct.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.200]   And the primary way that he points out that he's different than us is that he is morally
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:23.640]   righteous and we are sinners, which is an amazing reality.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.040]   If I were God, and it's a good thing I'm not.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.680]   But if I were God, and I wanted to let Josiah Gromin know how different I was than him, I'd
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.760]   probably start by saying, "I'm eternal, and your life is just a passing breath.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:44.360]   I'm omnipresent, and you're limited to this little speck of space in my universe.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.520]   I'm self-sufficient.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.320]   I need nothing and no one to survive, and you can't even live for five minutes without
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   the oxygen I lend to you.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.040]   I'm omnipotent, and you can barely get out of bed in the morning."
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Right?
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.640]   The list could go on and on and on, but it's interesting that normally in the Bible, those
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.480]   are not the things God points out that separate him from us, because those differences pale
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.080]   in God's mind in comparison to the biggest difference of all, and that is that Josiah,
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.280]   you disobey.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.920]   You sin, and I am pure.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.200]   And God highlights this aspect of his holiness so much that holiness essentially comes to
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.700]   mean purity.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.320]   Be holy as I am holy.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.280]   And we don't think, "Okay, I need to be eternal and self-sufficient."
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:38.440]   We understand it means that we need to stop sinning and be holy as God is.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.120]   But we can't, even though that reality is true, we can't forget the original meaning
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.760]   of the word holiness.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.120]   And holiness means that God is different than us, he's separate from us, that he's glorious
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.360]   in all his perfections.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:59.560]   And I do think here when God says, "Moses, your disobedience did not show off my holiness,"
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:05.600]   that the main point that Moses, the main point is that Moses' disobedience did not display
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.240]   all of God's majesty, all of his separateness.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:17.960]   And here's the point then, God's word, God's precepts perfectly display all of God's holiness,
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.520]   all of his glory, all of his majesty, all of his splendor.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:29.560]   And when we tinker with God's word, even in the slightest detail, we necessarily tarnish
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.880]   the glory that he reveals in his word.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.400]   We tarnish his glory in the eyes of those around us.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.600]   Obeying God's word always diminishes the perfection of the revelation of God's glory.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:51.240]   When Moses did not obey God's word exactly as it was prescribed, he made God look common.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.840]   He made God look like us and not an awesome God to be feared.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:02.400]   When Moses did this, he was like a foolish child painting with his finger over a Rembrandt
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.680]   thinking that he's making it better.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.080]   You can't make God's word better.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.840]   It's perfect just as it is.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.200]   God's word cannot be improved, it is sufficient.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:19.280]   Well, just a couple of observations here on how Moses did not treat God as holy.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.200]   First, remember Moses' choice of words.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:30.520]   He says, "Here now you rebels, shall we bring water for you out of this rock?"
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.400]   Now some people say that the only thing sinful here was striking the rock instead of speaking
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.320]   to it because God did say in Numbers 28, "Moses, you shall bring forth water for them."
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.800]   So it's not like they're saying something incorrect.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.600]   But we do actually know that Moses' words were sinful here because God sentences Moses
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.300]   and Aaron to death because of their rebellion and only Moses strikes the rock.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:00.920]   In fact, we know their words are sinful also because in Psalm 106, 33, it says, "Because
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.160]   Israel provoked Moses, he spoke rashly with his lips."
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.420]   And if we compare the way that Moses is speaking here to the way he speaks in doing other miracles,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.680]   I think we see a contrast.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:20.200]   For example, in Exodus 14, verse 13, when God is about to part the Red Sea, this is
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.000]   what Moses said to the people of Israel, "Do not fear.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.560]   Stand by and see the salvation of Yahweh, which He will accomplish for you today."
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.120]   Sounds pretty different than, "Shall we bring forth water from this rock?"
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.320]   There's no "we" in Yahweh's salvation.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.000]   There's no "me and Yahweh make a really good team."
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.120]   No, Isaiah 48, 11, "For my own sake, for my own sake I do it.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.560]   My glory I will not give to another."
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.760]   God shares His glory with no one.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:01.440]   And you know, a lot of Christians wrestle with this, that we go through trials and hardships
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.640]   and God takes all the glory.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   God doesn't share.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.880]   God's going to get all the glory and I just have to suffer.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.000]   But that's not the case for the Christian.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.840]   The Bible explains to us that the glory of God is completely linked to our eternal good
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.680]   because the more He shines forth His glory and the more we see that worth, we become
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   more like Him.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:34.920]   That's what 2 Corinthians 3, 18 says, that we're transformed into His glory as we behold
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   it.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.480]   That's the goal for us to reflect His glory as His image bearers.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:47.560]   And that's where Moses failed because when he sinned, he was trying to diminish the glory
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:54.400]   of God whether intentionally or not.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.760]   Moses sinned because he did not shine forth God's holiness in that moment.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.120]   Moses inserted himself.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.640]   By adding to the Word of God, he was not displaying all of God's holiness.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:13.120]   Every time we disobey, we show too much of ourselves and not enough of God's holiness.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.920]   And God takes this very seriously.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.440]   Moses' unbelief made God look common, made Him look human.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:28.040]   Moses' anger made Yahweh look like Moses and God says, "No, I'm not like you."
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.160]   Psalm 50, 21, "You thought I was just like you so I will reprove you."
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.840]   Idolatry is fashioning Yahweh after our imagination.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.320]   Can't do that.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.920]   God's not like us.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.440]   Think about it this way.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.360]   Who among us, if we were in charge of this situation, who among us would show mercy to
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.160]   complaining Israel and then judge our friend Moses?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.540]   Would we do that?
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   Would you do that?
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.080]   I think none of us would.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.680]   But the God revealed here is worthy of the most glory just for who He is.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.560]   He shows just how utterly unique He is, completely perfect.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:14.080]   He reveals His perfect glory in the story and He is a God whose mercy is blind and whose
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.440]   justice is also blind.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.280]   And it's best that way.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.560]   It's best for God's justice to be blind.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.560]   Hold on to that thought.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.440]   We're going to come back to it in a few minutes.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.040]   But I want to just finish up the text here in verse 13.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.640]   It says, "Those were the waters of Meribah because the sons of Israel contended with
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.720]   Yahweh and He proved Himself holy among them."
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.640]   Moses did not show God's holiness to the people.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:46.400]   So God judges Moses and shows Himself to be even more clearly anything but common.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.880]   He tells His friend, "You shall not bring the people into the land."
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:55.360]   I mean, Moses rebels one time in this whole book and God judges Him blindly, severely,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.720]   without partiality.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.560]   That's very unhuman-like, very different than us.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.280]   None of us would judge like this.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.620]   The verb there in Hebrew is "reflexive."
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.640]   He proved Himself holy.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.560]   And that's kind of the summary of the whole passage.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:18.120]   They did not display God's holiness, so God does it Himself in spite of them.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:24.360]   Moses refused to show God's holiness by showing mercy to complaining Israel.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.200]   So God does it anyway, right?
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:34.440]   Because our disobedience is not going to thwart God's plan.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:40.240]   Moses' disobedience does not mean that God's going to get less glory, not on your life.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.000]   When Moses did not show God's holiness, God proved just how holy He truly is by showing
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.800]   mercy to Israel and judging His friend Moses.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.600]   That makes God very different than us.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.840]   We judge everything based on favoritism.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.640]   God judges us without consideration of who we are, and that's seen so clearly here with
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   Moses.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.520]   I mean, Moses was God's friend.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.920]   Moses was as an important of a man as there could be in God's plan, as dear as a man as
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.280]   could be in God's heart.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.480]   Remember how God speaks of Moses in Numbers 12?
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:22.560]   Miriam and Aaron grumble against Him, and God gets angry and He says, "Hear now my words.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.800]   Is there a prophet among you?
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.780]   I, Yahweh, shall make myself known to him in a vision.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.320]   I shall speak with him in a dream.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.160]   Not so with my servant Moses.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.360]   He is faithful in all my household.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.080]   With him I speak mouth to mouth, indeed clearly and not in riddles.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.680]   And he beholds the form of Yahweh.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.080]   Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.880]   So the anger of Yahweh burned against them.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.920]   God loved Moses so much that He got angry when someone spoke against Him.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920]   Right?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.520]   Numerous times God defends Moses.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.640]   I mean, He eats up Corp and His rebellion with the earth.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.120]   He gives Miriam leprosy.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:11.520]   But then when Moses himself sins, Moses receives the same blind justice as everyone else.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:18.960]   Sin is sin, and God is just, holy, and jealous for His glory, and this is the God we worship,
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.920]   an absolutely impartial judge.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:28.600]   And remember, if God judged His friend Moses impartially, we should certainly expect the
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   same.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.880]   In fact, as James 3 says, we who are teachers will receive a greater judgment.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.440]   That's compounded upon the fact that Hebrews 10, 29 says that we will face an even greater
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:46.560]   punishment in the new covenant if we reject Christ after beholding the glory of the cross.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.240]   God says to the one who tramples His son, "Leave him to Me.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   Vengeance is Mine.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   I will repay."
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.800]   It's a horrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.680]   So to whom much is given, much will be required.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:08.920]   And as pastors, this ought to instill great fear in us, to obey God in everything, to
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.080]   always strive to be doers of the Word, not just preachers of it.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.320]   Because God's judgment is blind to who we are.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   We don't get a pass for being pastors, far from it.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.480]   Furthermore, it's also blind in considering what we've done, what we can do.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.680]   I mean, think of Numbers 20, right?
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.480]   If there's anyone who had built up just a little bit of credit with God, it would have
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.600]   been Moses.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.640]   You know, the way that the world thinks about God and His justice, the idea that if I do
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.520]   a bunch of good things, then I have the opportunity to slip up every now and then, and my good
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.040]   at the end will outweigh my bad because I'm not a murderer.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.800]   And we obviously know this is erroneous, and we would never say it, but it does creep into
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   our thinking.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.240]   And I think Moses thought so too.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:03.560]   In fact, later on, like I mentioned, Deuteronomy 3, Moses tries to change God's mind.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.520]   He says, "And I pleaded with Yahweh at that time, 'Please let me go over and see the good
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.680]   land beyond the Jordan.'
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.340]   But Yahweh was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.540]   And Yahweh said to me, 'Enough from you.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.320]   Do not speak to me of this matter again.'"
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.120]   You see, God's justice is blind.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.240]   It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter what you've done or what you do afterward.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.440]   The consequences of sin are irrevocable.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:33.640]   And I think as pastors, we're particularly vulnerable to this type of error in our thinking
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.960]   because we do so much good.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.660]   So we begin to think that God needs us.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.640]   Or we reason, "I'll sin and then I'll ask forgiveness and the blood of Christ will cleanse
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   me perfectly."
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.760]   Well, first of all, be careful because that's exactly the sort of rationale that has led
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   to the apostasy of many who thought they were washed in Christ's blood when in fact they
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   were not.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.920]   But secondly, also, remember that the cross has cleared us from the eternal consequences
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.960]   of our sin but it does not remove the temporal consequences we face on this earth.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.480]   And Moses also illustrates this fact.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.120]   Moses will not face eternal condemnation for this rebellion but he certainly lost reward
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.520]   and suffered pain here on earth.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.320]   Paul says in Galatians 6, "Do not be deceived.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.880]   God is not mocked.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.600]   For whatever a man sows, that will he also reap."
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:39.800]   If you think you can sin and not receive consequences, you think you can mock God and you are wrong.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.280]   It's impossible.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.320]   God always wins.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.600]   That's the point of the last phrase.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.720]   Israel contended with Yahweh.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.880]   Israel tried to fight Yahweh and who do you think is going to win that battle?
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:57.840]   Israel contended with Yahweh and he proved himself holy among them.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:03.600]   They didn't show Yahweh to be holy so he did it himself.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.960]   Yahweh wanted to announce to the world that he is the great I am, that he can make a promise
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.440]   to Abraham and then fulfill it hundreds of years later.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.280]   Yahweh wanted mercy.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.780]   Moses wanted severity.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.420]   So what happened?
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.640]   God wins.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.560]   He was merciful to Israel and severe only with Moses.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.840]   The people received their water abundantly.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.240]   God's plan was accomplished.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.560]   God will not allow anyone to interfere with his plan.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.800]   Yahweh proved himself holy.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:41.320]   In Hebrew, the verb there, kadosh, is in the nifal stem to show his holiness.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.760]   The verb occurs less than a dozen times in the entire Bible and just four times in the
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   Torah.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.400]   So we can trace these uses together.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:55.600]   It's the word we see in Exodus 29 where God says that at the burnt altar where blood sacrifices
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:01.120]   are made, I will meet there with the sons of Israel and it shall be shown as holy by
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:08.440]   my glory, which is why later in Leviticus 10 when Nadab and Abihu offer strange fire
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:14.840]   instead of a fire, Yahweh started on that bronze altar, Yahweh kills Nadab and Abihu.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:20.320]   And interestingly, in Leviticus 10 when Moses is having to explain to Aaron because Aaron's
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:26.520]   having a hard time with the fact that his two sons just died, Moses tells Aaron, "Remember,
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:33.880]   remember Yahweh told us by those who come near me, I will be shown to be holy and before
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.760]   all the people, I will be glorified."
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.200]   Moses tells Aaron, "Look, God's ministers have an incredible task to show forth God's
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.080]   holiness in the ministry of his truth."
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:53.120]   This can only be done when the preacher himself obeys that truth and Moses forgot his own
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.120]   warning.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.280]   Moses inserted himself.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:03.480]   God says, "My ministers will be held to a higher standard to demonstrate my holiness
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:10.320]   to my people, to get out of the way and let the people see my glory and my holiness."
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.760]   And we like Moses forget this as well.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.280]   The preacher, not one of us is immune to this.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.480]   We finish the sermon and someone compliments the message and we thank them and we forget
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.680]   to say, "Praise the Lord, it's all of him."
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:33.160]   We forget our place, that our entire ministry is a mercy of God, 2 Corinthians 4, so we
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.000]   must fade away that his holiness might shine.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.480]   We forget the words of the greatest man ever born of a woman, "He must increase."
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.760]   And in order for that to happen, "I must, I must decrease."
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:55.600]   So it doesn't matter if someone slanders your preaching or said you did a terrible job,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.440]   why do you care about your own glory, your own honor?
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:07.360]   You have one job, one job, for the holiness of Christ to shine through your ministry.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.760]   The thing is like we see here in Numbers 20, at the end of the day, Christ will be glorified
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.720]   with or without you, right?
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.760]   Your disobedience is not going to thwart his plan.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:23.400]   Sometimes I envision God's holiness like a freight train speeding down the track and
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:28.760]   you can hop on and enjoy the ride or be run over, but there's no stopping it.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.320]   There's no changing its direction.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.040]   Yahweh will prove himself to be holy, period.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.360]   And he will do it through your obedience or if you oppose him by placing your corpse under
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:46.840]   the feet of the one who sits at his right hand, but he will not be stopped, he's omnipotent.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:53.280]   So you can obey and get a front row seat to watch Yahweh work his wonders or you can disobey
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:00.440]   and miss out because the father loves his son too much to let his perfections be dimmed.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:06.240]   And the son loves his father too much to not shine forth the full glory of his holiness.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.840]   And the spirit loves the son too much to not transform us perfectly into the exact imprint
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:17.880]   of the son so that all of God's communicable attributes might be seen in all his creation.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:24.840]   And that is our joy and our crown, that Christ be glorified so that we can be transformed
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.840]   into his image.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:34.480]   Well, in conclusion, brothers, I think we've seen like so many doctrines that when understood
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:41.840]   correctly, the fact that God's mercy and justice are blind should bring us great fear when
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:48.640]   we disobey and great peace and joy when we believe and obey.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.280]   On the one hand, God's blind justice should cause a great fear to overcome you when you
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.000]   disobey in unbelief.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.520]   Because if you think that you're gonna get to heaven when you die because, well, I'm
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:04.840]   a pastor, I preach the Bible, I evangelize, I mean, I've helped a lot of people.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.040]   I have good theology, I know the truth.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:12.840]   I mean, I don't love Christ like I used to, I'm addicted to a couple of sins, but I think
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.480]   God's gonna overlook them given all the other things I've done.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.520]   Know this, God's justice is completely blind.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:26.000]   He hates sin and is a just judge and he will judge every human being without partiality,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.480]   without favoritism, every single sinner will receive judgment for all eternity in the fires
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.480]   of hell.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:38.640]   You say, but God is also merciful, he'll show me mercy, not like that.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.240]   God gives justice to everyone.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.400]   His mercy, he showed to us in sending his son.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.600]   That's how you receive mercy, in his son.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.240]   If you don't love the son, it's all justice.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.360]   Without Christ, there's no mercy.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.120]   No one will escape, 'cause every human being is a sinner deserving of hell.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.480]   We desperately need Christ, Christ is our only hope.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:07.800]   And that's one of the greatest lessons this passage demonstrates for us, that even Moses,
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:13.400]   the great and powerful and amazing Moses, even he cannot bring God's people into the
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.560]   promised land.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:20.440]   So we see this passage is not about Moses, it's not to reveal Moses to us, it's to reveal
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.920]   to us that we need a better Moses.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.540]   We need a perfect Moses, one who never speaks rashly, one who never stops trusting God.
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:33.560]   We need our perfect prophet, priest, and king, we need Jesus Christ.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:39.220]   And here's the good news, if you believe in this greater Moses, in Jesus, the eternal
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:45.360]   son of God, the creator of the world, who became flesh, who came to earth, lived the
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.760]   perfect life that we can't live, who died the death we deserve, and was raised on the
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:55.600]   third day for our salvation, if you believe in that Christ, you will receive not blind
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.180]   justice, but blind mercy.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.680]   And that is the best possible news, because it doesn't matter what you've done.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.920]   If you're a criminal, dying on a cross, it doesn't matter who you are, if you're the
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:12.160]   most worthless Gentile on the planet, it doesn't matter if you're an adulterer, or trans, or
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.520]   a slave trader, or a self-righteous pastor.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.000]   If you believe in Jesus Christ, if you would cry out to God to save you from the merits
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.840]   of Christ, God promises to impartially overwhelm you with his mercy, only according to the
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.400]   perfect life of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.820]   You see, we need to see these two truths, that God's justice is blind, and God's mercy
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.820]   is blind.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:43.380]   We need to see it's best this way, because the gospel is guaranteed by these two facts.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.840]   It's necessary to observe in Numbers 20, as hard as it is to accept, that God has the
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:56.040]   ability to judge blindly, objectively, and without partiality, because that's the only
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.440]   way the gospel works.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:05.420]   When God took his beloved and perfect Son, and imputed our sins in his account, and then
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:12.920]   God without partiality to his Son, poured out his wrath upon Christ for my sin.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.360]   He's a blind judge.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.000]   Praise his holy name.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.200]   A judge, any less impartial, could not have done that to his own Son.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:27.740]   In Hebrew, being impartial literally means not seeing someone's face, judging them without
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.060]   knowing who they are.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:38.120]   God judged Christ for my disobedience impartially, without ever looking at Christ's face, as
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   it were.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:45.280]   I thank the Lord for God's blind justice, as it results in my justification.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.040]   But point two, we also need to see that God's mercy is blind.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.560]   We saw that when God blessed rebellious Israel.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:59.880]   And that is the best possible news, that God can look at me, a filthy, wicked sinner, and
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:06.900]   yet amazingly show me mercy, solely on the basis of Christ's righteousness in my account.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:13.440]   If God were a respecter of persons, if he considered who we are, if I had to stand before
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:20.740]   a lesser judge, a lesser judge would see Christ's imputed righteousness in my account, but then
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:29.000]   look up and say, "Wait a second, I know that face, Josiah Grauman, right?
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.520]   I remember you.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.280]   I remember what you've done.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.800]   I remember what you said to me that night.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.360]   I remember how you defiled my temple, how you grieved my spirit.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.880]   I remember what you did to my son.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   You're going to burn."
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:51.160]   Not Yahweh, he is holy, he's different than us, his mercy is blind.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:57.960]   He lavishes his love upon us solely and exclusively, based on the loveliness of his son, blind
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.680]   to the filthiness of our faces.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:06.440]   What a judge, who takes rebellious sinners like us, and by his blind justice and mercy
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.600]   declares us righteous, adopts us into his family, changes us in the image of his son,
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.160]   and then brings us home to rejoice over us.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.560]   What a wonder, what a motivation to love him and obey him.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:26.520]   What a motivation to do what he asks us to do, to show off his holiness in the world,
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.600]   reflecting it in our obedience to the truth.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.640]   Let's pray.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:43.120]   Father, we thank you for your word, because in it we see all your glory shining in the
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.840]   face of our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.600]   We thank you for him.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.760]   Thank you for the salvation that you have wrought in Christ.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:05.160]   We beg you that you would help us to see more of Jesus Christ every day, to see more of
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:12.280]   his glory, see more of his worth, more of his holiness, and that we would reflect his
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.080]   holiness to the world in the way that we obey you.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   Thank you for your spirit that you've left with us, who transforms us and helps us.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.520]   We love you and we thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.520]   Amen.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.520]   Amen.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:27.520]   Amen.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.680]   (audience applauding)
