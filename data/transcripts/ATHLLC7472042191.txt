[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.360]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.280]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I started this show
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320]   almost two years ago because I love doing all the research
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.800]   to optimize every aspect of my life.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.240]   And I wanted a way to share that journey with you.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.280]   After the first dozen or so episodes,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.580]   I knew this would be my full-time thing,
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.360]   but somehow it took me another year and a half
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.400]   until I was ready to go all in.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.880]   Now, I am so glad that finally happened,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.200]   but why did it take me so long to commit
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.400]   to something I knew deep down inside I was ready for?
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.960]   Well, that is exactly what we're gonna talk about today.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.840]   And I'm joined by the perfect person
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.420]   for the conversation, Matt Higgins.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.160]   Matt grew up in poverty and dropped out of high school
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.760]   at the age of 16 before going on to graduate from law school
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.940]   and then become the youngest press secretary
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.960]   in New York City history during 9/11,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.560]   where he led the effort to rebuild
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.040]   the World Trade Center site
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.080]   before becoming the executive vice president
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.320]   of the New York Jets
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.840]   and then the vice chairman of the Miami Dolphins.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.080]   Matt was also a guest shark on "Shark Tank."
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.160]   He teaches at Harvard Business School,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.080]   and through the investment firm he co-founded, RSC Ventures,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.500]   he's invested in some of America's most beloved brands.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.280]   So what does all this have to do with me
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.200]   taking too long to go all in on this podcast?
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.080]   Well, Matt just published an incredible book
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.780]   that I wish I had been able to read a year ago,
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.480]   where he shares his framework to stop hedging
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.560]   and unlock your full potential.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.520]   It's called "Burn the Boats."
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.160]   So today, we're gonna talk about
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.520]   why too many of us are driven by fear,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.080]   why we wait for the perfect moment to act,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.800]   and why so often we subconsciously construct a safety net
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.260]   or plan B that actually holds us back.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.760]   But we're not just gonna talk about it.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.720]   We're gonna lay out an actionable playbook
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.640]   to overcome all these hesitations
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.880]   and burn your boats, as Matt says.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.320]   We'll also cover understanding your own motivations,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.800]   overcoming fear, processing failure,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.280]   managing crises, asking the right questions,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.400]   and a lot more.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.660]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.240]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.560]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.720]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.660]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.100]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.960]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.600]   from Anyday, I am a total convert,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.720]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.040]   for this episode.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.080]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.680]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.320]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.240]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.400]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.600]   freezer, and oven-safe too.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.240]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.440]   to launch the beautiful Matt Black IO collection,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.720]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.080]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.780]   Matt, thanks for being here.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.680]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.320]   I'm excited, Chris.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.240]   - It's funny, I read the front cover of the book
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.400]   before I opened it, before I dug into it,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200]   and it's like, you can unleash your full potential,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.040]   all this, there's a lot of books
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.440]   that cover topics like that.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.120]   Awaken the Giant Within, Tony Robbins, all this stuff.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   What made you feel like we needed another book in here,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.560]   and what's gonna set this story apart?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.600]   - That's a great question.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.100]   Well, big picture, don't think there are new ideas
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.400]   in the universe, mostly they've all been discovered,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.020]   but there's new packaging.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.520]   And when I read a lot of business books on the subject,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   not disparaging anyone in particular,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.480]   I do feel like they're written like reference manuals,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.820]   number one, and by the third chapter,
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.880]   you've basically got the crux of it.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.240]   They're very repetitive,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.740]   and that's not how people learn information.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.240]   I'm a storyteller by heart,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.600]   was a journalist when I was a kid.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   I know how to explain, articulate, package stories,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.720]   and so I wanted to create a book that was very readable,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.920]   that was a business book, but masked as a memoir,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.040]   masked as a riveting historical fiction journey,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.400]   and sort of break the genre to some extent,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.160]   with the goal being you could read it
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.440]   from beginning to end in one setting,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.280]   and be left with a feeling of infinite possibility.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.200]   So packaging to me, I think is actually very important,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.000]   storytelling is very important,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.340]   and I've accumulated a lot of wisdom
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.800]   through a lot of heartbreak,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.860]   and a lot of incredible opportunities,
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.760]   and thought that I had something special to share.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.520]   - I think you're selling two parts of this short.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.920]   I think the idea of there being this plan B,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.040]   that there are benefits from not having,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.640]   and getting rid of, I think is a unique perspective
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.520]   I hadn't read before, and so we're gonna get into that.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.100]   And then, I think the second is you said
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.320]   it's a business book, I'm curious if this really
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.000]   is just for people running businesses,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.080]   wanting to start a business,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.820]   'cause my perspective reading it,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.220]   was that it has a lot more broad applicability
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.280]   than just being for business people.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.320]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   Like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.120]   but I would argue that business is just the tapestry,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.480]   or the canvas rather,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.360]   and that at the end of the day,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.480]   it's really just about anybody, which is everybody,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.880]   looking to unleash their potential.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   - I heard you say, this is for people who wanna break out,
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.700]   they feel like the universe has a lot more in store for them,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.660]   but they keep finding obstacles.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.440]   So let's just jump in, what do you think
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.960]   some of those common obstacles are
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.120]   that kind of hold people back from pushing forward?
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.680]   - What I tried to do with this book,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.040]   and had in my head the entire time, is show, don't tell.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.960]   Like when I use that third person voice, Matthew,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.200]   like you're at the center of the journey too much here.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.280]   You wanna show and illustrate rather than tell,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.320]   and a lot of books I think just tend to lecture you,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.520]   and therefore it doesn't quite stick.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.280]   So that's a way of saying the boat in my book,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.800]   historically, is meant to be literally the escape route,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.680]   that's how military strategists use it,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.280]   burn the boats is literally burning your escape route.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   In my case, the boat is meant to be a metaphor
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.480]   for all the things in our lives that hold us back
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.160]   when we're at the threshold of doing something great,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.280]   something uncomfortable, and a lot of that has to do
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.080]   first with internal issues.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.240]   That aren't really discussed, certainly I feel like
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.320]   they're not discussed at my level enough,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.760]   and that's imposter syndrome.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.520]   In my case, it was shame, the metaphorical boat
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.120]   that I needed to burn first was the shame I carried around
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.760]   from the stigma of growing up in abject poverty
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.320]   and taking care of my mother who died when I was 26,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.600]   being a high school dropout, getting a GED.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.520]   There was all this shame that I carried
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.040]   that I didn't realize until life brought me to my knees
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.400]   that even though I had achieved a pretty significant level
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.080]   of success at an early age, objectively,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.800]   I hadn't really scratched the surface of my potential
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.920]   until a bunch of things happened in my life
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.520]   that brought me to my knees.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.280]   I was like stripped away and we can get into this,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.040]   and then I realized, oh, you haven't really done anything
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.400]   yet, right, like any kind of self work.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.720]   And so a lot of the issues that we need to do,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.600]   the metaphorical boats for all of us are internal.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.200]   - How does someone who maybe hasn't even thought about
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.280]   what those things that are holding them back are
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880]   even begin to identify them?
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.520]   Is there a process or questions you ask yourself
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.000]   to even start to understand that?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.480]   - Yeah, I think self-awareness is the greatest arbitrage
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.320]   in the universe.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.440]   We're sort of taught that we should go to Barnes & Noble
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.920]   and buy my book or go on YouTube, watch TED Talk,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.320]   and no one ever emphasizes like actually the greatest upside
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.200]   in ROI you can have is self-awareness
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.960]   and reflecting what's going on inside you.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.240]   So the first question, even when I'm doing a deal
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.040]   and I find that a founder or CEO or entrepreneurs
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.640]   help resistant, I try to identify what are you afraid of?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.480]   Like anyone out there listening,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.840]   if you find it hard to assess your flaws or your failures
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.640]   and reflect, the question I always say is like,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.000]   what are you afraid of?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200]   And the answers usually fall into these different buckets
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.500]   and I'll just throw out a few.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.400]   Usually it's stigma, it's some kind of judgment
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   from a super authority, a parental figure or a spouse
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.440]   or a friend group that if I acknowledge some type
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.000]   of shortcoming or even an aspiration,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.360]   I wanna be a musician, my dad's gonna judge me.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.840]   There is something that's getting in the way
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.600]   of somebody being reflective of their dreams,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.520]   of their flaws, and it's usually something
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.440]   that was prosthetically installed externally, long sentence,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.640]   but in other words, it's not that nature put it in there.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.360]   I think nature wires us to be reflective actually
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.960]   'cause it's a way to protect ourselves,
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.280]   but nurture, your friend group, those parental figures,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.840]   those people in your lives, over time they accumulate
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.380]   and they prevent you from wanting to look in.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.560]   So the number one exercise I go through with anyone
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.420]   when I'm establishing that rapport
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.400]   and we're trying to establish a relationship or do a deal
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   and I find that they under index for self-awareness,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.000]   I try to identify like, what are they afraid to find out?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.560]   - So let's say someone goes through this process,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.300]   like, okay, one of the things for me I'll share
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.360]   is the first two jobs I had out of college I didn't like.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.440]   So I was convinced for probably a decade
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.680]   that I couldn't be happy and make money.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.660]   And so I was so afraid that I would either work a job
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.740]   I didn't like or have no money,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.500]   that this entire optimization and savings journey
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.080]   really began from, I need to find every way I can
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.520]   to save as much money as possible
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.980]   so I don't have to rely on a job to be unhappy.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.020]   And over a decade, as I managed to do that saving,
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.020]   I also managed to realize, oh, there are other jobs,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.700]   there are other things you can do with your life
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.780]   that will make you happy.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.820]   But it took me a lot of work trying to figure out
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.440]   why do I think that I couldn't make money and be happy?
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.680]   What is it?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.720]   So it actually came to me,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.400]   but it's not sure I knew what to do with it for years.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   So what does someone do if they identify
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.240]   the thing that is holding them back
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.320]   or the thing they're afraid of, and then what?
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.280]   - I don't know.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.540]   That's for them to figure out, Chris.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.160]   I wanna get a tattoo eventually,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   now I'm putting this out there in the world,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.240]   but I can't find the words that are lasting enough
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.780]   to wanna imprint on my body.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.640]   If I had to settle right now,
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.480]   it would be to face everything.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.180]   If you just simply acknowledge the fact
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.140]   that if you face everything,
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.660]   including the thing you identified
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.820]   as the thing holding you back, that is where.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.820]   So let me use myself as a case study.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.900]   When I say that life brought me to my knees,
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.700]   I had had cancer when I was 32 years old.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.940]   I had testicular cancer.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.020]   And when I was diagnosed, I talk about this in the book,
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.220]   my first reaction was concealment.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.420]   That once people find out that I have cancer,
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.660]   and I was worried about losing my right testicle,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.900]   that's like a tremendous trauma
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.000]   to go through in 24 hours, right?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.340]   But I was actually more concerned
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.580]   about everybody around me was gonna think I was weak.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.620]   And now is the time they're finally gonna take Matt out.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.140]   I met my HR director on the corner of 57th Street
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.020]   because I didn't want anybody to see me in the office
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.080]   so I could change my paperwork, my beneficiary, should I die?
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.020]   And then two days later, I was like,
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.360]   how am I gonna prove to everybody that I'm undefeated?
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.380]   And I was running the New York Jets business at the time,
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.200]   and there was a dinner with the coaches.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.500]   And I decided to show up to that dinner,
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.900]   and sit down, everyone's looking at me, it's cringy,
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.860]   I have ice on my crotch, but I thought I was all tough.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.340]   And I raised a glass and did a toast.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.940]   I said, "Hey, I wanna tell everyone what my new motto is."
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.300]   And I said, "It's half the balls, twice the man."
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.220]   And I said, "I just ordered dog tags,"
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.460]   which I still have to this day.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.180]   I tell this story because in my 20s,
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.180]   that was like, early 30s, wow, that's so tough.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.080]   Look what you're telegraphing, right?
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.220]   It wasn't until later on when I got divorced
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.400]   and my whole identity kinda crumbled, right?
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.820]   As this young kid who was able to do everything early
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.420]   or succeed earlier, press, press, press.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.080]   This was one thing I couldn't press through,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.100]   and it was a public shame that I needed to own.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.020]   That's how I saw it at the time.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.740]   But then I started reappraising everything,
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.020]   saying, "Why did I go back to work two days later
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.140]   after I had cancer and was gonna die?
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.720]   And why have I been behaving like the house is on fire?"
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.520]   And I realized, it's like I never warned
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.980]   the death of my mother, and I never left
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.200]   that tiny apartment in Queens,
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.480]   living in that Roach Motel with no food,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.340]   with eviction notices on the door,
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.740]   and Con Edison about to turn off the power,
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.040]   that I had never stopped living
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.820]   in that state of hypervigilance,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.140]   despite the fact that I ran the New York Jets.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.320]   So what was I afraid to look at?
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.740]   I was afraid to look at the pain and suffering
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.140]   of that effort to try to save my mother.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.740]   Once I had nothing left,
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.300]   because my identity had been stripped
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.460]   and I had sort of gone into a depression, right,
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.540]   to an extent, that was I able to realize my behavior,
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.300]   right, to look at it for what it was,
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.140]   and that changed the entire course of my career.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.720]   So it's hard to say what you're specifically supposed to do,
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.980]   but I know what you're supposed to do is look within,
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.780]   and once you identify it, is to face it and hug it,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.060]   and like embrace it, like almost with excitement.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.520]   When I realized your behavior makes no sense,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.120]   because you think you're being chased,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.620]   when you're no longer being chased,
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.980]   once I realized the boogeyman wasn't behind me,
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.620]   then everything started changing about my behavior.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.340]   - And are there things in your routine or your daily life
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.740]   that you now do differently,
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.940]   because you're in this new state?
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.140]   - Oh, I mean, so many things.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.620]   Like let's just start as a leader,
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.300]   back to that story I just told you about,
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.540]   have the balls twice a man.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.300]   Imagine you worked for me at that time,
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.060]   and you were dealing with something in your life,
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.100]   and you needed some space to heal, to mourn, to recover,
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.420]   but you know the boss literally just had a surgery
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.540]   to remove a testicle on his back at the office.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.060]   That would tell you, telegraph to everyone around you,
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.200]   that unless you are in a state as extreme as that,
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.220]   you better suck it up.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.420]   So to answer your question, I have done a 180,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.180]   and then I try to create an environment
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.660]   where people can surface the issues they're dealing with,
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.660]   because one, you make better decisions,
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.820]   and two, if people have space to be human,
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.060]   you get more out of them in the end.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.620]   So that's one example.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.700]   And in my relationships,
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.380]   I tend to very quickly create space to be vulnerable
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.100]   and share details that maybe can be a little shocking,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.940]   but it's to open up the permission to do that.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.420]   But in every area of my life,
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.420]   I am constantly trying to refine my ability to be self-aware
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.140]   and be unafraid about what I'm gonna find.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.140]   I'm constantly auditing my motives.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.340]   Like, why am I doing this?
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.420]   Even my own book, frankly,
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.700]   sometimes I say I wrote my book so I'd read my book,
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.980]   'cause I'm like, wait, now I am not on brand.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.840]   If I wrote it in a book,
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.220]   I gotta like actually live to it
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.520]   or else it's kind of embarrassing.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.140]   So my book is now my accountability partner.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.940]   I read every day when I stray from it.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.380]   - Okay, so we've kind of talked about a little bit
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.140]   of what you need to do to evaluate yourself,
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.700]   understand what might be holding you back.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.740]   If we look forward now,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.600]   I know a lot of people who maybe they're not caught up
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.640]   in what's holding them back,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.100]   but they don't know where to go.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.720]   They know they are destined for something,
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.220]   but it's not that they're being held back,
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.980]   it's that they haven't figured out what's their motivation,
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.940]   what are they good at,
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.140]   what could they leverage in their life or their skills
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.380]   to start a company, do something at their current job,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.340]   anything.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.260]   I know you talk a lot about this in the book,
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.740]   but what do you think people should do
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.780]   to try to figure out where their path should go?
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.780]   - I have this dialogue with students oftentimes
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.660]   at Harvard Business School.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.460]   You would think top of the world, right?
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.140]   You've made it, you're at Harvard Business School,
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.340]   your life has been de-risked,
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.340]   you'll always have a six figure job.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.900]   And yet I find even at that level,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.540]   people can sometimes be totally lost.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.660]   And it's because they're asking themselves
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.540]   the wrong question.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.980]   They're asking the question of,
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.140]   what do I wanna do as opposed to who I wanna be?
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.000]   So I go through this discovery exercise
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.420]   with everybody I meet,
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.300]   and I say, when you imagine yourself the happiest,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.460]   are you a creator or are you an executor?
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.220]   When you imagine the environment that you thrive in,
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.540]   are you alone at a desk or are you in an office?
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.900]   The who do I wanna be
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.900]   and how do I wanna spend my time questions
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.700]   are way more important than what do I wanna be.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.500]   I wanna be a lawyer, I wanna be a...
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.300]   I actually think we should be spending way more time
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.820]   meditating about context, environment,
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.940]   the cues that tell you a little bit more about yourself.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.300]   For example, in this exercise, it's in the book,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.780]   I was talking to a student
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.380]   trying to figure out what they wanna be.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.700]   And then in the series of questions,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.820]   she had said, actually, I wanna be the one
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.780]   who enables a brilliant visionary,
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.220]   but I don't think I have it in me.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.700]   So I wanna be the one who uses my hard skills
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.620]   to make somebody's dream come true.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.540]   And I said, okay, we can work with that.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.820]   Well, what kind of context do you enjoy being?
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.980]   And she said, her name was Rachel.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.820]   Well, I love the beauty industry
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.660]   and I'd love to end up there.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.300]   I said, oh, well, as luck would have it,
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.300]   I'm good friends with Bobbi Brown.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.180]   Bobbi Brown, admittedly, hates math.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.060]   And she's about to launch this new company
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.300]   called Jones Road and finally go out on her own.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.260]   And she needs somebody, a quant and to help her with that.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.740]   And I picked up the phone, put it on the table
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.820]   and I said, if Bobbi Brown answers right now,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.140]   this is what's meant to be.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.980]   She did.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.140]   And fast forward, Rachel ended up working for Bobbi Brown
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.740]   and launching her new brand.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.900]   So I just say that as an illustration
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.820]   about what happens when you shift the questions
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.100]   to where do you wanna work, what company,
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.860]   to who do you wanna be?
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.940]   And I go through that in the book too,
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.660]   these kinds of questions that help you identify
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.180]   who you are as a person.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.460]   - I mentioned that some people might not know
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.420]   where they wanna go.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.660]   And you mentioned a couple of things I could talk about.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.900]   You have an exercise in the book
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.900]   that I think people should buy and take
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.540]   no matter where you are in your career.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.140]   What about when someone has an idea of what they should do?
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.540]   And this is kind of gonna bring it back
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.220]   to the title of the book.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.940]   You know, they're kind of wavering.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.780]   For me, I started this podcast and when I did,
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.460]   I kind of put one toe in the water and said,
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.500]   let's see if there's eight episodes.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.260]   Let's run it for a year before I kind of really jump into it.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.060]   I think this is one of the biggest themes titled the book.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.540]   So obviously it's one of the biggest themes,
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.260]   but how do people really get the buy-in
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.700]   and commitment in themselves?
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.980]   And what's kind of the research say about the way you plan
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.140]   and the impact it can have on the outcome?
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.300]   - Yeah, when I meet someone or a business owner or founder
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.540]   who the business is either failing or in some respects,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.220]   it's failing them emotionally
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.260]   because it no longer satisfies their soul.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.180]   Few years in, when I do the post-mortem about it,
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.340]   like how did we get here?
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.860]   What I often find, it's because they refuse
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.020]   to ask the right questions at the beginning of the journey.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.060]   And there's a few reasons why.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.580]   When we have a great idea at three o'clock in the morning,
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.060]   most people are so excited
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.420]   that they've had something that stirred them,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.580]   especially if they're in a bad situation,
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.780]   that they are then afraid to subject that idea to scrutiny
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.740]   because we also aren't taught to focus on opportunity costs,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.860]   especially if we don't value ourselves enough.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.740]   We don't wanna talk about opportunity costs.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.780]   We instead focus on how do I implement this idea?
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.140]   And I think that's how most people find themselves
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.980]   in a bad position.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.660]   So I do the opposite, right?
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.340]   I totally focus when I have a big idea on opportunity cost.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.420]   I try to project Matt Higgins three years from now
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.100]   and ask whether this idea is big enough,
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.420]   interesting enough, valuable enough
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.420]   to sustain me three years from now.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.380]   That requires you to believe two fundamental things.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.540]   One, if you're somebody who come up with a good idea,
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.780]   you can come up with an even better idea a week from now.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.140]   It's a little bit like real estate.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.020]   Brokers will always tell you
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.860]   there's always a better house
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.300]   coming on the market next week.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.620]   The same is true with somebody who has an idea factory.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.420]   So don't be afraid to rule out your own idea.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.900]   And then two, I go through the exercise
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.420]   of opportunity cost.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.980]   I try to imagine what could be better than this?
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.460]   What could be three years from now
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.860]   when I'm out of this situation?
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.700]   And the reason why that's so important
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.060]   is most people make relative decisions
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.460]   to the situation they're in to escape it.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.220]   Most big decisions we make,
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.820]   and you see this in personal relationships
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.220]   when somebody leaves somebody for another person
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.300]   that rarely works out.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.580]   And same thing with a job.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.820]   If you take a job just to leave the last job,
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.860]   that usually will leave you unsatisfied too.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.020]   So the reason why this opportunity cost decision matrix
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.060]   is so important,
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.180]   'cause it will help you figure out,
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.220]   am I running from something or running to something?
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.140]   So I go through in the book,
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.220]   this exercise around opportunity cost
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.740]   to pressure test our own ideas.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.980]   And if you do that,
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.020]   and you spend a couple of days or a week
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   going through that exercise,
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.540]   you'll make a much better decision
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.100]   that's a sustainable decision.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.420]   - Like many of you out there,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.700]   I love Notion.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.580]   And I am so happy to be partnering with them
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.540]   for this episode,
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.100]   because I literally use Notion every single day
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.940]   for notes, trip planning, managing our family,
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.820]   and even running all the hacks.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.700]   It is definitely one of my all time favorite tools.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.860]   And I'm excited to tell you
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.380]   about their latest amazing feature, Notion AI,
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.700]   which can help you automate tedious tasks
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.460]   and streamline your workflow.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.460]   For example, you can save time and write faster
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.900]   by letting Notion AI handle the brainstorm and first draft,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.900]   or turn your messy notes into something
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.420]   a lot more polished.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.980]   I've been using it the past month,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.580]   and it's blown my mind on multiple occasions.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.100]   In fact, when I was trying to explain
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.740]   what homeowner's insurance was in last week's episode,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.820]   I just asked Notion AI to write a paragraph overview
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.740]   of what homeowner's insurance is for, and boom.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.860]   I can tell you firsthand that Notion AI
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.140]   helps you work faster, write better, and think bigger,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.780]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.900]   And the best part,

[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.220]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.740]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.300]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.980]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.340]   as you build your wealth.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.620]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.460]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.620]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.140]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.140]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.540]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.540]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.820]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.980]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.340]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.060]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.860]   are first generation wealth,
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.940]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.060]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.420]   and learn from each other
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.020]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.300]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.620]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.060]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.220]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.180]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.660]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.100]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.460]   to your children's education
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.740]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.180]   So many of these conversations
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.420]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.060]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.940]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.100]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.180]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.300]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.820]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.780]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.540]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.940]   And you mentioned the idea
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.420]   of just leaving a job for another job.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.700]   So to go back to the,
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.500]   this isn't just about running a business,
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.660]   this isn't just about being a founder,
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.020]   ideas that came to my mind
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.380]   were deciding to quit your job
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.740]   to do something totally different.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.460]   That isn't starting a company.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.900]   Are there ways that you think people
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.340]   can process those big decisions
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.020]   and think about the things holding them back?
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.620]   So let's say we've identified,
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.980]   okay, I'm not just trying to escape this job I don't like.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.180]   I've really found a thing I think I'm passionate about.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.980]   I went through this myself over the course of 18 months
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.380]   with this podcast.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.500]   But I think there are a lot of people out there
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.860]   who they have the idea.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.900]   They're not being pushed away
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.660]   as much as they are being pulled,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.860]   but they're just scared or there's fear about going all in.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.300]   Let's talk about going all in.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.700]   Let's talk about burning the boat.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.260]   Let's talk about why maybe going slow
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.420]   or having a plan B isn't actually helping you.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.460]   Yeah, so we have our idea.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.420]   We've done our exercise.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.340]   We've pressure tested opportunity costs.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.420]   It's an idea worth pursuing.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.740]   We're ready to go.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.180]   And then we get stuck.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.820]   So what are the reasons people often get stuck?
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.420]   Obviously one is fear.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.180]   When people sometimes hear about the title of my book,
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.020]   "Burn the Boats,"
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.820]   they presume I mean reckless abandon,
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.140]   but the book would be called "Burn the Boats"
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.700]   with you in it, and it's not.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.420]   So I am one of the most paranoid risk takers
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.580]   you're ever gonna meet.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.540]   But how you synthesize risk and fear is everything
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.300]   when it comes to plan A.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.540]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.020]   That those who are able to fully commit
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.780]   to their own dreams and ambition
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.380]   have done the work to process the worst case scenario
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.260]   at the outset.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.300]   So I am always going through the following exercise
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.500]   when I have a big idea that I wanna go all in on,
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.340]   and that is one,
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.260]   what's the worst possible thing that could happen
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.820]   if this does not work out?
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.100]   First question I ask,
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.820]   what would I do if the worst thing
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.620]   that could possibly happen happened?
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.940]   How would I mitigate it?
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.820]   I have never asked myself that question
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.020]   and never had an answer to mitigate
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.100]   that is entirely within my control.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.060]   So what I find is mostly the reasons are not practical.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.580]   They have to do with judgment and fear of being judged
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.700]   or fear of being embarrassed.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.420]   But to the extent to which it's,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.340]   I started a new job and it ended up being out of my depth,
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.300]   that was my plan A.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.140]   You know, you could always be like,
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.500]   I'll just go back and get that other job
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.860]   because we're primal creatures.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.580]   We are already equipped with the ability to defend ourselves
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.860]   when our plan A doesn't work out.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.140]   But unless we pressure test that at the beginning,
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.660]   then the third question I ask,
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.100]   what's the probability
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.860]   that the worst case scenario will materialize?
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.780]   Usually the probability is actually very low
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.220]   because we could catastrophize if you pressure test it.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.220]   And then the fourth question I ask is,
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.020]   what would I be willing to do to have that plan A?
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.780]   What would I be willing to endure
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.300]   to end up having that work out?
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.740]   So in the case of Harvard,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.340]   when I taught at Harvard Business School,
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.700]   which was very uncomfortable to me,
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.620]   I'd never been in a classroom before,
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.540]   but I wanted this so desperately,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.540]   the idea that I had performed well at Harvard
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.980]   and had left these kids with something
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.340]   that was five times more valuable than their tuition,
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.020]   which was the objective I set.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.580]   I was like, I would walk on glass to succeed.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.900]   I would subject myself to endless ridicule, public scorn.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.180]   I would come within an inch of my life to achieve.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.820]   That's how much it mattered to me.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.140]   And when I pressure test through those four questions,
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.740]   through that synthesizing risk,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.060]   I was like, it's a no brainer to go on.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.980]   So why does it matter?
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.260]   Why does that decision matter?
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.180]   Because when we are pursuing really hard things
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.740]   that take a long time,
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.100]   you're going to take incoming external and internal,
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.580]   the voice in your head, people around you
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.180]   that are going to make you want to turn back.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.740]   So if you haven't already processed risk,
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.860]   you don't remember.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.620]   And because you've done it at the beginning of the journey,
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.660]   like, wait a minute, I already asked myself
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.940]   how I would handle if this didn't work out,
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.060]   and I'm okay with it.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.460]   It's the memory that you went through
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.820]   that risk synthesis operation, exercise rather,
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.420]   that sustains you.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.340]   Let's talk about a little bit what plan B means.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.940]   Sometimes people think plan B means risk mitigation,
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.820]   but I already said plan A incorporates risk mitigation.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:21.780]   You've already gone through it.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.580]   What plan B and what the science shows is,
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.140]   plan B is not about de-risking anything.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.420]   Plan B is a way for you to achieve your subordinate goal.
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.980]   So let's use it to anyone out there listening
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.980]   who wants to be a musician,
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.580]   but they have a crappy job that they hate.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.420]   But you're like, you know what?
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.060]   My dad always said I shouldn't be a musician,
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.660]   but I don't care, I'm going to tell him to F him,
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.100]   and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to be a musician.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.580]   I'm going to work really hard until I get on that band.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.660]   However, if it doesn't work out, I do have a plan B.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.260]   I'm going to go work at Bob's Record Store
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.580]   because I'm always perusing the aisles
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.100]   and he thinks I'm really smart.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.380]   That's your subordinate goal,
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.380]   which is to get a job different than the one you have, right?
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.180]   In the music sector, but very different being a musician
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.020]   than working at Bob's Record Store.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.340]   And what the study and the science shows
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.820]   is that plan B is actually an alternative way
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.540]   for you to relieve the pain and discomfort
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.980]   of pursuing your goals.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.420]   So there are two ways to get that done.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.460]   I can either win, succeed on plan A,
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.340]   or I can go for my lesser subordinate goal,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.140]   which is going to leave me unhappy.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.020]   And then the last piece of interesting research
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.420]   that came out of Wharton in 2014 was they found that
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.460]   just the mere contemplation of having a plan B,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.020]   Bob's Record Store, is enough to ensure
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.980]   you will never be a musician.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.060]   Just thinking about it.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.900]   And what they also found in the research,
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.620]   just having that insidious thought
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.260]   of working in that record store
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.060]   is going to dramatically reduce your desire
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.500]   to ever be a musician.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.340]   So it's two things.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.100]   You won't succeed and you won't care as much anymore.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.740]   That was a lot to unpack, Chris.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.580]   Yeah, I'm just thinking like, it's hard for some people,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.580]   especially maybe someone like myself,
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.500]   where I'm like always thinking about all the outcomes,
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.340]   all the options to not have a plan B.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.620]   But is having a plan B different
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.580]   than knowing that a plan B exists?
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.420]   There is.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.260]   I love that you said that.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.660]   That's such a smart way to put it.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.740]   Having a plan B is very different
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.740]   than the peace of knowing a plan B is out there for you.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.020]   And you don't need to return to it
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.060]   because you've already at the beginning of the journey
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.900]   in pursuit of plan A, identified what it is.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.700]   Like it does not need to be crystallized
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.100]   because you'll know you'll get a job somewhere,
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.580]   not Bob's particularly.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.220]   But if I'm having dinner with a friend and I'm like,
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.220]   I'm going all in, I'm becoming a musician.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.060]   And they're like, yeah, and if it doesn't work out,
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.580]   you can just go work at Bob's Records.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.300]   And it's like, oh, well now that I know that's an option,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.100]   I assume it wouldn't be fair to say,
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.620]   I can never become a musician again
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.380]   because I've now heard that there is a thing.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.940]   Or is it more when you start to say, okay,
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.860]   yeah, that guy, he's right.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.820]   I could just do this.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.220]   That's going to be fine.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.620]   I'm trying to think how do you as a optimizer
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.380]   thinking through all the options still make sure you
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.940]   aren't putting your primary goal at risk
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.380]   by just thinking about them?
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.820]   Well, it's a great question.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.940]   And so studies showed when you did introduce
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.500]   the idea of thinking about,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.540]   I think the difference is all about sequencing.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.860]   If you had that dinner with your buddy
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.700]   who was a little skeptical, like, hey, Chris,
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.980]   you're kind of delusional.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.980]   You sort of suck too.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.780]   Your guitar playing isn't any good.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.900]   Unlikely, right?
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.420]   If you had yet to do what I said
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.780]   at the beginning of this conversation
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.220]   and have that risk synthesis process, right?
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.420]   That would have been the first time
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.740]   that somebody was now intruding into your thoughts.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.980]   And then you get defensive, like,
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.860]   well, I could always go work at Bob's, right?
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.100]   But if you had already done the beginning,
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.780]   like you're not even hearing it.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.740]   Like it does not matter.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.860]   You're fearless and you're impervious
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.180]   because you already are self-contained.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.300]   I already know what I'm going to do.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.740]   And I don't care what you say.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.420]   It's not registering.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.860]   But if you hadn't already done that work on plan A,
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.300]   if it wasn't part of your plan A,
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.580]   you would be susceptible to it.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.580]   So this can sound like semantics,
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.940]   but I'm 100% convinced it's not semantics
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.340]   because the research shows it.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.260]   But you ask a great question is how to delineate
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.900]   between having already once thought through it
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.860]   versus having it at the table
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.580]   while you're going after plan A.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.420]   I'll give it to you in a practical setting.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.300]   There's some stuff I put in this book
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.100]   that I can't read, that I cringe at.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.700]   It's so deeply personal.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.260]   A couple of weeks before it got published,
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.220]   I was going for a walk
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.820]   and I was having a low serotonin moment.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.060]   And I repeated on me, like,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.620]   why did I put that in the book?
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.100]   Why did I put that in the book?
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.540]   Should I go change it?
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.900]   And then I was like, wait a second.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.100]   We already went through this, Matt,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.380]   at the beginning of the journey.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.420]   You put it in the book because you're pretty sure
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.340]   somebody out there who's reading it right now
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.900]   is depressed and hopeless.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.340]   And they're gonna read between the lines
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.020]   of what you wrote in that sentence.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.340]   And it may change the trajectory of their life.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.980]   You've already made the decision.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.820]   That's the difference.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.820]   And then I've already gone through, all right.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.580]   So it gets published and amplified in ways
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.620]   that I didn't really intend.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.540]   Like I'll live with it.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.260]   But the benefit of helping somebody out there
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.580]   read that sentence is worth it.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.340]   So again, nuance, but not semantics.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.820]   - And when I think about this idea of,
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.740]   okay, go all in on this thing.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.460]   You can be impervious to the feedback
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.100]   that maybe it won't work 'cause you've committed.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.180]   You've metaphorically burnt your boat.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.580]   Does that necessarily mean you have to commit
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.860]   to the full goal all at once?
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.740]   Or I'll give a concrete example that we talked about
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.060]   for two minutes before we got started was,
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.580]   I have this vision and this is the first time
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.620]   I think I'm sharing it on the podcast.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.980]   So it's kind of fun.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.220]   There's AARP, this thing that everyone knows,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.340]   oh, my parents are retired.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.580]   They joined this organization
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.100]   and they have all these great things
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.500]   and they've created a community of reasons
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.820]   that you would join a membership program for something.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.500]   I don't see something like that
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.540]   for the millennial who likes experiences.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.820]   They're not gonna join AARP,
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.900]   though I have in the past said you can for deals.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.420]   Even as a not old person retired, you could join.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.740]   But I thought, oh, what if I start something
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.380]   that could be a valuable membership
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.740]   that I hope people get value out of
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.940]   related to all the hacks.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.860]   So it's an idea I have.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.380]   I haven't gone all in on it yet, right?
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.460]   I haven't even said I'm gonna do it until right now,
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.500]   but do I need to commit to this is going to be
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.620]   a massive thing to effectively burn the boat?
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.180]   Or could I say, hey, I'm thinking of starting this.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.540]   Now I've at least created some public accountability.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.540]   Or maybe I create it and I say,
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.100]   here's where you can sign up.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.820]   I haven't built it all out to everything
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.700]   everyone might want.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.940]   Maybe only a handful of you listening wanna join
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.820]   with a few aspects of it.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.340]   How much do you have to commit to your grand vision
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.620]   to have burnt your boat, so to speak?
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.340]   - Well, I would argue that everything you just said
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.700]   is not your plan A yet,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.940]   because you're still in the formation phase.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.340]   So I think we get to define when it becomes a plan A.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.900]   It's about crossing the thresholds of saying,
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.420]   I am going to do everything I can to manifest this.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.060]   And you and the language you've used are not there yet.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.060]   It's all about our personal comfort level
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.340]   with risk and commitment
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.980]   and where it ranks with your other priorities.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.660]   So we are allowed to play and toy
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.860]   and the book I talk about this,
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.300]   I go pretty far down the road
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.980]   before I decide whether this is the thing.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.580]   And I don't mind having goals that are in parallel
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.020]   and sometimes in conflict, right?
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.180]   I became a lawyer who goes to law school,
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.140]   gets an offer from Skadden Arps, you know?
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.180]   And then I'm like, no, I don't wanna be a lawyer.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.660]   And then I never even took the bar exam.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.740]   Plan A and burning the boats is not about like dogmatic,
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.220]   rigid, forcing yourself to like fully commit
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.300]   to everything that comes into your head.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.420]   It's but when you've decided, Chris,
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.860]   that you're doing this membership program,
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.300]   which by the way is a great idea
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.740]   and I'll sign up right now
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.180]   without even knowing a single benefit
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.820]   because the way you hack everything feels valuable to me.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.420]   This conversation is already fun.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.460]   So, you know, I'm all in already.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.180]   Hopefully that escalates your commitment,
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.100]   but it is not your plan A yet.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.660]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.660]   - I've already decided, I've burnt the boat.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.580]   I'm all in on all the hacks, right?
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.860]   Like it's my full-time thing.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.820]   I left my company, job, everything.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.300]   This is it.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.540]   Do you actually need to burn the boats
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.660]   on all the small projects in your life
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.060]   and commit to a plan A?
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.220]   Or is it really more a higher order thing
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.100]   for one or two projects in your life,
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.740]   your professional career, your relationships?
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.300]   How do I think about it on that spectrum?
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.740]   - I actually don't render an opinion
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.500]   on the number of plan A's we can have
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.260]   because I think the joy of living,
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.460]   at least as I've identified it,
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.740]   is in the perpetual pursuit of these growth opportunities
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.700]   that stretch me, that make me uncomfortable
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.340]   and they tend to be operating simultaneously.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.180]   What I do though is I try to consolidate my gains
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.460]   because if I'm jumping from thing to thing
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.740]   and then I look behind me
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.060]   and I see a sea of unfinished projects
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.260]   and a lot of hurt people who were like,
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.180]   "Matt, where'd you go?
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.220]   You were so into this a year ago."
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.700]   That begins to chip away at my self-esteem, right?
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.500]   I'm not proud of my behavior.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.540]   So I try to hold myself accountable
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.580]   to scaling and optimizing.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.660]   Things get easier the third, fourth time you do it.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.420]   But I don't think it matters how many plan A's you have.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.620]   It's really about once it becomes a plan A,
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.500]   how do you increase the likelihood you will be successful?
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.860]   That's all my book is about.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.740]   How do I put the odds in your favor
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.620]   once you've identified this thing as a plan A?
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.780]   Not your only plan A, but a plan A.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.460]   You can have 17 plan A's, just zero plan B's.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.700]   - I'm having this conversation in my head
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.700]   of whether the mere existence of multiple plan A's
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.900]   is plan B's.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.780]   - I gave you the framework before,
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.300]   which is a fun question.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.460]   A plan B is by definition a way to achieve
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.620]   the subordinate goal of plan A.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.860]   So that's how it becomes a plan B.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.900]   That's why the musician and Bob's Record Store
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.460]   is a perfect way, 'cause both give him a new job,
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.340]   but they're very different.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.740]   So as long as you're 17, or your membership club,
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.180]   your podcast, they're like very hard things
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.860]   that require total, utter commitment.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.780]   - For me, I think I try to have a few number of things
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.660]   because I just personally can't manage
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.460]   lots of projects at once.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.380]   Which goes back to something you said in the book,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.340]   you talk about how to figure out what you're good at
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.980]   and accept that you're not good at everything.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.460]   It took me a lot of time to process this
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.100]   and I'll shout out my time at Wealthfront.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.740]   As a product manager, I realized there are parts
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.020]   of being a product manager that I'm just not good at.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.020]   And I realized that not as early, but early enough.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.700]   And I think it's hard for people.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.140]   So I'm curious if you have any tactics for people
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.940]   to realize it and accept it,
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.420]   because I think it's so easy to assume
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.460]   that if you're good at something,
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.100]   you can be good at everything.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.780]   And it's very hard to be self-critical,
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.700]   but I guess both, how can you find it?
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.100]   And maybe what are some things you could say
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.460]   to encourage people that learning the things
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.340]   you're not good at is actually a valuable thing to learn?
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.740]   - There's a concept in land use and zoning
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.900]   that relates to property.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.940]   And it's to ensure that property is always put
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.060]   to its best use based on the current context.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.060]   So it's called highest and best use.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.580]   To make that less abstract, a warehouse in Tribeca in 1920,
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.260]   the highest and best use of that warehouse
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.380]   was as a slaughterhouse.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.620]   In 2020, Taylor Swift is hanging out there
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.340]   with her private elevator, right?
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.260]   Like the property changes.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.500]   I look at myself like a piece of property
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.260]   that is always changing due to its context,
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.620]   except the context is not external, it's internal.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.580]   I am an amalgam of all the things I've accomplished
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.500]   prior to today.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.220]   Oh, well, now I'm a guy who was on "Shark Tank."
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.540]   I know how to do TV.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.580]   Now I'm a person who teaches at Harvard Business School.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.660]   I know how to teach.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.500]   Now I wrote a book.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.540]   Now I'm an author.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.620]   I have things to say.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.420]   I ask myself every single week, sometimes every day,
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.100]   what is the highest and best use of Matt Higgins
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.900]   now that he has accomplished whatever it is he did yesterday?
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.420]   Whatever it is I've now achieved through my trauma,
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.060]   part of the highest and best use of me now
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.580]   is to share painful things that some people don't talk about
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.460]   because that's very valuable.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.300]   By focusing on the affirmative and asking yourself,
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.780]   anybody listening right now,
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.740]   what's the highest and best use of you,
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.620]   rather than be a negative of saying,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.180]   you begin to cull the herd of opportunity and say like,
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.260]   well, I mean, I could do Excel, but I'm not that good at it.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.620]   And by the way, why do I want to be?
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.580]   And say, right, I'm a good communicator
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.660]   and I can synthesize complicated information
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.820]   and I could operate a company,
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.820]   but it's not the highest and best use of Matt Higgins
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.620]   is to operate a company with 200 people,
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.580]   even though I've done it before.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.940]   So I don't know why people are afraid of this.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.140]   Like, why do you want to be good at everything?
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.700]   Don't you want to be great at a few things?
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.740]   But besides, if you ask the question I just gave you,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.100]   the answer will lead you to where
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.340]   you should be spending your energy
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.060]   and you don't have to make a value judgment.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.220]   There's no value in the statement I just gave
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.300]   about the highest and best use.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.540]   It just is true.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.340]   That's my number one piece of advice.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.900]   - Sounds like stop reframing, what am I not good at?
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.540]   And just focus on what you're great at.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.340]   - Yeah, and now as I say this,
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.180]   and you bring up a great point,
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.260]   I find it's one of the hardest things
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.740]   for founders to accept is those limitations
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.940]   because they don't know what it means to be a CEO, right?
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.780]   When you're a founder,
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.100]   you suddenly go from an idea creator to an implementer
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.340]   to a capital convener,
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.900]   and then all of a sudden you run an operating business.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.020]   So you believe that being a good CEO, good founder,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.180]   is having the capacity to run an operating business
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.420]   and do everything.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.660]   And they don't realize that actually being a good founder,
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.100]   good CEO, is the ability to identify talent
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.260]   that's better than you at each position
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.780]   and to render yourself obsolete wherever you possibly can.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.460]   But I find a lot of people struggle with this
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.620]   from an identity standpoint.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.740]   They feel like they need to be good at it
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.540]   only 'cause no one gave them an alternative definition.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.740]   Or even in the non-founder CEO world,
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.100]   I find that people often think
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.140]   that there's a prescribed path.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.620]   You do a job, you do it well,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.340]   and then you manage people doing it.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.060]   And I have met countless people that have realized
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.580]   that the best use of their time
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.140]   is not managing other people.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.580]   And other people, similarly, are phenomenal at it,
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.220]   even if they aren't a master of the skill of their industry
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.620]   or whatever the people that they manage do.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.460]   So if you're a designer,
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.780]   you might not be the best designer in the world,
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.100]   but you could actually be the best design manager.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.620]   - I find a lot of people feel, for whatever reason,
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.460]   they wanna be branded like an operator.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.580]   They're insecure about not being an operator,
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.940]   which fundamentally, being an operator
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   or managing people is being a very good therapist.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.540]   And a lot of people don't have the patience
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.860]   or the EQ to be a therapist.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.700]   And so therefore,
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.300]   you're probably not gonna be a very good operator
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.060]   'cause it requires so much time and patience
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.300]   to get the most out of people.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.140]   But I find that scenario a lot.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.060]   People just get insecure
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.700]   about not being like an operator, an executor.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.540]   - Interesting.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.180]   I find that so many people think that management
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.380]   is the next step.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.100]   I'm excited when I hear stories of people
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.260]   that realize that wasn't the case and what they did.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.900]   And Google was one of the few companies
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.060]   that created alternative track
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.300]   for someone to just be very senior, very highly compensated,
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.860]   but not be a manager.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.660]   And I see that trend picking up
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.940]   at least at a lot of companies in Silicon Valley.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.100]   And I hope that continues to permeate itself
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.420]   through all industries.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.500]   - It's possible to separate influence and authority
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.780]   from like command control responsibility.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.620]   And it makes sense
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.220]   'cause most people are very bad managers.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.060]   So it makes sense
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.980]   that not everybody was born to be a manager.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.380]   - So while we're on the topic of things
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.340]   that we might not be good at, let's put that aside.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.780]   But let's talk about when things don't go right.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.260]   When you do fail,
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.860]   are there things that people should be doing?
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.540]   'Cause look, once you've committed to a plan A,
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.300]   you've burned the boats, you're on the way,
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.060]   it's inevitable that things will go wrong along the way.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.500]   Talk about the fear to get started, the fear to commit.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.780]   But what about the challenges that come along the way,
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.020]   processing those failures?
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.540]   You wanna be a musician, you decide to go all in,
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.620]   you do your first gig, no one shows up, it's a disaster.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.220]   How would you advise someone to process that failure
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.220]   and continue pushing forward?
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.460]   Or maybe understand when they shouldn't?
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.100]   - Yeah, that's a big reason why I wrote this book
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.540]   because I have seen throughout my life,
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.660]   the same fact pattern play over and over again,
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.100]   which I don't quite understand
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.420]   why the universe is wired this way.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.940]   But the act of persistence
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.220]   is a tremendous predictor of future success.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.340]   The mere act of persisting and surviving another day
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.260]   will ultimately beget success,
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.900]   which doesn't make any sense, right?
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.740]   Like, what do you mean I just stay around another day,
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.180]   I just push through and then eventually I get what I want?
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.700]   But the answer is it's true.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.660]   And so I talk in the book about
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.420]   the most successful people I've seen
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.700]   would break through success.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.900]   If I try to discern like,
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.300]   what's the common fact pattern here?
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.100]   Come from all sorts of different fields,
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:39.940]   different walks of life.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.900]   The common fact pattern I see is when they face a setback,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.620]   they simply expand the definition of what success looks like
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.220]   to accommodate that particular setback.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.500]   It sounds almost delusional.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.780]   It's like, I'm so glad that didn't work out
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.380]   because I never would have hired Bill.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.300]   And now that Bill's here, I'm gonna make a billion dollars.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.020]   And yet when they have a win,
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.620]   it enhances their self-esteem.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   So what's the point of saying that?
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.860]   It's very important how we process failure.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.060]   One, accept the fact that the goal is to continue,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:06.980]   is to survive.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.020]   So how do I survive?
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.020]   How do I keep going?
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.540]   And the number one thing you need to do to survive
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.220]   is to preserve your sense of self-worth.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.740]   It's something we don't like focus on,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.300]   but your number one objective when you have a setback
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.620]   is to ensure that particular failure does not become enmeshed
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.100]   with your permanent identity.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.140]   So number one, my process is I acknowledge that I failed.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.740]   So I remain intellectually honest.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.060]   Also by acknowledging it verbally and otherwise,
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.740]   it loses its power over you.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.340]   The fear of even acknowledging it
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.660]   is the thing that kind of is half the battle
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.940]   and being able to be like, yeah, I failed, whatever.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.660]   But then number two, I am not a failure.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.220]   Like I just refuse to be identified.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.060]   And that's the point I made
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.860]   about these outrageously successful people.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.820]   It's like, it just does not penetrate
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.540]   their reality distortion field.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.940]   So number two, I'm not a failure.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.540]   Three, but what is a failure trying to teach me?
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.980]   How do I extract maximum value from this failure?
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.060]   Back to my point about survival and persistence.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.860]   In the failure is the answers to your future persistence,
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.940]   your survival, and you have to mine it
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.380]   and sit with it for a bit.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.820]   And then the fourth piece is to never look at it again
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.220]   once you've extracted value.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.940]   And I'm not great at that.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.500]   And again, I wrote my book, so I'd read my book.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.540]   So anybody here saying, wow, that's great,
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.380]   but I can't do it,
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.220]   understand that I struggle with this too,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.540]   but I know it's true.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.060]   So while I struggle with it,
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.660]   I remind myself that is the way to do it.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.900]   But those four simple, easy steps, and then go forward.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.780]   Back to our point about the musician,
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.380]   like when should he give up?
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.180]   The answer is like never.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.900]   It's just like, find a different way.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.580]   Find a different way to be in the band.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.820]   Maybe you're not the lead guitarist,
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.060]   but you're in the damn band.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:36.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   And just like, never stop.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.820]   It doesn't mean never iterate, never course correct.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.740]   That's like, you have to do those things,
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.540]   but just never stop.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.780]   And that's why it's so important
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.260]   to have this plan A construct
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.540]   and to accept the idea of the way
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.780]   you're gonna get what you want
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.460]   is to not have the plan B
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.660]   and to have processed the risk
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.100]   at the beginning of the journey,
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.220]   because the way to be ultimately successful in life
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.260]   is to never give up.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.540]   I know it sounds so corny and it's in all the books,
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.100]   but there's a reason there are cliches, right?
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.420]   'Cause they tend to be true.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.660]   You just don't stop.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.700]   - I have a specific anecdote from researching podcasting,
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.540]   which is someone always asks like,
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.980]   how do you be a top podcast?
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.820]   And I was like, well,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.020]   I have one piece of advice that's very easy.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.220]   There are 4 million podcasts.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.980]   And if you filter the 4 million down by podcasts
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.820]   that have done more than 10 episodes ever
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.860]   and have published in the last 10 days,
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.020]   you delete 96% of podcasts.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.740]   So it's like, if you wanna be in the top 5%
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.380]   of all podcasts that have been created,
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.340]   not the top 5% that are active,
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.660]   but of all, you literally just have to produce 10 episodes
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.220]   and keep going and that's it.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.900]   So you're not wrong.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.700]   - We don't wanna accept that for some reason.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.540]   I don't know why.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.900]   I mean, because it's really hard.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.860]   And there are moments like,
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.340]   I'm going through something right now.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.100]   There's always moments when I think
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.180]   that can't possibly be true.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.020]   It can't be that if I just stay the course
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.140]   and continue to make course corrections and refinements
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.100]   that ultimately I'm gonna get what I want.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.340]   No matter what, despite everything I'm saying right now,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.780]   it gets bleak for me.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.220]   And I cannot believe that statement is true.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.140]   And yet I just force myself to believe it.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.780]   And in the end, it is always true.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.700]   It's just, I don't know how it's gonna play out.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.380]   Even my book, when you open my book,
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.580]   anybody out there who reads it,
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.700]   they'll tell you just a funny story.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.340]   I did a $200 million SPAC during a pandemic.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.300]   I knew that the industry would probably turn,
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.340]   but I thought I could do a great deal
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.580]   and I could get it done and I would learn public markets
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.140]   and maybe I could outrun the timing
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.900]   and I could just show how it could be done better.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.660]   Long story short, so that was the opening of my book.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.180]   And in doing my SPAC,
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.020]   I had to will every part of this to existence,
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.220]   including the IPO.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.860]   I IPO'd at the height of COVID and it almost fell apart
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.900]   and I had to just stay up all night and to get it done.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.740]   I didn't feel good, but I just kept working through it.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.020]   I rang the bell the next day.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.060]   Within two days, I had double pneumonia
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.180]   and my oscillator, the oxygen was dropping.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.540]   I'm like, wow, now I may die because I did this,
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.620]   but I got it done.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.500]   And then I got a deal done and on and on and on.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.180]   And then ultimately the market turned
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.100]   and the SPAC fell apart.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.260]   That was the beginning of my book.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.820]   Okay, I'm gonna have to acknowledge a little failure
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.740]   in the beginning,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.540]   but the good thing is I have my TV show.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.060]   I have a "Shark Tank" spinoff.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.020]   I'm gonna open the book about my "Shark Tank" spinoff
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.860]   and tell everybody how I'm partnering with Mark Burnett.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.020]   I'm leveling up.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.580]   It's the whole premise of my book.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:13.860]   I'm gonna get that done.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.100]   So I write that and then the TV show gets canceled
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.180]   before it ever airs.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.380]   My editor is like,
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.980]   I think we gotta rewrite the beginning of the book.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.380]   And I'm like, no, I think that's the point of the book.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.340]   They're like, this is how it goes.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.420]   And you know what?
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.260]   When we look back,
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.580]   if I did a podcast with you three years from now,
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.220]   I guarantee you there's gonna be exponential values
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.620]   somehow that came from me
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.580]   knowing how to bring a company public.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.140]   And two, my TV experience is gonna result
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.380]   in the next iteration of "Shark Tank" that I created.
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.820]   It's just the way the universe works.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.060]   But when you're in the middle of it and it's bleak,
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.940]   sometimes it all doesn't make sense,
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.300]   which is why you need the faith.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.500]   But if you just burn the boats,
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.220]   it's gonna play out in your favor.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:54.100]   With travel back on the calendar and my kid in preschool,
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.060]   I need an easy way to optimize my immune system
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.540]   and get some extra energy every day,
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.380]   which is why I kickstart my day
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.460]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.100]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.620]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.340]   because I think it's the best option
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.220]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.940]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.660]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.980]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.940]   probiotics and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.420]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.580]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.780]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.300]   and energized for the day,
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.820]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.580]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.620]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.420]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.500]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.340]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.820]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.700]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.340]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.020]   to take ownership over your health
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.980]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.260]   As the weather warms up and flowers start to bloom,
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.380]   it is the perfect time to take a fresh look
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.900]   at your financial planning.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.740]   If you've been meaning to get life insurance
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.160]   but have been putting it off, now is the time.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.860]   With Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.140]   it's quick and easy to help protect your family's future
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.380]   so you can get back to enjoying life,
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.220]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.460]   for this episode.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.660]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.900]   to help you get a high-quality, surprisingly affordable
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.940]   term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.700]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.860]   I actually went online to compare prices

[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.800]   And how do you go up against this
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.600]   as what you said, a paranoid risk taker?
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   You're seeing all these things fall apart.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.520]   Sorry about that.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.360]   - Thanks, yeah.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.000]   Well, I'm just trying to practice what I preach
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   and model what it looks like.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.840]   - But how does being a paranoid risk taker
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.460]   play into all of this?
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.020]   - I spent a lot of time agonizing
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.600]   of whether I should or should not do the SPAC,
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.940]   all the things that could play out.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.980]   Exactly what played out was on the list.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.540]   So, I was able to go all in on plan A.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.440]   Plan A is not a delusional belief
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.280]   that you're gonna get what you're entitled to.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.160]   It's the utter commitment to the goal.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.800]   The only way, that SPAC had any shot
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.880]   of becoming an IPO or getting a deal done
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.300]   is if I had fully committed to it.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.280]   If I had an ounce of plan B as I was going it,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.960]   I wouldn't have gotten as far as I would have gotten.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.840]   And the same thing with the TV show,
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.240]   it wouldn't even gotten remotely close.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.840]   So, as a paranoid risk taker,
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.120]   it's especially important for me to have processed
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.820]   all the risk at the beginning of the journey,
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.700]   because then I would have these intrusive thoughts
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.140]   that never would have enabled me to get it done.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.920]   They're not at all mutually exclusive.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.360]   It's actually more important for a risk adverse person
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.600]   to do what I'm saying and to go through that exercise
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.760]   and process everything.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.080]   'Cause when I was taking on water
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.200]   through both of those experiences,
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.440]   I kept remembering, like, you've gone through this,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.300]   you knew this could happen, attack.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.340]   Like, keep going forward
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.600]   and don't be afraid.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.120]   You already know you have the tools necessary
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.800]   to handle whatever happens.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.640]   - Earlier in the conversation,
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.000]   you talked about goal setting.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.400]   You've just walked through some big projects you worked on.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.480]   Is there a framework you use to set goals
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.240]   in your personal or professional life?
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.860]   - Yes, I think if you're gonna commit
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.880]   to a life of perpetual pursuit
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.320]   of bigger and bigger opportunities,
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.480]   and you're gonna put yourself in uncomfortable positions,
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.560]   you could find yourself drowning or overwhelmed
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.480]   or have taken on way too much.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.380]   So I always say, this also helps me with processing risk
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.180]   and going all in on plan A.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.260]   I believe it's important to identify
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.420]   what can I not live without, right?
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.200]   If I lost everything,
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.100]   what do I absolutely need to maintain
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.040]   in order to have a degree of peace and happiness?
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.540]   And as you become more successful,
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.420]   your relationship with risk actually increases
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.500]   'cause you have more to lose.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.980]   You get more afraid to take bigger swings.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.020]   I find this with colleagues all the time, like,
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.080]   well, now I have the big job and the big salary.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.860]   Now I'm even more afraid to take on risk.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.380]   And so I think it's actually very important
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.180]   to define your needs as narrowly as possible
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.140]   the more successful you become,
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.360]   and then try to let that base case not change.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.820]   So I draw a hard line of boundaries around my kids,
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.560]   my spouse, who's my best friend,
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.940]   a few basic things that I need.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.820]   We're always saying like,
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.040]   what's the smallest apartment we could live in?
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.100]   So I'm not afraid of everything going to crap.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.080]   And so that's how I set objectives.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.980]   And when I feel like I've taken on a lot,
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.260]   that something may fail,
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.860]   then I'm always like, well, it doesn't matter
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.020]   because I know what I need
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.140]   if everything were to go to hell.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.620]   And I think people don't do that.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.980]   People don't ask like, what's the minimum?
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.700]   They focus more on what they want,
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.240]   not what could they live with
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.500]   if they don't get what they want
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.540]   or what they have is taken away from them.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.500]   - You talked about things going wrong.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.020]   You've had experiences in your life
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.220]   that have dealt with all kinds of crises
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.780]   from the biggest stage
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.560]   to lots of business operational things.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.660]   Maybe talk a little bit about your experience
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.940]   dealing with big crises and how you manage that.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.220]   Both internally and externally.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.460]   - Yeah, for those that don't know,
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.660]   I was the press secretary to the mayor of New York
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.380]   on September 11th, 2001.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.300]   And then I went and helped oversee
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.980]   the rebuilding of the World Trade Center
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.180]   as chief operating officer.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.660]   So I spent two years at ground zero
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.260]   from the moment that first plane struck the tower.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.320]   And so the most extraordinary, complicated
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.140]   and gut-wrenching crisis maybe in American history.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:13.180]   And my first takeaway that I learned from that experience
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.860]   was how showing up is half of everything
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.140]   and how people get that wrong.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.900]   They get the wrong in every context, right?
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.740]   CEOs, leaders, you flail.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:26.220]   That most people are looking for just symbolically
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.620]   and actually for you to show up
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.940]   and identify that you're here, that you're in charge.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.020]   So whatever situation I find myself in,
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.260]   even in a personal crisis, I say, am I showing up?
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.060]   And showing up personally means am I facing the thing
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.300]   that is the crisis, right?
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.420]   Back to my earlier statement,
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.620]   if I had one tattoo, it would be face everything.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.820]   So showing up is number one.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.320]   Number two is back to what's the worst possible thing
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.020]   that could happen in this crisis
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.860]   and how would I deal with it if it played out?
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.540]   And what's the likelihood of that playing out?
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.540]   I ask myself those same questions when I'm in a crisis.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.180]   And then three, I look for the silver lining very early.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.860]   This law of physics that every action
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.580]   has an equal and opposite reaction
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.980]   is very much on display in a crisis.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.580]   No matter what happens in this world,
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.740]   when there is a crisis and something bad happens,
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.460]   a portal is gonna open up to a parallel universe
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.400]   where something good is happening as a result.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.220]   Sometimes when that involves pain and suffering,
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.220]   it's very hard to accept
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.540]   and you have to just wait for that to materialize.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.700]   But when life or death is not on the line,
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.380]   you should give yourself permission to say,
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:27.660]   okay, I just lost my job, which is a big crisis,
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.420]   but what's the portal that just opened up
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:30.740]   to a parallel universe?
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.400]   Oh, well, I have nothing to lose.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.500]   Now I'm willing to go all in on being that musician,
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   my plan A, right?
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.800]   Now I don't have to settle anymore for Bob's Record Store.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.320]   And so I do think, again, not in life or death situations,
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.680]   but every time I have a crisis,
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.040]   I get excited by what's the portal,
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.760]   where am I going, what's gonna happen in my life
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.080]   as a result of what just happened?
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.240]   And there's another way to say it.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.920]   Rahm Emanuel said at Mayor of Chicago,
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.440]   "Never let a crisis go to waste."
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.160]   But it's another way of saying what I'm saying.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.920]   But I do talk in a book too about,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.120]   one of the interesting things when you look about crisis
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.040]   and sometimes you assess how you performed
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.960]   and if you admire how you performed,
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.000]   often the reason is because you had clarity
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.240]   of decision-making and you act decisively
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.560]   'cause you had few choices.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.880]   A lot of my book is about how do you migrate
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.360]   the benefits of crisis decision-making in times of peace
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.320]   so that no one wants to have cortisol
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.340]   flowing through their stomach
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.720]   in order to behave effectively.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.840]   But there is something to be said
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.800]   for the clarity of crisis decision-making
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.160]   and applying it to everyday life.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.320]   - It brings up a good question.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.000]   Let's take someone who's at a job, they don't love it,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.040]   they're trying to figure out what to do next.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.560]   Do you think the average person is spending too much time
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.220]   trying to make that decision or too little?
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:39.220]   - I think the average person is spending too much time
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.780]   looking to settle to escape the pain
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.620]   of the current situation and not enough time
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.220]   believing that the right situation is out there
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.220]   and confidently pursuing it.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.060]   I think the same is true of relationships too.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.620]   We wanna relieve the pain of the status quo
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.140]   and therefore we settle and not enough time
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.200]   trying to identify what's the right situation.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.780]   So we tend to repeat the same bad patterns, I believe.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.220]   Most people fall into that trap.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.340]   And that's because you don't value yourself enough.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.860]   You either believe the right situation isn't out there
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.180]   or you believe you don't deserve it,
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.420]   especially true in personal relationships.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   You just like don't know or you don't think you're worthy.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.500]   - Well, on the professional side,
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.140]   I feel quite amped right now.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.500]   I already did the plan A, went all in on the macro idea
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.220]   of what I'm building here, but I'm ready to start.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.900]   - You already got your first customer in here
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.900]   and it was effortless and your acquisition cost was zero.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.180]   - Just to be clear, I have had two listeners or readers
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.780]   use this feature on the newsletter.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.700]   I think both of them said,
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.660]   "I'll pay $100 a year for a membership.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.660]   You just have to build it."
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.180]   So technically Matt, unfortunately you are customer three.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.420]   Huge shout out to customers one and two.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.740]   - Chris, I have news for you.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.460]   I'm willing to pay 400 for the premium membership.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:47.300]   - Okay.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.460]   - So I am technically still the first premium member
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.100]   as I have upsold myself.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.220]   (laughing)
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.700]   - Tier two.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.420]   - See, this is what happens when we commit to plan A
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.320]   publicly on a podcast.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.500]   - So I'm excited to do that.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.280]   I guess I should probably commit myself
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.740]   to this even further and say,
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.060]   if you go to allthehacks.com/join,
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.780]   I'm gonna put up a page where anyone listening
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.160]   can join a membership that I will create.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.060]   And the one thing that I will commit to having in it now,
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.020]   there's not a lot of features,
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.700]   is I'm gonna do a once a month call just for members,
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.020]   Zoom call, you can join, ask anything,
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.420]   we can talk about anything.
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.540]   I'm not gonna record it.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.020]   I'm not gonna put it out to everyone.
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.280]   We'll at least do that.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.300]   The goal in the long run is to build a real membership,
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.300]   to have perks and benefits.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.300]   I have some crazy ideas on travel.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.200]   I'll talk about them in that first Zoom call.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.600]   But if you go to that page,
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   I will set something up by the time this airs.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.000]   - Wait, can we use this as a case study though?
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.440]   'Cause one thing we didn't get into
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.680]   is something I talk into my book
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.600]   about the loneliness of being on the bleeding edge
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.960]   and what happens when you have a revelation
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.160]   or an epiphany like you've had with this membership idea,
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.480]   which I think is fantastic.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.880]   But let's say I was neutral.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.520]   What happens is the relationship
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.640]   between the magnitude of an opportunity
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.580]   and the amount of data there is to support it is inverse,
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.760]   which makes sense, right?
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.440]   If you have a really great idea
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.340]   and that only you see because you're so early,
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.460]   there's not gonna be any data out there to support it.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:07.640]   And two, if you rely on your friend group
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.480]   or family group or whatever to validate it,
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.820]   they're not gonna be able to see what you see
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.820]   'cause it's your epiphany.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.380]   At the same time, those are actually confirmatory
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.500]   that it's a big opportunity,
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.740]   unless you're crazy or delusional,
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.180]   because only you are putting the pieces together.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.900]   And I think what happens is oftentimes
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.180]   where people sit where you sit,
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.860]   wait a second, why is there only AARP?
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.180]   There should be a membership group.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.540]   What is it about being 65
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.860]   that makes you wanna belong things?
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:29.700]   That's not true.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.080]   I would love a group where I get benefits, right?
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.820]   What happens a lot of times, Chris,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.900]   is now a person will road test it with their peer group
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.060]   or their friend group.
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:39.700]   And if they've surrounded themselves
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.380]   with people who are risk adverse,
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.140]   or maybe they don't have their best interest at heart,
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.260]   the idea dies with those groups.
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.080]   So I talk in my book a lot about,
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.820]   make sure that when you have a nascent idea
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:50.820]   that you one, cradle it,
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.340]   but two, consult agendalist supporters
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.380]   or what I call pragmatic optimists,
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.860]   people who are wired to be optimistic, but pragmatic,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.500]   so they can give you real data.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.620]   But it's really important to sit with this idea
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.060]   that like when you have a big opportunity, a big idea,
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.940]   there isn't gonna be the data
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.460]   or the affirmation to support it in the early days
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.380]   and don't let it die at that point.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.900]   'Cause the best innovations in life are gut sandwiches.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.040]   They began with intuition like you just had,
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.900]   a little bit of data, AARP, the thing exists,
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.340]   but you're gonna launch this based on intuition
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.700]   and my early membership fee of $400.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.580]   Last point on this,
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.580]   'cause Chris is about to start this journey.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.700]   My number one advice to you is opportunity,
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:30.100]   arrives before the tipping point of evidence.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.860]   So don't be afraid.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.940]   If you trust your instincts and your intuition,
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.020]   if it's a great idea, you'll figure it out
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.300]   the same way Chris is gonna figure out
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.900]   with his new membership group.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.980]   Do we have a name?
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.620]   - I mean, the whole thing's under all the hacks,
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.460]   so it's gonna be there.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.500]   We'll see where it evolves.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.340]   I have ideas of everyone joining
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.460]   can be a sub-agent of a travel agency.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.340]   People are gonna be able to build this with me.
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:51.300]   One other thing I'll add is a feature.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:54.500]   I'm gonna float to all members, the upcoming guests.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.620]   So you would have gotten a message that Matt's coming on,
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.940]   we're gonna talk about this.
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.140]   I'm gonna let you guys also be a part in
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.780]   what should we talk about with this person?
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.380]   What topics should we discuss?
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.020]   So I'm gonna bring you in as members
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.020]   to part of what we're building.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.780]   So there's a feature ad right now
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.900]   for members of this already announced
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.820]   by the time you hear it, membership.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.260]   - Exciting, I can't wait.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.100]   All right, awesome.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.420]   We did some work today.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.260]   - Love it.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.900]   So if anyone listening right now has a thing,
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.380]   whether it's a new career path, a new job, anything,
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.900]   my strong recommendation is to check out the book
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.220]   and maybe you can burn your own boat
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.180]   like I just did on this episode.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.580]   We're all in on a membership.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.900]   We'll see where it goes.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.620]   Where can people find anything about what you're working on?
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.300]   I know you've got some cool bonuses on the book online.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.340]   Where should people go?
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.100]   - Yeah, I have a website, burntheboatsbook.com.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.540]   I tend to spend a lot of time on LinkedIn.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.860]   So find me there.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.980]   If you read the book, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.140]   Feedback is amazing.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.380]   So Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Goodreads,
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.700]   wherever it is you spend your time, that would be great.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.980]   Also tells me which themes I should be building upon
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.820]   and expanding upon.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.660]   So thank you.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.020]   - So leave a review for the book.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.100]   Just like I always ask everyone
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.380]   to leave a review for the podcast.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.340]   I know it's really important.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.700]   I will go leave you a review after this.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.540]   Thanks for being here.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.380]   - Thank you.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.660]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.420]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.540]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.300]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.060]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.460]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.860]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.140]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.220]   That's it for this week.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.420]   I'll see you next week.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.200]   (electronic music)
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.120]   (electronic music)
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.040]   (electronic music)
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.100]   you
