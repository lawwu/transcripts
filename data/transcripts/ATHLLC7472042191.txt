[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.400]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.320]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I started this show
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.360]   almost two years ago because I love doing all the research
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.840]   to optimize every aspect of my life.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.280]   And I wanted a way to share that journey with you.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.320]   After the first dozen or so episodes,
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.600]   I knew this would be my full-time thing,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.400]   but somehow it took me another year and a half
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.440]   until I was ready to go all in.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.920]   Now, I am so glad that finally happened,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.240]   but why did it take me so long to commit
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.440]   to something I knew deep down inside I was ready for?
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.000]   Well, that is exactly what we're gonna talk about today.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.880]   And I'm joined by the perfect person
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.480]   for the conversation, Matt Higgins.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.200]   Matt grew up in poverty and dropped out of high school
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   at the age of 16, before going on to graduate
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.000]   from law school and then become the youngest press secretary
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   in New York City history during 9/11,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.620]   where he led the effort to rebuild
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.080]   the World Trade Center site,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.120]   before becoming the executive vice president
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.360]   of the New York Jets,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.880]   and then the vice chairman of the Miami Dolphins.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.120]   Matt was also a guest shark on "Shark Tank,"
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.160]   he teaches at Harvard Business School,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.080]   and through the investment firm he co-founded, RSC Ventures,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.520]   he's invested in some of America's most beloved brands.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.320]   So what does all this have to do with me
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.240]   taking too long to go all in on this podcast?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.120]   Well, Matt just published an incredible book
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.820]   that I wish I had been able to read a year ago,
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.480]   where he shares his framework to stop hedging
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   and unlock your full potential.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.560]   It's called "Burn the Boats."
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.080]   So today, we're gonna talk about why too many of us
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.560]   are driven by fear,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.120]   why we wait for the perfect moment to act,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.840]   and why so often we subconsciously construct a safety net
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.280]   or plan B that actually holds us back.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800]   But we're not just gonna talk about it,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.760]   we're gonna lay out an actionable playbook
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.660]   to overcome all these hesitations
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.920]   and burn your boats, as Matt says.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.340]   We'll also cover understanding your own motivations,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.840]   overcoming fear, processing failure,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.320]   managing crises, asking the right questions,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.440]   and a lot more.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.000]   Matt, thanks for being here.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600]   - Thanks for having me, I'm excited, Chris.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.480]   - It's funny, I read the front cover of the book
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.640]   before I opened it, before I dug into it,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.440]   and it's like, you can unleash your full potential,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.280]   all this, there's a lot of books
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.640]   that cover topics like that.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360]   "Awaken the Giant Within," Tony Robbins, all this stuff.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   What made you feel like we needed another book in here,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.800]   and what's gonna set this story apart?
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.840]   - That's a great question.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.320]   Well, big picture, I don't think there are new ideas
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.620]   in the universe, mostly they've all been discovered,
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.240]   but there's new packaging.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.760]   And when I read a lot of business books on the subject,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.780]   not disparaging anyone in particular,
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.720]   I do feel like they're written like reference manuals,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.040]   number one, and by the third chapter,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.120]   you've basically got the crux of it.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.480]   They're very repetitive,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.980]   and that's not how people learn information.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.480]   I'm a storyteller by heart,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.840]   was a journalist when I was a kid.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   I know how to explain, articulate, package stories.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.960]   And so I wanted to create a book that was very readable,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.160]   that was a business book, but masked as a memoir,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.280]   masked as a riveting historical fiction journey,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.640]   and sort of break the genre to some extent,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.400]   with the goal being you could read it
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.680]   from beginning to end in one setting,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.520]   and be left with a feeling of infinite possibility.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.440]   So packaging, to me, I think is actually very important.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.240]   Storytelling is very important.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.580]   And I've accumulated a lot of wisdom
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.040]   through a lot of heartbreak
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.100]   and a lot of incredible opportunities,
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.000]   and thought that I had something special to share.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.760]   - I think you're selling two parts of this short.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.160]   I think the idea of there being this plan B,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.440]   that there are benefits from not having and getting rid of,
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.980]   I think is a unique perspective I hadn't read before.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.760]   And so we're gonna get into that.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.240]   And then I think the second is you said it's a business book.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   I'm curious if this really is just for people
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.320]   running businesses, wanting to start a business,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.080]   'cause my perspective reading it
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.460]   was that it has a lot more broad applicability
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.540]   than just being for business people.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.560]   Like, it doesn't quite know what it wants to be,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.360]   but I would argue that business is just the tapestry,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.720]   or the canvas, rather,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   and that at the end of the day,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.680]   it's really just about anybody, which is everybody,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.080]   looking to unleash their potential.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.520]   - I heard you say this is for people who wanna break out.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.900]   They feel like the universe has a lot more in store for them
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.860]   but they keep finding obstacles.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.000]   So let's just jump in.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.160]   What do you think some of those common obstacles are
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.360]   that kind of hold people back from pushing forward?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.880]   - What I try to do with this book,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.240]   and had in my head the entire time, is show, don't tell.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.160]   Like, when I use that third person voice, Matthew,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.400]   like, you're at the center of the journey too much here.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.520]   You wanna show and illustrate rather than tell.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.560]   And a lot of books, I think, just tend to lecture you,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.760]   and then, therefore, it doesn't quite stick.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.520]   So that's a way of saying the boat, in my book,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.040]   historically, is meant to be literally the escape route.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.960]   That's how military strategists use it.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.520]   Burn the boats is literally burning your escape route.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.720]   In my case, the boat is meant to be a metaphor
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   for all the things in our lives that hold us back
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.400]   when we're at the threshold of doing something great,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.840]   something uncomfortable.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.320]   And a lot of that has to do first with internal issues
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.820]   that aren't really discussed.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.120]   Certainly, I feel like they're not discussed
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.980]   at my level enough, and that's imposter syndrome.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.640]   In my case, it was shame.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.480]   The metaphorical boat that I needed to burn first
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.120]   was the shame I carried around from the stigma
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.040]   of growing up in abject poverty
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.600]   and taking care of my mother who died when I was 26,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.880]   being a high school dropout, getting a GED.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.800]   There was all this shame that I carried
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.320]   that I didn't realize until life brought me to my knees
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.840]   that even though I had achieved
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.160]   a pretty significant level of success
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.360]   at an early age, objectively,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.080]   I hadn't really scratched the surface of my potential
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.200]   until a bunch of things happened in my life
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.800]   that brought me to my knees.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.560]   I was stripped away, and we can get into this.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.640]   And then I realized, oh, you haven't really
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.680]   done anything yet, right, like any kind of self-work.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.000]   And so a lot of the issues that we need to do,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.880]   the metaphorical boats for all of us are internal.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.200]   - How does someone who maybe hasn't even thought
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.520]   about what those things that are holding them back are
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.140]   even begin to identify them?
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.760]   Is there a process or questions you ask yourself
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.240]   to even start to understand that?
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.640]   - Yeah, I think self-awareness
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.520]   is the greatest arbitrage in the universe.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.680]   We're sort of taught that we should go to Barnes & Noble
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.180]   and buy my book or go on YouTube, watch TED Talk,
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.960]   and no one ever emphasizes like,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.640]   actually, the greatest upside in ROI you can have
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.160]   is self-awareness and reflecting what's going on inside you.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   So the first question, even when I'm doing a deal
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.240]   and I find that a founder or CEO or entrepreneurs
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.840]   help resistant, I try to identify, what are you afraid of?
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.680]   Like anyone out there listening,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.040]   if you find it hard to assess your flaws or your failures
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.840]   and reflect, the question I always say is like,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.200]   what are you afraid of?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.400]   And the answers usually fall into these different buckets,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.700]   and I'll just throw out a few.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.600]   Usually it's stigma, it's some kind of judgment
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.440]   from a super authority, a parental figure
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.240]   or a spouse or a friend group that if I acknowledge
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.240]   some type of shortcoming or even an aspiration,
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.600]   I wanna be a musician, my dad's gonna judge me.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.100]   There is something that's getting in the way
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.840]   of somebody being reflective of their dreams,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.760]   of their flaws, and it's usually something
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.660]   that was prosthetically installed externally, long sentence,
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.880]   but in other words, it's not that nature put it in there.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.600]   I think nature wires us to be reflective actually,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.200]   'cause it's a way to protect ourselves,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.540]   but nurture, your friend group, those parental figures,
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.080]   those people in your lives, over time they accumulate
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.600]   and they prevent you from wanting to look in.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.800]   So the number one exercise I go through with anyone
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.640]   when I'm establishing that rapport
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   and we're trying to establish a relationship or do a deal,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.200]   and I find that they under-index for self-awareness,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.240]   I try to identify, like, what are they afraid to find out?
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.800]   - So let's say someone goes through this process,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.540]   they're like, okay, one of the things for me I'll share
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.600]   is the first two jobs I had out of college I didn't like,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.680]   so I was convinced for probably a decade
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.920]   that I couldn't be happy and make money,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.900]   and so I was so afraid that I would either work a job
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.000]   I didn't like or have no money,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.760]   that this entire optimization and savings journey
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   really began from I need to find every way I can
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.760]   to save as much money as possible
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.200]   so I don't have to rely on a job to be unhappy,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.240]   and over a decade, as I managed to do that saving,
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.240]   I also managed to realize, oh, there are other jobs,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.920]   there are other things you can do with your life
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.980]   that will make you happy,
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.040]   but it took me a lot of work trying to figure out
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.640]   why do I think that I couldn't make money and be happy?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.880]   What is it?
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.920]   So it actually came to me,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.600]   but it's not sure I knew what to do with it for years.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   So what does someone do if they identify
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.440]   the thing that is holding them back
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.520]   or the thing they're afraid of, and then what?
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.480]   - I don't know.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.740]   That's for them to figure out, Chris.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.360]   I wanna get a tattoo eventually,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.920]   now I'm putting this out there in the world,
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.440]   but I can't find the words that are lasting enough
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.980]   to wanna imprint on my body.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.840]   If I had to settle right now,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.680]   it would be to face everything.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.380]   If you just simply acknowledge the fact
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.320]   that if you face everything,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.880]   including the thing you identified
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.040]   as the thing holding you back, that is where.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.000]   So let me use myself as a case study.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.080]   When I say that life brought me to my knees,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.880]   I had had cancer when I was 32 years old.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.640]   I had testicular cancer, and when I was diagnosed,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.240]   I talk about this in the book,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.400]   my first reaction was concealment,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.600]   that once people find out that I have cancer,
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.880]   and I was worried about losing my right testicle,
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.120]   that's like a tremendous trauma
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.200]   to go through in 24 hours, right?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.540]   But I was actually more concerned
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.780]   about everybody around me was gonna think I was weak,
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.800]   and now's the time they're finally gonna take Matt out.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.320]   I met my HR director on the corner of 57th Street
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.200]   because I didn't want anybody to see me in the office
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   so I could change my paperwork, my beneficiary, should I die?
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.200]   And then two days later, I was like,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.560]   how am I gonna prove to everybody that I'm undefeated?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.600]   And I was running the New York Jets business at the time,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.400]   and there was a dinner with the coaches,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.720]   and I decided to show up to that dinner,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.080]   and sit down, everyone's looking at me, it's cringy,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.040]   I have ice on my crotch, but I thought I was all tough,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.520]   and I raised a glass and did a toast.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.120]   I said, "Hey, I wanna tell everyone what my new motto is."
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.480]   And I said, "It's half the balls, twice the man."
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   And I said, "I just ordered dog tags,"
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.640]   which I still have to this day.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.360]   I tell this story because in my 20s,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   that was like, or early 30s, wow, that's so tough.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.260]   Look what you're telegraphing, right?
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.400]   It wasn't until later on when I got divorced,
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.560]   and my whole identity kinda crumbled, right?
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.100]   As this young kid who was able to do everything earlier,
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.600]   succeed earlier, you know, press, press, press.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.280]   This was one thing I couldn't press through,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   and it was a public shame that I needed to own.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.200]   That's how I saw it at the time.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.960]   But then I started reappraising everything,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.240]   saying, why did I go back to work two days later,
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.340]   after I had cancer, and like, was gonna die?
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.920]   And why have I been behaving like the house is on fire?
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.060]   And I realized, it's like I never warned the death
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.100]   of my mother, and I never left that tiny apartment
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.840]   in Queens, you know, living in that Roach Motel,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.520]   with no food, with eviction notices on the door,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.920]   and Con Edison about to turn off the power,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.000]   that I had never stopped living in that state
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.760]   of hypervigilance, despite the fact
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.320]   that I ran the New York Jets.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.480]   So what was I afraid to look at?
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.900]   I was afraid to look at the pain and suffering
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.300]   of that effort to try to save my mother.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.760]   Once I had nothing left, because my identity
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.580]   had been stripped, and I had sort of gone
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.660]   into a depression, right, to an extent,
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.920]   that was I able to realize my behavior, right,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.480]   to look at it for what it was.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.280]   And that changed the entire course of my career.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.960]   So it's hard to say what you're specifically
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   supposed to do, but I know what you're supposed
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.320]   to do is look within, and once you identify it,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.800]   is to face it and hug it, and like embrace it,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.240]   like almost with excitement.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.680]   When I realized your behavior makes no sense,
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.280]   because you think you're being chased,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.800]   when you're no longer being chased.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.120]   Once I realized the boogeyman wasn't behind me,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.760]   then everything started changing about my behavior.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.640]   - And are there things in your routine
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.900]   or your daily life that you now do differently,
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.100]   because you're in this new state?
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.300]   - Oh, I mean, so many things.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.780]   Like, let's just start as a leader,
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.500]   back to that story I just told you about,
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.700]   have the balls twice a man.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.460]   Imagine you worked for me at that time,
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.200]   and you were dealing with something in your life,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.240]   and you needed some space to heal, to mourn, to recover,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.540]   but you know the boss literally just had a surgery
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.700]   to remove a testicle on his back at the office.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.220]   That would tell you, telegraph to everyone around you,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.400]   that unless you are in a state as extreme as that,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   you better suck it up.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.640]   So to answer your question, I have done a 180,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.400]   and then I try to create an environment
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.860]   where people can surface the issues they're dealing with,
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.860]   because one, you make better decisions,
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.040]   and two, if people have space to be human,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.280]   you get more out of them in the end.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.800]   So that's one example.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.200]   And in my relationships, I tend to very quickly
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.880]   create space to be vulnerable and share details
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.320]   that maybe can be a little shocking,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.140]   but it's to open up the permission to do that.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.600]   But in every area of my life,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.800]   I am constantly trying to refine my ability
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.320]   to be self-aware and be unafraid about what I'm gonna find.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.360]   I'm constantly auditing my motives.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.560]   Like, why am I doing this?
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.720]   Even my own book, frankly, sometimes I say I wrote my book
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.920]   so I'd read my book, 'cause I'm like,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.160]   wait, now I am not on brand.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.400]   If I wrote it in a book, I gotta actually live to it
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.720]   or else it's kind of embarrassing.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.360]   So my book is now my accountability partner.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.140]   I read every day when I stray from it.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.560]   - Okay, so we've kind of talked about a little bit
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.360]   of what you need to do to evaluate yourself,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.920]   understand what might be holding you back.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.720]   If we look forward now, I know a lot of people
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.840]   who maybe they're not caught up in what's holding them back,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.320]   but they don't know where to go.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.920]   They know they are destined for something,
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.420]   but it's not that they're being held back,
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.160]   it's that they haven't figured out what's their motivation,
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.560]   what are they good at, what could they leverage in their life
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.840]   or their skills to start a company,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.560]   do something at their current job, anything.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.480]   I know you talk a lot about this in the book,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.920]   but what do you think people should do
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.960]   to try to figure out where their path should go?
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   - I have this dialogue with students oftentimes
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.840]   at Harvard Business School.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.640]   You would think top of the world, right?
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.320]   You've made it, you're at Harvard Business School,
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.560]   your life has been de-risked,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.540]   you'll always have a six figure job.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.080]   And yet I find even at that level,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.720]   people can sometimes be totally lost.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.840]   And it's because they're asking themselves
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.720]   the wrong question.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.680]   They're asking the question of what do I wanna do
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.320]   as opposed to who I wanna be?
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.200]   So I go through this discovery exercise
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.440]   with everybody I meet and I say,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.520]   when you imagine yourself the happiest,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.640]   are you a creator or are you an executor?
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.400]   When you imagine the environment that you thrive in,
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.720]   are you alone at a desk or are you in an office?
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.080]   The who do I wanna be
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   and how do I wanna spend my time questions
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.880]   are way more important than what do I wanna be?
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.680]   I wanna be a lawyer, I wanna be a...
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.480]   I actually think we should be spending way more time
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.020]   meditating about context, environment,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.120]   the cues that tell you a little bit more about yourself.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.520]   For example, in this exercise, it's in the book,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.960]   I was talking to a student
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.560]   trying to figure out what they wanna be.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.680]   And then in the series of questions, she had said,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.960]   "Actually, I wanna be the one
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.920]   "who enables a brilliant visionary,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.340]   "but I don't think I have it in me.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.800]   "So I wanna be the one who uses my hard skills
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   "to make somebody's dream come true."
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.640]   And I said, "Okay, we can work with that.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.240]   "Well, what kind of context do you enjoy being in?"
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.080]   And she said, her name was Rachel.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.920]   "Well, I love the beauty industry
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.880]   "and I'd love to end up there."
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.400]   I said, "Oh, well, as luck would have it,
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.480]   "I'm good friends with Bobby Brown."
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.360]   Bobby Brown, admittedly, hates math.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.260]   And she's about to launch this new company
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.520]   called Jones Road and finally go out on her own.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.440]   And she needs somebody, a quant, and to help her with that.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.960]   And I picked up the phone, put it on the table,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   and I said, "If Bobby Brown answers right now,
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.320]   "this is what's meant to be."
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.200]   She did.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.360]   And fast forward, Rachel ended up working for Bobby Brown
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.940]   and launching her new brand.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.120]   So I just say that as an illustration
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.040]   about what happens when you shift the questions
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.320]   to where do you wanna work, what company,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.060]   to who do you wanna be?
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.120]   And I go through that in the book too,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.840]   these kinds of questions that help you identify
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.360]   who you are as a person.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.200]   - I mentioned that some people
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.600]   might not know where they wanna go.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.840]   And you mentioned a couple things I could talk about.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.080]   You have an exercise in the book
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   that I think people should buy and take.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.720]   No matter where you are in your career,
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.360]   what about when someone has an idea of what they should do?
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.400]   And this is gonna bring it back to the title of the book.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.160]   You know, they're kind of wavering.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.000]   For me, I started this podcast and when I did,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.520]   I kinda put one toe in the water and said,
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.600]   "Let's see if there's eight episodes.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.780]   "Let's run it for a year
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.460]   "before I kind of really jump into it."
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.260]   I think this is one of the biggest themes titled the book.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.760]   So obviously, it's one of the biggest themes.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.440]   But how do people really get the buy-in
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.920]   and commitment in themselves?
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.200]   And what's kind of the research say about the way you plan
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.380]   and the impact it can have on the outcome?
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.520]   - Yeah, when I meet someone or a business owner or founder
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.760]   who the business is either failing or in some respects,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.440]   it's failing them emotionally
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.480]   because it no longer satisfies their soul.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.520]   Few years in, when I do the post-mortem about like,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.560]   "How did we get here?"
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.960]   What I often find,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.720]   it's because they refuse to ask the right questions
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.260]   at the beginning of the journey.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.300]   And there's a few reasons why.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.820]   When we have a great idea at three o'clock in the morning,
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.280]   most people are so excited
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.640]   that they've had something that stirred them,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.820]   especially if they're in a bad situation,
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.020]   that they are then afraid to subject that idea to scrutiny.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.000]   Because we also aren't taught to focus on opportunity costs,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.080]   especially if we don't value ourselves enough.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.960]   We don't wanna talk about opportunity costs.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.020]   We instead focus on how do I implement this idea?
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.400]   And I think that's how most people find themselves
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.240]   in a bad position.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.880]   So I do the opposite, right?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.600]   I totally focus when I have a big idea on opportunity cost.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.680]   I try to project Matt Higgins three years from now
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.400]   and ask whether this idea is big enough,
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.680]   interesting enough, valuable enough
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   to sustain me three years from now.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.640]   That requires you to believe two fundamental things.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.800]   One, if you're somebody who come up with a good idea,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.040]   you can come up with an even better idea a week from now.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.400]   It's a little bit like real estate.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.140]   Brokers will always tell you there's always a better house
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.560]   coming on the market next week.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.880]   The same is true with somebody who's an idea factory.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.680]   So don't be afraid to rule out your own idea.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.160]   And then two, I go through the exercise
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.680]   of opportunity cost.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.260]   I try to imagine what could be better than this?
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.720]   What could be three years from now
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.120]   when I'm out of this situation?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.960]   And the reason why that's so important
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.340]   is most people make relative decisions
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.720]   to the situation they're in to escape it.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.480]   Most big decisions we make,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.120]   and you see this in personal relationships
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.520]   when somebody leaves somebody for another person
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.580]   that rarely works out.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.840]   And same thing with a job.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.100]   If you take a job just to leave the last job,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.140]   that usually will leave you unsatisfied too.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.320]   So the reason why this opportunity cost decision matrix
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.360]   is so important,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.480]   'cause it will help you figure out,
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.520]   am I running from something or running to something?
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.440]   So I go through in the book,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.520]   this exercise around opportunity cost
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.040]   to pressure test our own ideas.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.260]   And if you do that,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.320]   and you spend a couple of days or a week
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   going through that exercise,
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.840]   you'll make a much better decision
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.400]   that's a sustainable decision.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.720]   - Like many of you out there,
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.960]   I love Notion.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.880]   And I am so happy to be partnering with them
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.840]   for this episode,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.400]   because I literally use Notion every single day
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.920]   for notes, trip planning,
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.240]   managing our family,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.080]   and even running all the hacks.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.000]   It is definitely one of my all-time favorite tools,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.160]   and I'm excited to tell you
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.680]   about their latest amazing feature, Notion AI,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   which can help you automate tedious tasks
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.760]   and streamline your workflow.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.760]   For example, you can save time and write faster
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.200]   by letting Notion AI handle the brainstorm and first draft,
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   or turn your messy notes into something
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.720]   a lot more polished.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.280]   I've been using it the past month,
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.880]   and it's blown my mind on multiple occasions.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.400]   In fact, when I was trying to explain
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.040]   what homeowner's insurance was in last week's episode,
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.120]   I just asked Notion AI to write a paragraph overview
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.040]   of what homeowner's insurance is for, and boom.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.160]   I can tell you firsthand that Notion AI
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.400]   helps you work faster, write better, and think bigger,
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.040]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.160]   And the best part?

[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.600]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.120]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.000]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.080]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.000]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.960]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.680]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.480]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.320]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.760]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.720]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.200]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.280]   that you got through another week.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.360]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.920]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.680]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.760]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.440]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.000]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.040]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.840]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.920]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.560]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.040]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.680]   So, whatever the occasion,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.960]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.200]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.600]   And you mentioned the idea
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.080]   of just leaving a job for another job.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.320]   So, to go back to the,
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.160]   this isn't just about running a business.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.320]   This isn't just about being a founder.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   Ideas that came to my mind were deciding
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.400]   to quit your job to do something totally different.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.120]   That isn't starting a company.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.560]   Are there ways that you think people
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.000]   can process those big decisions
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.680]   and think about the things holding them back?
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.280]   So, let's say we've identified,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.640]   okay, I'm not just trying to escape this job I don't like.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.840]   I've really found a thing I think I'm passionate about.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.640]   I went through this myself over the course of 18 months
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.040]   with this podcast,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.160]   but I think there are a lot of people out there
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.520]   who they have the idea.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.560]   They're not being pushed away
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.320]   as much as they are being pulled,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.480]   but they're just scared or there's fear about going all in.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.960]   Let's talk about going all in.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.320]   Let's talk about burning the boat.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.880]   Let's talk about why maybe going slow
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.040]   or having a plan B isn't actually helping you.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.080]   Yeah, so we have our idea.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.040]   We've done our exercise.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.960]   We've pressure tested opportunity costs.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.080]   It's an idea worth pursuing.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.360]   We're ready to go.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.800]   And then we get stuck.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.440]   So, what are the reasons people often get stuck?
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.040]   Obviously, one is fear.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.840]   When people sometimes hear about the title of my book,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.680]   "Burn the Boats,"
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.480]   they presume I mean "Reckless Abandon,"
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.320]   but the book would be called
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.360]   "Burn the Boats" with you in it, and it's not.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.080]   So, I am one of the most paranoid risk takers
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.240]   you're ever gonna meet,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.200]   but how you synthesize risk and fear is everything
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.960]   when it comes to plan A.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.200]   So, what do I mean by that?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.680]   That those who are able to fully commit
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.440]   to their own dreams and ambition
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.040]   have done the work to process the worst case scenario
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.880]   at the outset.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.920]   So, I'm always going through the following exercise
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.160]   when I have a big idea that I wanna go all in on,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.000]   and that is one,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.920]   what's the worst possible thing that could happen
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.480]   if this does not work out?
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.800]   First question I ask,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.480]   what would I do if the worst thing
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.280]   that could possibly happen happened?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.640]   How would I mitigate it?
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.520]   I have never asked myself that question
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.680]   and never had an answer to mitigate
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.760]   that is entirely within my control.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.720]   So, what I find is mostly the reasons are not practical.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.240]   They have to do with judgment and fear of being judged
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.360]   or fear of being embarrassed.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.080]   But to the extent to which it's,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.960]   I started a new job and it ended up being out of my depth.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.920]   That was my plan A.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.760]   You know, you could always be like,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.120]   I'll just go back and get that other job
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.480]   because we're primal creatures.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.240]   We are already equipped with the ability to defend ourselves
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.480]   when our plan A doesn't work out.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.760]   But unless we pressure test that at the beginning,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.320]   then the third question I ask,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.760]   what's the probability
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.520]   that the worst case scenario will materialize?
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.440]   Usually the probability is actually very low
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.880]   because we could catastrophize if you pressure test it.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   And then the fourth question I ask is,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.640]   what would I be willing to do to have that plan A?
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.440]   What would I be willing to endure
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.960]   to end up having that work out?
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.400]   So, in the case of Harvard,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.000]   when I taught at Harvard Business School,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.320]   which was very uncomfortable to me,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.240]   I'd never been in a classroom before,
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.160]   but I wanted this so desperately,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   the idea that I had performed well at Harvard
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.600]   and had left these kids with something
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.960]   that was five times more valuable than their tuition,
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.680]   which was the objective I set.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.240]   I was like, I would walk on glass to succeed.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.440]   I would subject myself to endless ridicule,
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.560]   public scorn.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.840]   I would come within an inch of my life to achieve.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.480]   That's how much it mattered to me.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.800]   And when I pressure test through those four questions,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.400]   through that synthesizing risk,
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.720]   I was like, it's a no brainer to go on.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.640]   So why does it matter?
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.920]   Why does that decision matter?
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.840]   Because when we are pursuing really hard things
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.400]   that take a long time,
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.760]   you're gonna take incoming, external and internal,
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.240]   the voice in your head, people around you,
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.880]   that are gonna make you wanna turn back.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.440]   So, if you haven't already processed risk,
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.520]   you don't remember.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.280]   And because you've done it at the beginning of the journey,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.320]   you're like, wait a minute, I already asked myself
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.640]   how I would handle if this didn't work out,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.720]   and I'm okay with it.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.120]   It's the memory that you went through
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.480]   that risk synthesis operation, exercise rather,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.080]   that sustains you.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.000]   Let's talk about a little bit what plan B means.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.600]   Sometimes people think plan B means risk mitigation,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.480]   but I already said plan A incorporates risk mitigation.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.440]   You've already gone through it.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.240]   What plan B and what the science shows is,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.800]   plan B is not about de-risking anything.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.080]   Plan B is a way for you to achieve your subordinate goal.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.640]   So, let's use it to anyone out there listening
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   who wants to be a musician,
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.240]   but they have a crappy job that they hate.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.120]   But you're like, you know what?
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.720]   My dad always said I shouldn't be a musician,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.360]   but I don't care, I'm gonna tell him to F him,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.760]   and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna be a musician.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.240]   I'm gonna work really hard until I get on that band.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.600]   However, if it doesn't work out,
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.440]   I do have a plan B.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.920]   I'm gonna go work at Bob's Record Store,
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.280]   'cause I'm always perusing the aisles,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.800]   and he thinks I'm really smart.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.040]   That's your subordinate goal,
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.400]   which is to get a job different than the one you have,
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   right, in the music sector,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.840]   but very different being a musician
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.760]   than working at Bob's Record Store.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.080]   And what the study and the science shows
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.520]   is that plan B is actually an alternative way
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.280]   for you to relieve the pain and discomfort
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.720]   of pursuing your goals.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.160]   So, there are two ways to get that done.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   I can either win, succeed on plan A,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.040]   or I can go for my lesser subordinate goal,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.840]   which is gonna leave me unhappy.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.720]   And then the last piece of interesting research
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.760]   that came out of Wharton in 2014
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.720]   was they found that just the mere contemplation
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.560]   of having a plan B, Bob's Record Store,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.720]   is enough to ensure you will never be a musician.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.760]   Just thinking about it.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.640]   And what they also found in the research,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.360]   just having that insidious thought
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.000]   of working in that record store
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.800]   is going to dramatically reduce your desire
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.240]   to ever be a musician.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.080]   So, it's two things.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.840]   You won't succeed, and you won't care as much anymore.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.680]   That was a lot to unpack, Chris.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.520]   (laughing)
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.280]   Yeah, I'm just thinking, like, it's hard for some people,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.280]   especially maybe someone like myself,
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.200]   where I'm like always thinking about all the outcomes,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.040]   all the options, to not have a plan B.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.320]   But is having a plan B different
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.280]   than knowing that a plan B exists?
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.120]   There is.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.960]   I love that you said that.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.360]   That's such a smart way to put it.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.440]   Having a plan B is very different
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.400]   than the peace of knowing a plan B is out there for you.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.680]   And you don't need to return to it
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.760]   because you've already, at the beginning of the journey
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.600]   in pursuit of plan A, identified what it is.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.400]   Like, it does not need to be crystallized
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.800]   because you'll know you'll get a job somewhere,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.280]   not Bob's particularly.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.520]   But if I'm having dinner with a friend
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.920]   and I'm like, I'm going all in, I'm becoming a musician,
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.760]   and they're like, yeah, and if it doesn't work out,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.280]   you could just go work at Bob's Records.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.000]   And it's like, oh, well, now that I know that's an option,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.840]   I assume it wouldn't be fair to say,
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.320]   I can never become a musician again
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.080]   because I've now heard that there is a thing.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.640]   Or is it more when you start to say, okay,
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.560]   yeah, that guy, he's right.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.480]   I could just do this.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.920]   That's gonna be fine.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.280]   I'm trying to think how do you, as a optimizer,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.480]   thinking through all the options,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.600]   still make sure you aren't putting your primary goal at risk
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.080]   by just thinking about them?
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.480]   - Well, it's a great question.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.640]   And so studies showed when you did introduce
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.200]   the idea of thinking about,
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.240]   I think the difference is all about sequencing.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.560]   If you had that dinner with your buddy
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.400]   who was a little skeptical, like, hey, Chris,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.720]   you're kind of delusional.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.680]   You sort of suck too.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.480]   Your guitar playing isn't any good.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.600]   Unlikely, right?
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.120]   If you had yet to do what I said
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.480]   at the beginning of this conversation
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.920]   and have that risk synthesis process, right?
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.120]   That would have been the first time
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.440]   that somebody was now intruding into your thoughts.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.680]   And then you get defensive, like,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.600]   well, I could always go work at Bob's, right?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.800]   But if you had already done the beginning,
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.480]   like, you're not even hearing it.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.480]   Like, it does not matter.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.560]   You're fearless and you're impervious
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.880]   because you already are self-contained.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.040]   I already know what I'm gonna do.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.480]   And I don't care what you say.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.160]   It's not registering.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.600]   But if you hadn't already done that work on plan A,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.040]   if it wasn't part of your plan A,
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.280]   you would be susceptible to it.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   So this can sound like semantics,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.640]   but I'm 100% convinced it's not semantics
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.040]   because the research shows it.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.960]   But you asked a great question is how to delineate
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.600]   between having already once thought through it
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.520]   versus having it at the table
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.240]   while you're going after plan A.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.080]   I'll give it to you in a practical setting.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.960]   There's some stuff I put in this book
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.760]   that I can't read, that I cringe at.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.400]   It's so deeply personal.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.920]   A couple of weeks before it got published,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.880]   I was going for a walk
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.480]   and I was having a low serotonin moment.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.720]   And I repeated on me, like,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.320]   why did I put that in the book?
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.760]   Why did I put that in the book?
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.200]   Should I go change it?
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.560]   And then I was like, wait a second.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.760]   We already went through this, Matt,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.080]   at the beginning of the journey.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.080]   You put it in the book because you're pretty sure
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.000]   somebody out there who's reading it right now
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.560]   is depressed and hopeless.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.000]   And they're gonna read between the lines
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.680]   of what you wrote in that sentence.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.000]   And it may change the trajectory of their life.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.640]   You've already made the decision.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.480]   That's the difference.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   And then I've already gone through, all right.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.240]   So it gets published and amplified in ways
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.280]   that I didn't really intend.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.200]   Like I'll live with it.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.920]   But the benefit of helping somebody out there
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.240]   read that sentence is worth it.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.000]   So again, nuance, but not semantics.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.480]   - And when I think about this idea of,
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.440]   okay, go all in on this thing.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.120]   You can be impervious to the feedback
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.760]   that maybe it won't work 'cause you've committed.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.840]   You've metaphorically burnt your boat.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.240]   Does that necessarily mean you have to commit
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.520]   to the full goal all at once?
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.400]   Or I'll give a concrete example that we talked about
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.680]   for two minutes before we got started was,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.240]   I have this vision and this is the first time
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.280]   I think I'm sharing it on the podcast.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.640]   So it's kind of fun.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.880]   There's AARP, this thing that everyone knows,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.000]   oh, my parents are retired.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.240]   They joined this organization
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.760]   and they have all these great things
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.120]   and they've created a community of reasons
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.480]   that you would join a membership program for something.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.160]   I don't see something like that
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.200]   for the millennial who likes experiences.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.480]   They're not gonna join AARP,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.560]   though I have in the past said you can for deals,
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.080]   even as a not old person, retired, you could join.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.400]   But I thought, oh, what if I start something
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.040]   that could be a valuable membership
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.400]   that I hope people get value out of
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.600]   related to all the hacks?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.480]   So it's an idea I have.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.040]   I haven't gone all in on it yet, right?
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.120]   I haven't even said I'm gonna do it until right now.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.320]   But do I need to commit to,
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.600]   this is going to be a massive thing
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.280]   to effectively burn the boat,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.840]   or could I say, hey, I'm thinking of starting this.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.160]   Now I've at least created some public accountability.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.200]   Or maybe I create it and I say,
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.760]   here's where you can sign up.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.440]   I haven't built it all out to everything
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.360]   everyone might want.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.920]   Maybe only a handful of you listening
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.480]   wanna join with a few aspects of it.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.000]   How much do you have to commit to your grand vision
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.280]   to have burnt your boat, so to speak?
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.000]   - Well, I would argue that everything you just said
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.360]   is not your plan A yet
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.600]   because you're still in the formation phase.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.000]   So I think we get to define when it becomes a plan A.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.560]   It's about crossing the threshold of saying,
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.080]   I am going to do everything I can to manifest this.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.720]   And you and the language you've used are not there yet.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   It's all about our personal comfort level
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.000]   with risk and commitment
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.640]   and where it ranks with your other priorities.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.320]   So we are allowed to play and toy.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.520]   In the book, I talk about this.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.960]   I go pretty far down the road
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.640]   before I decide whether this is the thing.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.240]   And I don't mind having goals that are in parallel
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.680]   and sometimes in conflict, right?
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.840]   I became a lawyer who goes to law school,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.800]   gets an offer from Scadden Arps,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   and then I'm like, "No, I don't want to be a lawyer."
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.280]   And then I never even took the bar exam.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.440]   Plan A and burning the boats
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.880]   is not about dogmatic, rigid,
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.440]   forcing yourself to fully commit to everything
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.200]   that comes into your head.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.040]   But when you've decided, Chris,
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.520]   that you're doing this membership program,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.960]   which by the way is a great idea,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.360]   and I'll sign up right now
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.800]   without even knowing a single benefit
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.440]   because the way you hack everything feels valuable to me.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.080]   This conversation is already fun.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.120]   So I'm all in already.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.840]   Hopefully that escalates your commitment.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.760]   But it is not your plan A yet.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.320]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.520]   - I've already decided.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.360]   I've burnt the boat.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.240]   I'm all in on all the hacks, right?
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.520]   Like it's my full-time thing.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.480]   I left my company, job, everything.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.960]   This is it.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.200]   Do you actually need to burn the boats
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.320]   on all the small projects in your life
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.720]   and commit to a plan A?
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.920]   Or is it really more a higher order thing
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.800]   for one or two projects in your life,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.400]   your professional career, your relationships?
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.960]   How do I think about it on that spectrum?
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.400]   - I actually don't render an opinion
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.200]   on the number of plan A's we can have
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.920]   because I think the joy of living,
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.160]   at least as I've identified it,
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.400]   is in the perpetual pursuit of these growth opportunities
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.360]   that stretch me, that make me uncomfortable,
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.000]   and they tend to be operating simultaneously.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.840]   What I do though is I try to consolidate my gains
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.120]   because if I'm jumping from thing to thing
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.400]   and then I look behind me
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.720]   and I see a sea of unfinished projects
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.960]   and a lot of hurt people who were like,
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.800]   "Matt, where'd you go?
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.840]   "You were so into this.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.880]   "What year ago?"
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.360]   That begins to chip away at my self-esteem, right?
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.160]   I'm not proud of my behavior.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.200]   So I try to hold myself accountable
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.240]   to scaling and optimizing.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.320]   Things get easier the third, fourth time you do it.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.080]   But I don't think it matters how many plan A's you have.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.280]   It's really about once it becomes a plan A,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.200]   how do you increase the likelihood you will be successful?
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.520]   That's all my book is about.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.440]   How do I put the odds in your favor
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.320]   once you've identified this thing as a plan A?
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.480]   Not your only plan A, but a plan A.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.160]   You can have 17 plan A's, just zero plan B's.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.360]   I'm having this conversation in my head
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   of whether the mere existence of multiple plan A's
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.560]   is plan B's.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.440]   I gave you the framework before,
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.920]   which is a fun question.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.120]   A plan B is by definition a way to achieve
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.280]   the subordinate goal of plan A.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.520]   So that's how it becomes a plan B.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.560]   That's why the musician and Bob's Record Store
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.120]   is a perfect way 'cause both give him a new job,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.040]   but they're very different.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.400]   So as long as you're 17 or your membership club,
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.880]   your podcast, they're like very hard things
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.560]   that require total, utter commitment.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.480]   For me, I think I try to have a few number of things
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.360]   because I just personally can't manage
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.160]   lots of projects at once.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.080]   Which goes back to something you said in the book,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.040]   you talk about how to figure out what you're good at
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.680]   and accept that you're not good at everything.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.160]   It took me a lot of time to process this
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.800]   and I'll shout out my time at Wealthfront.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.840]   As a product manager, I realized
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.400]   there are parts of being a product manager
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.760]   that I'm just not good at.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   And I realized that not as early, but early enough.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.440]   And I think it's hard for people.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.560]   So I'm curious if you have any tactics
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.640]   for people to realize it and accept it,
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.160]   because I think it's so easy to assume
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.200]   that if you're good at something,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.840]   you can be good at everything.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.520]   And it's very hard to be self-critical,
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.440]   but I guess both, how can you find it?
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.800]   And maybe what are some things you could say
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.160]   to encourage people that learning the things
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.040]   you're not good at is actually a valuable thing to learn?
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.480]   There's a concept in land use and zoning
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.640]   that relates to property.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.680]   And it's to ensure that property is always put
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.800]   to its best use based on the current context.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   So it's called highest and best use.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.240]   And to make that less abstract,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.320]   a warehouse in Tribeca in 1920,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.000]   the highest and best use of that warehouse
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.120]   was as a slaughterhouse.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.360]   In 2020, Taylor Swift is hanging out there
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.080]   with her private elevator, right?
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.000]   Like the property changes.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.240]   I look at myself like a piece of property
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.040]   that is always changing due to its context,
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.400]   except the context is not external, it's internal.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.000]   I am an amalgam of all the things
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.240]   I've accomplished prior to today.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.000]   Oh, well, now I'm a guy who was on "Shark Tank."
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.320]   I know how to do TV.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.360]   Now I'm a person who teaches at Harvard Business School.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.440]   I know how to teach.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.280]   Now I wrote a book.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.300]   Now I'm an author.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.400]   I have things to say.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.200]   I ask myself every single week, sometimes every day,
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.840]   what is the highest and best use of Matt Higgins
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.920]   now that he has accomplished
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.640]   whatever it is he did yesterday?
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.200]   Whatever it is I've now achieved through my trauma?
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.800]   Part of the highest and best use of me now
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.640]   is to share painful things
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.320]   that some people don't talk about
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.200]   because that's very valuable.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.040]   By focusing on the affirmative and asking yourself,
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.520]   anybody listening right now,
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.500]   what's the highest and best use of you,
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.360]   rather than be a negative of saying,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.460]   you begin to cull the herd of opportunity
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.160]   and say like, well, I mean, I could do Excel,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.000]   but I'm not that good at it.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.440]   And by the way, why do I wanna be?
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.400]   And say, right, I'm a good communicator
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   and I can synthesize complicated information
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.620]   and I could operate a company,
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.600]   but it's not the highest and best use of Matt Higgins
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.400]   is to operate a company with 200 people,
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.360]   even though I've done it before.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.720]   So I don't know why people are afraid of this.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.920]   Like, why do you wanna be good at everything?
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.480]   Don't you wanna be great at a few things?
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.520]   But besides, if you ask the question I just gave you,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.600]   the answer will lead you
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.120]   to where you should be spending your energy
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.840]   and you don't have to make a value judgment.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.000]   There's no value in the statement I just gave
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.040]   about the highest and best use.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.280]   It just is true.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.100]   That's my number one piece of advice.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.680]   - Sounds like stop reframing what am I not good at
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.320]   and just focus on what you're great at.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.120]   - Yeah, and now as I say this,
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.960]   and you bring up a great point,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.040]   I find it's one of the hardest things
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.480]   for founders to accept is those limitations
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.680]   because they don't know what it means to be a CEO, right?
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.520]   When you're a founder,
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.840]   you suddenly go from an idea creator to an implementer
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.120]   to a capital convener,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.560]   and then all of a sudden you run an operating business.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.660]   So you believe that being a good CEO, good founder,
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.840]   is having the capacity to run an operating business
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.080]   and do everything.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.320]   And they don't realize that actually being a good founder,
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.760]   good CEO, is the ability to identify talent
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.920]   that's better than you at each position
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.440]   and to render yourself obsolete wherever you possibly can.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.120]   But I find a lot of people struggle with this
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.260]   from an identity standpoint.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.400]   They feel like they need to be good at it
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.200]   only 'cause no one gave them an alternative definition.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.400]   - Or even in the non-founder CEO world,
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.760]   I find that people often think
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.800]   that there's a prescribed path.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.280]   You do a job, you do it well,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.000]   and then you manage people doing it.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.720]   And I have met countless people that have realized
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.240]   that the best use of their time
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.800]   is not managing other people.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.200]   And other people, similarly, are phenomenal at it,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.840]   even if they aren't a master of the skill of their industry
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.240]   or whatever the people that they manage do.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.080]   So if you're a designer,
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.440]   you might not be the best designer in the world,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.760]   but you could actually be the best design manager.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.280]   - I find a lot of people feel, for whatever reason,
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.080]   they wanna be branded like an operator.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.240]   They're insecure about not being an operator,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.600]   which fundamentally being an operator
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   or managing people is being a very good therapist.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.640]   And a lot of people don't have the patience or the EQ
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.480]   to be a therapist.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.320]   And so therefore,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.920]   you're probably not gonna be a very good operator
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.680]   'cause it requires so much time and patience
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.920]   to get the most out of people.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.760]   But I find that scenario a lot.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.680]   People just get insecure
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.320]   about not being like an operator, an executor.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.160]   - Interesting.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.040]   I find that so many people think
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.000]   that management is the next step.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.720]   I'm excited when I hear stories of people
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.880]   that realize that wasn't the case and what they did.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.500]   And Google was one of the few companies
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.680]   that created alternative track
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.900]   for someone to just be very senior, very highly compensated,
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.480]   but not be a manager.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.280]   And I see that trend picking up
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.560]   at least at a lot of companies in Silicon Valley.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.720]   And I hope that continues to permeate itself
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.040]   through all industries.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.120]   - It's possible to separate influence and authority
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.400]   from command control responsibility.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.240]   And it makes sense
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.840]   'cause most people are very bad managers.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.660]   So it makes sense
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.560]   that not everybody was born to be a manager.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.000]   - And so while we're on the topic of things
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.960]   that we might not be good at, let's put that aside.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.400]   But let's talk about when things don't go right.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.880]   When you do fail,
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.480]   are there things that people should be doing?
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.160]   'Cause look, once you've committed to a plan A,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.920]   you've boarded the boats, you're on the way,
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.700]   it's inevitable that things will go wrong along the way.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.120]   Talk about the fear to get started, the fear to commit,
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.400]   but what about the challenges that come along the way,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.640]   processing those failures?
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.160]   You wanna be a musician, you decide to go all in,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.240]   you do your first gig, no one shows up, it's a disaster.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.840]   How would you advise someone to process that failure
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   and continue pushing forward?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.080]   Or maybe understand when they shouldn't.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.700]   - Yeah, that's a big reason why I wrote this book,
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.160]   because I have seen throughout my life
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.280]   the same fact pattern play over and over again,
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.720]   which I don't quite understand
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.000]   why the universe is wired this way,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.520]   but the act of persistence
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.800]   is a tremendous predictor of future success.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.920]   The mere act of persisting and surviving another day
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.800]   will ultimately beget success,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.480]   which doesn't make any sense, right?
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.320]   Like, what do you mean I just stay around another day,
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.740]   I just push through and then eventually I get what I want?
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.280]   But the answer is it's true.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.240]   And so I talk in the book about
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.980]   the most successful people I've seen
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.260]   would break through success.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.460]   If I try to discern, like,
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.860]   what's the common fact pattern here?
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.660]   Come from all sorts of different fields,
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.540]   different walks of life.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.480]   The common fact pattern I see is when they face a setback,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.180]   they simply expand the definition of what success looks like
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.780]   to accommodate that particular setback.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.740]   It sounds almost delusional, it's like,
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.340]   I'm so glad that didn't work out
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.940]   because I never would have hired Bill,
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.880]   and now that Bill's here, I'm gonna make a billion dollars.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.200]   And yet when they have a win, it enhances their self-esteem.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.540]   So what's the point of saying that?
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.460]   It's very important how we process failure.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.660]   One, accept the fact that the goal is to continue,
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.580]   is to survive.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.620]   So how do I survive?
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.660]   How do I keep going?
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.140]   And the number one thing you need to do to survive
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.860]   is to preserve your sense of self-worth.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.360]   It's something we don't like focus on,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.940]   but your number one objective when you have a setback
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.700]   is to ensure that particular failure
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.700]   does not become enmeshed with your permanent identity.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.540]   So number one, my process is,
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.740]   I acknowledge that I failed,
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.340]   so I remain intellectually honest.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.680]   Also by acknowledging it verbally and otherwise,
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.520]   it loses its power over you.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.960]   The fear of even acknowledging it
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.280]   is the thing that kind of is half the battle,
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.540]   and being able to be like, yeah, I failed, whatever.
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.280]   But then number two, I am not a failure.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.840]   Like, I just refuse to be identified,
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.680]   and that's the point I made
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.440]   about these outrageously successful people.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.400]   It's like, it just does not penetrate
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.160]   their reality distortion field.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.520]   So number two, I'm not a failure.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.160]   Three, but what is a failure trying to teach me?
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.560]   How do I extract maximum value from this failure?
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.680]   Back to my point about survival and persistence,
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.100]   in the failure is the answers
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.460]   to your future persistence, your survival,
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.980]   and you have to mine it and sit with it for a bit.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.420]   And then the fourth piece is to never look at it again,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.820]   once you've extracted value.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.540]   And I'm not great at that.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.100]   And again, I wrote my book, so I'd read my book.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.140]   So anybody here saying, wow, that's great,
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.820]   but I can't do it, understand that I struggle with this too,
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.140]   but I know it's true.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.660]   So while I struggle with it,
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.260]   I remind myself that is the way to do it.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.520]   But those four simple, easy steps, and then go forward.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.380]   Back to our point about the musician,
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.980]   like, when should he give up?
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.780]   The answer is like, never.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.500]   It's just like, find a different way.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.180]   Find a different way to be in the band.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.460]   Maybe you're not the lead guitarist,
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.700]   but you're in the damn band.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.500]   And just like, never stop.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.420]   That doesn't mean never iterate, never course correct.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.340]   That's like, you have to do those things,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.140]   but just never stop.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.380]   And that's why it's so important
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.820]   to have this plan A construct and to accept the idea
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.420]   of the way you're gonna get what you want
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.060]   is to not have the plan B
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.300]   and to have processed the risk
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.720]   at the beginning of the journey,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.860]   because the way to be ultimately successful in life
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.900]   is to never give up.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.140]   I know it sounds so corny and it's in all the books,
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.740]   but there's a reason there are cliches, right?
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.040]   'Cause they tend to be true.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.260]   You just don't stop.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.340]   - I have a specific anecdote from researching podcasting,
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.100]   which is someone always asks,
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.660]   like, how do you be a top podcast?
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.500]   And I was like, well,
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.700]   I have one piece of advice that's very easy.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.900]   There are 4 million podcasts.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.660]   And if you filter the 4 million down by podcasts
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.500]   that have done more than 10 episodes ever
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.520]   and have published in the last 10 days,
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.700]   you delete 96% of podcasts.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.380]   So it's like, if you wanna be in the top 5%
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.020]   of all podcasts that have been created,
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.980]   not the top 5% that are active,
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.460]   but of all, you literally just have to produce 10 episodes
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.460]   and keep going.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.300]   And that's it.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.700]   So you're not wrong.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.460]   - We don't wanna accept that for some reason.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.340]   I don't know why.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.700]   I mean, because it's really hard.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.660]   And there are moments like
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.140]   I'm going through something right now.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.900]   There's always moments when I think
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.980]   that can't possibly be true.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.820]   It can't be that if I just stay the course
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.940]   and continue to make course corrections and refinements
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.940]   that ultimately I'm gonna get what I want.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.140]   No matter what, despite everything I'm saying right now,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.580]   it gets bleak for me.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.020]   And I cannot believe that statement is true.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.960]   And yet I just forced myself to believe it.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.580]   And in the end, it is always true.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.520]   It's just, I don't know how it's gonna play out.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.220]   Even my book, when you open my book,
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.380]   anybody out there who reads it,
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.540]   they'll tell you just a funny story.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.180]   I did a $200 million back during a pandemic.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.140]   I knew that the industry would probably turn,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.140]   but I thought I could do a great deal
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.380]   and I could get it done and I would learn public markets
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.960]   and maybe I could outrun the timing
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.740]   and I could just show how it could be done better.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   Long story short.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.500]   So that was the opening of my book.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.020]   And in doing my SPAC,
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.840]   I had to will every part of this to existence,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.020]   including the IPO.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.660]   I IPO'd at the height of COVID and it almost fell apart
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.700]   and I had to just stay up all night and to get it done.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.540]   I didn't feel good, but I just kept working through it.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.820]   I rang the bell the next day.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.880]   Within two days, I had double pneumonia
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.940]   and my oscillator, the oxygen was dropping.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.300]   I'm like, wow, now I may die because I did this,
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.420]   but I got it done.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.260]   And then I got a deal done and on and on and on.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.940]   And then ultimately the market turned
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.860]   and the SPAC fell apart.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.060]   That was the beginning of my book.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.600]   Okay, I'm gonna have to acknowledge a little failure
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.340]   in the beginning, but the good thing is I have my TV show.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.860]   I have a Shark Tank spinoff.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.820]   I'm gonna open the book about my Shark Tank spinoff
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.680]   and tell everybody how I'm partnering with Mark Burnett.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.820]   I'm leveling up.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.380]   It's the whole premise of my book.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.640]   I'm gonna get that done.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.380]   So I write that.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.980]   And then the TV show gets canceled before it ever airs.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.060]   My editor is like, I think we gotta rewrite
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:47.900]   the beginning of the book.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.220]   And I'm like, no, I think that's the point of the book.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.140]   Like, this is how it goes.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.260]   And you know what?
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.180]   When we look back, if I did a podcast with you
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.180]   three years from now, I guarantee you
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.380]   there's gonna be exponential value somehow
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   that came from me knowing how to bring a company public.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.940]   And two, my TV experience is gonna result
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.180]   in the next iteration of Shark Tank that I created.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.620]   It's just the way the universe works.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.860]   But when you're in the middle of it and it's bleak,
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.740]   sometimes it all doesn't make sense,
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.100]   which is why you need the faith.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.320]   But if you just burn the boats,
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.020]   it's gonna play out in your favor.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.900]   With travel back on the calendar and my kid in preschool,
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.880]   I need an easy way to optimize my immune system
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.340]   and get some extra energy every day,
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.060]   which is why I kickstart my day with AG1
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.020]   from Athletic Greens, and I'm excited
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.860]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.400]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.140]   because I think it's the best option
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.020]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.500]   You take one scoop of AG1 and you're absorbing
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.180]   75 high-quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.460]   whole food source superfoods, probiotics,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.740]   and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.180]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.340]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.420]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.940]   and energized for the day,
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.460]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.220]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.260]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.020]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.100]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.980]   of immune-supporting vitamin D

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.520]   at your financial planning.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.360]   If you've been meaning to get life insurance
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.780]   but have been putting it off, now is the time.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.460]   With Fabric by Gerber Life,

[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.460]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.820]   and I found Fabric to be highly competitive
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.940]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.180]   You're seeing all these things fall apart.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.100]   Sorry about that.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:13.940]   - Thanks, yeah.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.580]   Well, I'm just trying to practice what I preach
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.580]   and model what it looks like.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.420]   - But how does being a paranoid risk taker
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.060]   play into all of this?
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.260]   - I spent a lot of time agonizing of whether I should
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.220]   or should not do this back.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.540]   All the things that could play out.
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.580]   Exactly what played out was on the list.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.140]   So, I was able to go all in on plan A.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.060]   Plan A is not a delusional belief
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.900]   that you're gonna get what you're entitled to.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.780]   It's the utter commitment to the goal.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.420]   The only way, that SPAC had any shot
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.500]   of becoming an IPO or getting a deal done
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.900]   is if I had fully committed to it.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   If I had an ounce of plan B as I was going it,
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.580]   I wouldn't have gotten as far as I would have gotten.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.460]   And the same thing with the TV show,
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.860]   it wouldn't even gotten remotely close.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.460]   So, as a paranoid risk taker,
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.740]   it's especially important for me to have processed
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.420]   all the risk at the beginning of the journey
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.300]   because then I would have these intrusive thoughts
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.740]   that never would have enabled me to get it done.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.540]   They're not at all mutually exclusive.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.940]   It's actually more important for a risk-adverse person
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.180]   to do what I'm saying and to go through that exercise
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.340]   and process everything.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.700]   'Cause when I was taking on water
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.780]   through both of those experiences,
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.060]   I kept remembering, you've gone through this,
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.180]   you knew this could happen.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.220]   Attack, keep going forward and don't be afraid.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.740]   You already know you have the tools necessary
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.420]   to handle whatever happens.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.620]   Earlier in the conversation, you talked about goal setting.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.020]   You've just walked through some big projects you worked on.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.100]   Is there a framework you use to set goals
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.860]   in your personal or professional life?
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.020]   Yes, I think if you're gonna commit to a life
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.940]   of perpetual pursuit of bigger and bigger opportunities
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.100]   and you're gonna put yourself in uncomfortable positions,
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.180]   you could find yourself drowning or overwhelmed
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.060]   or have taken on way too much.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.940]   So, I always say, this also helps me with processing risk
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.780]   and going all in on plan A.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.820]   I believe it's important to identify
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.980]   what can I not live without, right?
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:58.660]   If I lost everything, what do I absolutely need to maintain
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.660]   in order to have a degree of peace and happiness?
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.140]   And as you become more successful,
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.020]   your relationship with risk actually increases
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.100]   'cause you have more to lose.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.580]   You get more afraid to take bigger swings.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.100]   I find this with colleagues all the time,
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.700]   like, well, now I have the big job and the big salary,
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.460]   now I'm even more afraid to take on risk.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.980]   And so, I think it's actually very important
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.780]   to define your needs as narrowly as possible
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.780]   the more successful you become
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.980]   and then try to let that base case not change.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:30.420]   So, I draw a hard line of boundaries around my kids,
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.180]   my spouse who's my best friend,
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.580]   a few basic things that I need.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.420]   We're always saying like,
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.660]   what's the smallest apartment we could live in?
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.740]   So, I'm not afraid of everything going to crap.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.700]   And so, that's how I set objectives.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.620]   And when I feel like I've taken on a lot,
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.620]   that something may fail, then I'm always like,
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.660]   well, it doesn't matter because I know what I need
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:47.780]   if everything were to go to hell.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.300]   And I think people don't do that.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.620]   People don't ask like, what's the minimum?
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.380]   They focus more on what they want,
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.900]   not what could they live with
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.140]   if they don't get what they want
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.220]   or what they have is taken away from them.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.180]   - You talked about things going wrong.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.700]   You've had experiences in your life
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.860]   that have dealt with all kinds of crises
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.460]   from the biggest stage
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.220]   to lots of business operational things.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.300]   Maybe talk a little bit about your experience
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.580]   dealing with big crises and how you manage that
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.860]   both internally and externally.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.100]   - Yeah, for those that don't know,
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.260]   I was the Press Secretary to the Mayor of New York
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.980]   on September 11th, 2001.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.900]   And then I went and helped oversee
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.580]   the rebuilding of the World Trade Center
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.820]   as Chief Operating Officer.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.300]   So I spent two years at ground zero
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.900]   from the moment that first plane struck the tower.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.980]   And so the most extraordinary, complicated
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.780]   and gut-wrenching crisis maybe in American history.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.820]   And my first takeaway that I learned from that experience
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.500]   was how showing up is half of everything
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.780]   and how people get that wrong.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.540]   They get that wrong in every context, right?
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.380]   CEOs, leaders, you flail.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.860]   That most people are looking for just symbolically
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.260]   and actually for you to show up
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.580]   and identify that you're here, that you're in charge.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.620]   So whatever situation I find myself in,
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.860]   even in a personal crisis, I say, "Am I showing up?"
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.700]   And showing up personally means am I facing the thing
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.900]   that is the crisis, right?
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.020]   Back to my earlier statement,
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.260]   if I had one tattoo, it would be face everything.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.420]   So showing up is number one.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.940]   Number two is back to what's the worst possible thing
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.660]   that could happen in this crisis
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.460]   and how would I deal with it if it played out?
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.180]   And what's the likelihood of that playing out?
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.180]   I ask myself those same questions when I'm in a crisis.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.820]   And then three, I look for the silver lining very early.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.500]   This law of physics that every action
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.220]   has an equal and opposite reaction
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.620]   is very much on display in a crisis.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.220]   No matter what happens in this world,
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.380]   when there is a crisis and something bad happens,
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.100]   a portal is gonna open up to a parallel universe
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.060]   where something good is happening as a result.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.900]   Sometimes when that involves pain and suffering,
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.900]   it's very hard to accept
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.180]   and you have to just wait for that to materialize.
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.380]   But when life or death is not on the line,
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.980]   you should give yourself permission to say,
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.300]   okay, I just lost my job, which is a big crisis,
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.380]   but what's the portal
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.380]   that just opened up to a parallel universe?
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.020]   Oh, well, I have nothing to lose.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.100]   Now I'm willing to go all in on being that musician,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.100]   my plan A, right?
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.420]   Now I don't have to settle anymore for Bob's Record Store.
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.940]   And so I do think, again, not in life or death situations,
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.300]   but every time I have a crisis,
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.300]   I get excited by what's the portal, where am I going?
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.380]   What's gonna happen in my life
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.700]   as a result of what just happened?
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.860]   And there's another way to say it.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.580]   Rahm Emanuel said at Mayor of Chicago,
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.020]   never let a crisis go to waste,
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:21.740]   but it's another way of saying what I'm saying.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.740]   But I do talk in a book too
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.460]   about one of the interesting things
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.700]   when you look about crisis
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.620]   and sometimes you assess how you performed,
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.500]   and if you admire how you performed,
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.580]   often the reason is because you had clarity
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.820]   of decision-making and you act decisively
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.180]   'cause you had few choices.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.500]   A lot of my book is about how do you migrate
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.940]   the benefits of crisis decision-making in times of peace
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.940]   so that no one wants to have cortisol
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.300]   flowing through their stomach in order to behave effectively
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.420]   but there is something to be said
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.380]   for the clarity of crisis decision-making
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.740]   and applying it to everyday life.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.900]   - It brings up a good question.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.060]   Let's take someone who's at a job,
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:53.900]   they don't love it,
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.660]   they're trying to figure out what to do next.
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.140]   Do you think the average person is spending too much time
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.820]   trying to make that decision or too little?
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   - I think the average person is spending too much time
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.300]   looking to settle to escape the pain
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.700]   of the current situation
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.180]   and not enough time believing
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.780]   that the right situation is out there
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.780]   and confidently pursuing it.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.620]   I think the same is true of relationships too.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.180]   We wanna relieve the pain of the status quo
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.460]   and therefore we settle
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.580]   and not enough time trying to identify
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.780]   what's the right situation.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.340]   So we tend to repeat the same bad patterns, I believe.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.780]   Most people fall into that trap
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.940]   and that's because you don't value yourself enough.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.460]   You either believe the right situation isn't out there
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.780]   or you believe you don't deserve it,
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.020]   especially true in personal relationships.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.020]   You just like don't know or you don't think you're worthy.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.100]   - Well, on the professional side,
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.740]   I feel quite amped right now.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.020]   I already did the plan A,
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.060]   went all in on the macro idea of what I'm building here,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.860]   but I'm ready to start.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.500]   - You already got your first customer right here
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.540]   and it was effortless and your acquisition cost was zero.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.780]   - Just to be clear, I have had two listeners or readers
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.380]   use this feature on the newsletter.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.380]   I think both of them said,
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.300]   I'll pay $100 a year for a membership,
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.260]   you just have to build it.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.820]   So technically Matt, unfortunately you are customer three.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.060]   Huge shout out to customers one and two.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.380]   - Chris, I have news for you.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.100]   I'm willing to pay 400 for the premium membership.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.940]   - Okay.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:17.060]   - So I am technically still the first premium member
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.700]   as I have upsold myself.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.820]   (laughing)
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.260]   - Tier two.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.100]   - See, this is what happens
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.900]   when we commit to plan A publicly on a podcast.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.100]   - So I'm excited to do that.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.860]   I guess I should probably commit myself
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.340]   to this even further and say,
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.660]   if you go to allthehacks.com/join,
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.380]   I'm gonna put up a page where anyone listening
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.780]   can join a membership that I will create.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.700]   And the one thing that I will commit to having in it now,
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:40.620]   there's not a lot of features,
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.340]   is I'm gonna do a once a month call just for members,
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.660]   Zoom call, you can join, ask anything,
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.060]   we can talk about anything.
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.180]   I'm not gonna record it.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.660]   I'm not gonna put it out to everyone.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.940]   We'll at least do that.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.940]   The goal in the long run is to build a real membership,
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.940]   to have perks and benefits.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.940]   I have some crazy ideas on travel.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.860]   I'll talk about them in that first Zoom call.
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.220]   But if you go to that page,
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.220]   I will set something up by the time this airs.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.660]   - Wait, can we use this as a case study though?
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.060]   'Cause one thing we didn't get into
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.340]   is something I talk into my book
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.220]   about the loneliness of being on the bleeding edge
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.580]   and what happens when you have a revelation
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.780]   or an epiphany like you've had with this membership idea,
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.140]   which I think is fantastic.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.540]   But let's say I was neutral.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.140]   What happens is the relationship
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.300]   between the magnitude of an opportunity
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.220]   and the amount of data there is to support it is inverse,
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.380]   which makes sense, right?
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:27.300]   If you have a really great idea and only you see
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.980]   because you're so early,
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.100]   there's not gonna be any data out there to support it.
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.300]   And two, if you rely on your friend group
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.140]   or family group or whatever to validate it,
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.460]   they're not gonna be able to see what you see
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.460]   'cause it's your epiphany.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.020]   At the same time, those are actually confirmatory
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.140]   that it's a big opportunity,
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.380]   unless you're crazy or delusional,
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.820]   because only you are putting the pieces together.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.540]   And I think what happens is oftentimes
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.300]   where people sit where you sit, wait a second,
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.500]   why is there only AARP?
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.820]   There should be a membership group.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.180]   What is it about being 65
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.460]   that makes you wanna belong things?
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:56.340]   That's not true.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.700]   I would love a group where I get benefits, right?
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.460]   What happens a lot of times, Chris,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.660]   is now a person will road test it
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.700]   with their peer group or their friend group.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.300]   And if they surrounded themselves
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.980]   with people who are risk adverse,
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.740]   or maybe they don't have their best interest at heart,
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.860]   the idea dies with those groups.
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.700]   So I talk in my book a lot about,
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.420]   make sure that when you have a nascent idea
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.420]   that you one, cradle it,
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.940]   but two, consult agenda-less supporters
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.980]   or what I call pragmatic optimists,
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.460]   people who are wired to be optimistic, but pragmatic,
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.100]   so they can give you real data.
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.220]   But it's really important to sit with this idea
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.660]   that when you have a big opportunity, a big idea,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.540]   there isn't gonna be the data
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.060]   or the affirmation to support it in the early days,
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.980]   and don't let it die at that point.
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.500]   'Cause the best innovations in life are gut sandwiches.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.660]   They began with intuition, like you just had,
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.540]   a little bit of data, AARP, the thing exists,
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.940]   but you're gonna launch this based on intuition
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.300]   and my early membership fee of $400.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.180]   Last point on this,
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.220]   'cause Chris is about to start this journey.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.940]   My number one advice to you is opportunity arrives
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.740]   before the tipping point of evidence.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.500]   So don't be afraid.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.540]   If you trust your instincts and your intuition,
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.660]   if it's a great idea, you'll figure it out
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.900]   the same way Chris is gonna figure out
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.500]   with his new membership group.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.580]   Do we have a name?
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.260]   I mean, the whole thing's under all the hacks,
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.100]   so it's gonna be there.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.100]   We'll see where it evolves.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.980]   I have ideas of everyone joining
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.100]   can be a sub-agent of a travel agency.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.940]   People are gonna be able to build this with me.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.900]   One other thing I'll add is a feature.
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:21.140]   I'm gonna float to all members, the upcoming guests.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.220]   So you would have gotten a message that Matt's coming on,
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.540]   we're gonna talk about this.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.780]   I'm gonna let you guys also be a part in,
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:28.380]   what should we talk about with this person?
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.980]   What topics should we discuss?
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:31.620]   So I'm gonna bring you in as members
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.620]   to part of what we're building.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.420]   So there's a feature ad right now
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.500]   for members of this already announced,
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.420]   by the time you hear it, membership.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.860]   Exciting, I can't wait.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:40.700]   All right, awesome.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.020]   We did some work today.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:42.860]   Love it.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.500]   So if anyone listening right now has a thing,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.980]   whether it's a new career path, a new job, anything,
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.500]   my strong recommendation is to check out the book
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.820]   and maybe you can burn your own boat
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.780]   like I just did on this episode.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.180]   We're all in on a membership.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.500]   We'll see where it goes.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:00.220]   Where can people find anything about what you're working on?
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.900]   I know you've got some cool bonuses on the book online.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.940]   Where should people go?
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.700]   Yeah, I have a website, burntheboatsbook.com.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.180]   I tend to spend a lot of time on LinkedIn.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.500]   So find me there.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.580]   If you read the book, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.740]   Feedback is amazing.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.980]   So Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Goodreads,
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.300]   wherever it is you spend your time, that would be great.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.580]   Also tells me which themes I should be building upon
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.420]   and expanding upon.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.260]   So thank you.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.620]   So leave a review for the book,
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:24.700]   just like I always ask everyone
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.980]   to leave a review for the podcast.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:26.940]   I know it's really important.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.300]   I will go leave you a review after this.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.140]   Thanks for being here.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:30.980]   Thank you.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.260]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.020]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.140]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:40.940]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.660]   I would really appreciate it.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.100]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.460]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:50.740]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:51.820]   That's it for this week.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:53.020]   I'll see you next week.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.760]   (bubbles popping)
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.600]   (bubbles popping)
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.440]   (bubbles popping)
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.500]   you
