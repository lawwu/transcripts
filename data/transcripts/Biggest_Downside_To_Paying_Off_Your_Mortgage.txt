[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode I want to specifically
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.120]   talk about paying down mortgage debt or investing.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   It's a favorite topic that definitely generates a lot of opinions and a lot of emotion too
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.520]   for some reason.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.400]   Debt can help us get wealthier and live a better life, but also debt can ruin us and
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.640]   make us feel not so good, stressed, take jobs that we otherwise wouldn't want because we
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   have to pay off this debt.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.040]   I think most of us take on a mortgage because we simply cannot afford to buy a home in cash.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.400]   We just want to live larger than we can really afford, but thanks to innovation of the financial
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.800]   services industry, we're able to take on different types of mortgages, ARMs, which are my favorite,
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.260]   15-year fixed mortgages looking the best right now in terms of what you're seeing on the
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.640]   averages for the 30-year, 15-year, and ARMs.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.000]   Then of course, the 30-year fixed mortgage where I don't think anybody should really
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.800]   take because the average duration someone lives in a home is about 9 to 10 years.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.520]   In other words, in 9 to 10 years, the home is sold or the mortgage is paid off somehow
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   somewhere.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.040]   Therefore, it doesn't make sense to take out a longer term duration loan at a higher rate.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.640]   It's an unnecessary expense in my opinion.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.320]   Further, interest rates have been coming down for over 35 years now.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.120]   What makes you think interest rates are suddenly going to shoot back up now that we have technology,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.960]   information efficiency, experience managing inflation and unemployment in previous cycles,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.400]   and a coordinated Federal Reserve, international coordination of central banks around the world?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.640]   Interest rates are not going to be rocketing higher anytime soon, I don't think in our
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.600]   lifetimes, therefore, you want to try to at least match the fixed rate duration to the
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.840]   time you plan to own the home or keep the mortgage.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.720]   Given mortgage rates have collapsed since the start of the pandemic, it's very logical
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.560]   to see demand for real estate go up and refinancing going up and mortgages being held on for a
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.600]   longer duration of time.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.320]   If you've got a 2.5% mortgage or lower, it's hard to get really motivated to pay it off
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.920]   because when you compare it to, let's say, the S&P 500 dividend yield at around 1.8%,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.840]   maybe it's 1.6% now, that spread is not very high.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.520]   But if you compare it to the 10-year bond yield, which is at around 1 to 1.2%, a 2.5%
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.580]   mortgage is more than twice that.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.520]   Investing is relative in finance.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.680]   We're all trying to figure out how to best maximize and utilize our capital.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.760]   Since we don't have endless amount of money like Elon Musk, we always have to decide,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.600]   do we put that $1 to paying down debt or do we put that $1 to investing?
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.080]   And I did talk about creating a system called the Financial Samurai Debt and Investment
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.720]   Ratio.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.480]   It helps you pay down debt or invest based on what the interest rate is.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.440]   So for example, if the interest rate is at 3%, I think you use 30% of your free cash
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.680]   flow to pay down debt.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.780]   If the interest rate is at 8%, you would spend 80%.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.520]   So it's whatever the interest rate is times 10%.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.920]   And if you have interest rate above 10%, you spend all of your free cash flow paying down
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.600]   debt because that is a really great return on any investment 10% or higher.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   So I want to share with you what I think is the biggest downside to paying off debt.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.120]   And the biggest downside is losing a tremendous amount of motivation to hustle, to work hard,
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.520]   and to grow your wealth once your debt is paid off, once that mortgage is paid off.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.480]   If you think about it, once you don't have a mortgage, living is pretty cheap, right?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   You've got your property taxes, your insurance, your normal maintenance expenses, but they're
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.100]   not that great.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.460]   Food is relatively cheap in America.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.060]   That's why most of us eat a lot of food and are larger than we should be.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.300]   There's plenty of free or cheap entertainment.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.120]   You know, Netflix is like $15 a month for like the high-end package.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.820]   You can just get entertained for countless of hours.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.600]   You can go walk in the park, you can play tennis, hit softballs, whatever it is.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.980]   Life is pretty manageable once you don't have a mortgage.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.920]   And so when you don't have that mortgage, any rational person will think, "Well, why
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.620]   bother working so hard at work?
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.180]   Why bother trying to get a raise and a promotion?
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.160]   Why bother trying to start a side hustle or risk a lot of money and time and heartache
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   starting a business?"
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.740]   Now, of course, everybody has different levels of motivation, different engines, if you will,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.020]   of motivation.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.720]   Some of you are just inherently motivated all the darn time, which is great, which is
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.580]   probably why you're probably going to do pretty well.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.180]   For me, I had a lot of motivation growing up because I grew around a lot of poverty
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.980]   living in Zambia and Malaysia and also Taiwan.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.100]   But it was really Malaysia and going to visit India and China in the '90s and the early
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.380]   2000s that really motivated me to try to make more money so I wouldn't fall into poverty.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.600]   And just seeing the world, seeing how much poverty out there is really a fantastic motivator
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.420]   to work hard and not take your life in America or whatever developed country you're listening
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.220]   to this podcast from for granted.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.900]   I definitely plan to take my kids to a developing country and to live simply at least for a
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.220]   summer or two and just see, "Look, life isn't as great as America or how we live everywhere
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.220]   in the world.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.140]   Don't take your parents, your house, your friends, your environment for granted."
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.060]   I mean, if you go to India, even right now, the pollution is terrible.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.060]   Same thing in China.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.580]   And you come to most places in America and we can breathe amazing fresh air.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.820]   However, over time, that motivation tends to fade if you are making more money, saving
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.780]   more money and building your wealth.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.060]   I think it's really natural to start losing that desire to stay back two hours after your
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.980]   boss leaves to try to help the firm and help the colleagues and to try to get paid and
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.300]   promoted.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.580]   That hunger just fades.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.180]   I remember back in, it was like 2014 and 2015, I was doing some part-time consulting.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.500]   One was for Personal Capital, the app that I've been using and recommending on Financial
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   Samurai since 2012.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.380]   I thought that was pretty cool, consulting in the marketing department at a series, I
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.220]   think it was a series C company at that time.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.580]   And then I decided, "You know what?
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.580]   In 2015, I'm going to pay off my mortgage.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.860]   I've had this rental property mortgage since 2003 and I just don't want it anymore."
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.260]   There was about $91,000 left on the mortgage.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:24.300]   So I said, "I'm going to try to make more money in 2015 so I can pay off the mortgage
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.420]   that year with new active income, not passive income."
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.100]   So what did I do?
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.780]   I decided to find two more consulting gigs.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.660]   So for three months in a row, three months in a row, I had three consulting gigs.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.900]   I was working about 60 hours a week and I think I was making about $30,000 to $33,000
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.900]   a month.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.580]   And that's a lot of money.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.820]   That was a lot of money, but I was motivated.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.060]   I was hungry to pay down that mortgage.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.060]   And then guess what?
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.820]   As soon as I paid down that mortgage in 2015, I dropped my consulting gigs.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.140]   I didn't look for new ones.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.660]   I also decided to go traveling internationally with my wife for weeks.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.580]   Then I went to the US Open, the tennis open in New York City for a couple of weeks.
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.020]   I just basically kicked back.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.020]   I was tired.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:20.020]   It was kind of like the day or the month really after studying hard for a final exam.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.540]   All my motivation to make extra money went away because there was no more mortgage.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.980]   Not only was there no more mortgage, it also meant that the rental income that I was receiving
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.500]   at the time, more of it went into my pocket.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.300]   So I had more cashflow.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.420]   In a way, it's kind of like a double whammy against motivation.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.080]   One, I have no more mortgage and two, I have higher cashflow.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.980]   So when you have both of these things, you naturally just relax and you say, "Hey, life
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.140]   is pretty easy now, folks.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.660]   Let's just go slack off and do whatever it is you want to do."
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:00.240]   Now in early 2019, I was able to buy a house with cash, so no mortgage.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.300]   And because of that, I really took my sweet time cleaning up the house to prepare it to
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.300]   find new renters.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:12.600]   And I even rejected completely qualified renters who were going to pay $150 more a month because
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.520]   I just didn't get a great feeling about them.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.940]   I wanted to find the ultimate tenants and hopefully I have, but I won't know for sure
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.820]   for one or two years down the road.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.740]   But because of this, because of the lack of mortgage, I gave up $2,500 or a little bit
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.820]   more over the course of the year because I didn't hustle as hard as I would have if I
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.660]   did have a mortgage.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.500]   So if you're thinking about paying down your mortgage, I would follow the FSDR methodology.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.860]   My mortgage now for my primary residence is at 2.125%.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:54.300]   Therefore I'm going to use about 20%, 21% of my cash flow each month to pay down some
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   of my mortgage.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:02.140]   And I'm going to use 79 to 80% of my cash flow to basically invest in stocks and new
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.380]   real estate.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:10.300]   I'm always on the outlook because I think 2021, 2022 are going to be rebound years,
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.160]   so there's going to be opportunity.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.540]   But it's important for all of us to try to forecast when we no longer have the desire
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.540]   to do anything, to do anything that makes money, to do anything productive.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.020]   We just want to really kick back, play golf, sit on the beach, do nothing and live the
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.020]   good life.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.380]   And so you've got to forecast when that'll be.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.500]   I think we're all probably going to do a little bit of something, but we're trying to forecast
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.180]   when the majority of our motivation will dissipate for making money.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.940]   And so when that date is set, that is when I think you should be mortgage free.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.180]   The matching of that timeline is a little bit tricky.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.380]   That's why we should always try to be investing and paying off debt as we go.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:01.340]   My motivation to get my finances right and to protect my capital and to continue growing
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.740]   passive income is still there.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.900]   And the reason why it's still there is because I have two young kids.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.100]   And so each kid, funny enough, feels like a mortgage.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.260]   They provide me a lot of motivation.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.020]   So I'd love to hear from you guys.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.300]   What do you think about the biggest downside of paying off your mortgage?
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.980]   Since our personal capital, our own human capital is generally what makes us the most
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.860]   amount of money.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.740]   Doesn't it make sense that once you have an easy life and you don't have any mortgage
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.500]   debt, that you would naturally take a step back?
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.800]   I'd love to know what are your motivations?
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:45.660]   What keeps your engine humming to wake up at 5 a.m., to work harder than your peers,
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.020]   to start a side hustle?
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.580]   What is that motivating factor?
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:55.020]   Because I've been asking a lot of entrepreneurs and people who make a decent amount of money
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.740]   and probably have great net worths, what drives them?
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.860]   Because I'm personally struggling with figuring out why bother trying so hard now.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.420]   There's always an endless amount of money to make.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.960]   Once you think you're going to be happy making 100 grand, 250, 500, whatever it is, once
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.260]   you get there, you're going to realize, "Hmm, why not just try to make more?"
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:23.560]   It's one of those never-ending traps that I tried to get out of in 2012, leaving the
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   finance industry.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.700]   I just didn't care anymore.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.580]   The problem is I'm feeling a little bit like this again online.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   There's an endless amount of money to make online as well.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.100]   I just am trying to find how much is enough and how you all, if you guys can provide me
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.220]   some feedback, how did you find you're enough?
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.940]   Or is it impossible to find it?
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.540]   Are you never going to be satisfied?
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.740]   All right, that wraps things up for this episode.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.700]   If you like the episode, I'd appreciate a positive review and some nice comments.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.820]   Until next time, I'll talk to you guys later.
