[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   - And the nozzle, so as you're saying,
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.640]   there's a bunch of different design options,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.680]   but it's a critical part of this,
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.240]   how you do that conversion.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.680]   - Just basically like how much can you convert
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.240]   is really like the ultimate game.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.480]   How much pressure and heat can we convert into thrust?
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.560]   Like that's really, at the end of the day,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.120]   that's what a rocket engine is.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.840]   - The following is a conversation with Tim Dodd,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.160]   host of the Everyday Astronaut YouTube channel,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.440]   where he educates and inspires all of us
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.040]   with detailed but accessible explanations
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.200]   of rocket engines and all things space travel.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.560]   in the description.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.340]   And now, dear friends, here's Tim Dodd.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.680]   Can you give a brief history of SpaceX rockets?
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   So we've got Falcon 1, Falcon 9,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.480]   there's different versions of those, Falcon Heavy,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.160]   Starship, and also the Dragon Castles and so on.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.720]   - Well, yeah, Falcon 1 is where it all started.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.760]   The original intent and the original idea of SpaceX
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.960]   was Elon wanted to try to get something to Mars.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.120]   He saw that NASA didn't have a current Mars plan
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.360]   and he wanted to go to Mars,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.480]   so he decided how do I best do this?
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.920]   He literally wanted to, at first,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.000]   purchase a rocket from Russia.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.860]   Then after a foiled attempt at doing that,
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.920]   he decided that he was gonna try to develop his own rocket.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.280]   And the Falcon 1 is what came out of that process.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.720]   And he developed a pretty incredible team.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.560]   I don't know how exactly he stumbled upon the team
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.160]   that he stumbled upon that quickly,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.360]   but the people that he assembled were amazing.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.560]   And they built the Falcon 1,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.640]   which was a single Merlin engine
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640]   followed by an upper stage engine called the Kestrel engine.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.400]   Pretty small compared to the things
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   they're working on today,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.360]   but that Merlin engine continued to evolve
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.680]   into being the power plant for the Falcon 9.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.180]   They went from a small lift launch vehicle
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.900]   up into the medium class launch vehicle
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.900]   so they could provide services for NASA.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.780]   That's one of the big things
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.100]   they first kind of hung their hat up
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.900]   was they got the opportunity to fly cargo
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.620]   to the International Space Station
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.340]   under originally it was called the COTS program,
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.260]   the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services for NASA,
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.980]   which evolved into the Commercial Resupply Contracts.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.900]   And that's when SpaceX developed both their Dragon capsule,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.060]   which is a uncrewed at first spacecraft
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.140]   that can dock to the ISS and the Falcon 9 rocket
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.260]   that can take it to the International Space Station.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.460]   - And the Dragon rides on,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.740]   it's the thing up top that rides on the big booster thing
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.980]   that launches it into orbit.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.560]   - Exactly, yep, the Falcon 9's the semi truck,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.700]   the Dragon capsule's the payload.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.100]   It's the thing being dropped off basically at its destination
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.100]   and in this case,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.600]   the destination is the International Space Station.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.220]   And yeah, so they developed those relatively quickly
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.460]   and became a commercial success before you know it.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.420]   They're now the number one launch provider in the world,
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.340]   launching more mass to orbit than anybody else,
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.260]   launching more frequently than countries,
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.940]   like the entire country of China
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.420]   who's going crazy right now with launches.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.260]   Granted, China beat them by two launches this last in 2022,
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.420]   but prior year, SpaceX beat the entire country of China.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.740]   I mean, it's nuts.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.620]   - And just like you said,
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.820]   SpaceX still beats China even this year
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.740]   in terms of the amount of payload that was done.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.020]   So all of the-- - The mass to orbit.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.540]   - Yeah, the mass to orbit, right.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.540]   That China had like 60 something, a couple more launches,
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.220]   but there was just like small CubeSat type of launches.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.380]   - Exactly, some of them were literally like 100 kilograms
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.460]   or something, you know, like not large payloads.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.660]   And so SpaceX customers are different,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260]   so whoever wants to send payloads up into space.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.180]   - Yes, but right now their biggest customer
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.100]   is actually themselves with Starlink.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.300]   One of the biggest reasons they've launched
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.540]   so much mass to orbit is 'cause Starlink is designed
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.420]   around the payload fairing and the payload capabilities
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.940]   of the Falcon 9 rocket.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.780]   So, you know, because they're vertically integrated,
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.220]   because they build their own satellites,
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.940]   because they're building their own rocket,
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.260]   they can literally design a system that's, you know,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.500]   another manufacturer might've made a more square satellite
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.780]   that was heavier or something,
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.140]   but SpaceX looked at it from a blank slate and said,
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.860]   here's our constraints, our payload mass constraints,
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.700]   our volume constraints,
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.100]   and they made a funky looking satellite.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.380]   Things like the size of a, you know,
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.980]   it's like a table folded up,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.460]   which isn't anything I've really ever seen before.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.380]   So, but it's purpose built to fit as efficiently as possible
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.660]   inside their fairing and inside the capabilities
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.500]   of that rocket.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.960]   So therefore, because they're launching those,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.580]   like an insane amount, you know, dozen, you know,
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.380]   40, 50 times a year or whatever,
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.860]   they're just putting up insane amounts of mass,
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.860]   like we've never seen before.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.020]   - What about the different versions of Falcon 9,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.940]   so we can linger on them?
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.860]   What are some interesting memories to you
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.900]   of the different developments in Falcon 9?
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.700]   - The very first Falcon 9s had a square array of engines.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.780]   It had like a three by three by three grid
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.420]   of their Merlin one engines, the one Ds.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.100]   And I think it only lasted,
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.460]   I don't remember if it was two or four flights
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.540]   before they went into this OctaWOG configuration,
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.900]   where there's eight, like a ring of eight engines
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   with a center engine in the middle.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.900]   Still in the same diameter, the rocket was,
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300]   the fuselage was more or less the same,
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.260]   3.7 meter wide diameter,
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.300]   but the actual thrust structure changed.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.580]   And one of the big efficiency gains was,
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.500]   you no longer have, you know, a corner engine,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.380]   and then like a edge engine,
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.580]   and then another corner engine.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.320]   You can just make eight of the same, you know,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.580]   kind of part of the OctaWeb, it's called,
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.180]   you know, the same shape.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.940]   And then your interchangeability
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.340]   and your manufacturability becomes a lot simpler.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.100]   So that was kind of one of the bigger upgrades at first.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.940]   And they kept stretching it.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.180]   Every time they like touched this thing,
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.460]   it got longer and like, or taller and taller, technically.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.980]   And then the next big feature that you saw in 2014
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.920]   would have been, they added landing legs
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.680]   to a Falcon 9 rocket, which was,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.700]   I was at, that was the first launch I ever went to,
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.140]   was actually to see, it was CRS-3,
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.420]   so Commercial Resupply Mission 3,
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.500]   and it was probably their,
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.620]   God, I don't remember what that was,
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.300]   like their 14th or 15th launch or something,
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.680]   like pretty early on.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.900]   And people were literally laughing at the idea
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.540]   of them putting landing legs on it.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.380]   They just thought it was stupid.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.620]   They're like, why are they wasting,
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.780]   why is this billionaire Elon Musk guy wasting his time
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.820]   trying to land a rocket?
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.660]   It's not gonna work.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.460]   - So you said the Mars planet was there in the beginning.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.940]   What about the reusability of rockets?
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.420]   Was that there in the beginning?
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.660]   - I think reusability definitely, you know,
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.420]   it's a necessary part of making any kind
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.540]   of interplanetary mission, you know,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.460]   in order to actually do that, just financially,
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.540]   you have to start reusing these things.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.500]   - In terms of the development of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.540]   how early on did the goal of reusing the rocket,
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.380]   having the rocket actually land,
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.180]   how early did that goal creep in?
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.660]   - I can't speak for Elon and SpaceX,
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.460]   but it was pretty, you know,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.940]   immediately they wanted to try to recover,
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.380]   and as a matter of fact, I think the very first
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.940]   two Falcon 9 rockets, and Falcon 1, I think,
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.260]   they even wanted to try to recover using parachutes
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.420]   to recover the first stage.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.400]   And now, fast forward, you know, almost 20 years later,
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.140]   and Rocket Lab is actually doing a concept like that,
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.420]   where they're pulling a parachute
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.540]   after the first stage is reentering,
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.820]   and they actually are trying to recover it
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.660]   with a helicopter, just gonna try to snatch it
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.500]   out of the air.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.340]   They've actually done it.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.020]   They've actually done it successfully once.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.100]   - How does the helicopter grab the rocket?
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.620]   - With this giant, like, drag line and a hook.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.460]   - Oh, wow.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.660]   - And then it literally just, like,
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.020]   grabs, snags onto the parachute.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.820]   - Wow. - And it's pretty amazing.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.260]   But this is a small rocket.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.180]   Their rocket's only about a metric ton.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.700]   The booster is empty.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   - So the rocket releases parachutes, like, really high up.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.780]   I would love to see this.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.980]   - Yeah. - It's an interesting idea.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.540]   There's so many interesting ideas and possibilities.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.140]   Like, SpaceX basically just innovated
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.740]   a lot of different weird ideas,
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.300]   just in the pursuit of making things more efficient,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.620]   reusable, all of that.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.220]   So basically, thinking from first principles
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.340]   how to solve this problem.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.660]   And so what you find is, like,
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.060]   you'll get all of these kind of crazy kind of solutions.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.640]   - And with SpaceX, they weren't even getting to the point
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.980]   of the booster surviving reentry long enough
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.260]   to be able to pull the parachutes.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.100]   - Yeah. - You know,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.860]   their mass fractions, you know, and that varies.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.180]   Every single rocket's different.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.900]   You know, all the, you know, for instance,
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.100]   Rocket Lab uses carbon composite fuselage and tanks,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.340]   or, you know, same thing.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.220]   And that's very, very lightweight,
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.180]   has really good mass fractions,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.500]   and therefore their drag coefficients and things like that,
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.740]   they were able to survive reentry of the first stage,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.900]   which is something that SpaceX
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.060]   wasn't able to do at the time.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.820]   What's, what the, kind of the big, I think,
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.420]   breakthrough for SpaceX with reusing the booster
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.780]   is they realized we have to basically slow down
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.260]   before we hit the atmosphere.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.420]   - Yeah. - So they actually do
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.220]   what they used to call a reentry burn,
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.660]   which I still think is the correct term,
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.060]   'cause it is reentering the atmosphere.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.940]   But now they call it the entry burn,
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.820]   and they light up three of the nine Merlin engines,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   not only to slow it down,
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.580]   but actually even while those engines are firing,
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.460]   it creates like a literal like force field
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.540]   as it's falling through the atmosphere.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.740]   - Interesting.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.940]   - But it also decreases the velocity by almost half,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.580]   or around half, and then that therefore decreases
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.300]   the amount of, you know, the biggest thing
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.340]   with the atmosphere is that as it gets compressed
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.540]   against the front of any,
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.900]   anything flying through the atmosphere,
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.140]   the compressed atoms just get hot,
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.940]   and they can get so hot they turn into a plasma,
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.140]   and they get so hot they can just absolutely
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.940]   destroy anything.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.100]   So they slow down enough that the air molecules
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.140]   don't end up, you know, destroying the vehicle on reentry.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.860]   And then they realized, I think at some point,
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.980]   it was probably a similar crossover,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.580]   they're like, well, if we're lighting the engines already
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.940]   to slow down the atmosphere,
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.140]   we can just use that same engine to land.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.220]   And so like, well, what if we just stuck landing legs on it
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.300]   and just landed the thing vertically?
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.620]   And next thing you know is December 21st, 2015,
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.380]   they did exactly that for the first time.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.220]   - The first time.
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.220]   So you were there before that then, right?
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.900]   - In 2014.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.740]   - Yep, early 2014.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.380]   So that, and for me, like, that was so fun watching,
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.860]   you know, that was like the peak of me
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.780]   just becoming obsessed with this idea.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.180]   I'm watching, with, like, and back in the day,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.020]   it was like months between launches, you know?
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.260]   So a launch was like a big idea.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.100]   I'd wake up at 3 a.m. to watch this landing attempt
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.940]   or whatever, you know?
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.300]   Every, you know, there's CRS-4 almost landed,
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.900]   CRS-5 almost landed, CRS-6, CRS-7 blew up.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.060]   I was watching that on,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.660]   I think it was like a Saturday morning
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.580]   or maybe a Sunday morning.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.780]   And I remember watching that and watched it blow up.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.660]   And I was like, oh my God, now what?
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.620]   You know, and it blew up on ascent.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.580]   It was their first failure.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.780]   So it was their 18th flight, I believe.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.660]   CRS-7, the upper stage, had one of the bottlers,
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.940]   bottles inside the tanks that are filled with helium.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.420]   And one of those bottles broke off on ascent
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.900]   and actually just completely overpressured
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.740]   the upper stage.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.560]   And the upper stage blew up
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.060]   and the whole rocket went kaboom in an uncontrolled manner.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.860]   And so then they came back with vengeance.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.780]   And when they came back, the first mission back
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.260]   is the first time that they landed a rocket,
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.080]   which was awesome.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.180]   So the return to flight after the anomaly was, yeah,
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.260]   was landing a rocket.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.380]   - And stuck the landing.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.220]   - Yep, nailed it.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.300]   - Well, actually, the first time.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.900]   So the first time you were there, what was that like?
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.620]   What do you remember from that day?
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.900]   - Just, I was surprised at how much bigger
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.580]   the rocket was than I imagined.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.060]   I was, I originally, when I was going down
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.780]   to Kennedy Space Center, I was disappointed
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.260]   that I wasn't seeing like a, you know,
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.700]   I didn't know a ton about rockets.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.140]   I knew enough to like know what a space shuttle was,
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.060]   what like the Saturn V was, you know,
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.420]   but that was probably about the end of my knowledge.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.180]   I just remember being disappointed
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.980]   that I wasn't seeing a big, quote unquote,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.700]   NASA rocket flying.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.780]   You know, I was thinking in my head like,
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.700]   oh, I'm gonna see this launch.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.380]   It's probably gonna be like, you know,
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.980]   three stories tall or something, you know,
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.860]   just some little skinny little stick
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.380]   and some little firecracker and yay, you know.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.660]   I think I'd almost been pitched that too.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.280]   I think the people that I was working for at the time,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.780]   I think they kind of were downplaying it as like,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.260]   well, it's not a big rocket, sir.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.420]   It's not gonna be that exciting, you know.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.060]   But we get out there to the pad and I'm like,
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.460]   this thing's huge.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.820]   This is not a small rocket.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.580]   Like this is, it's, you know, it's 70 meters tall,
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.020]   220 feet tall.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.420]   It's huge.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.780]   And I think people forget like the scale of that, you know.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.180]   It might look skinny and tall and all this stuff,
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.220]   but it's still a very, very large piece of machinery.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.860]   It's physically about as large as you can ship.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.300]   The booster's about as big as you can ship
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.740]   across the country, period,
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.820]   without like completely shutting down highways.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.100]   You know, it is made within those exact specifications
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.740]   of like having, you know, lane privileges
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.840]   and bridges and everything.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.420]   It's, you know, 12 feet wide, 3.7 meters wide,
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.500]   and it's 45 meters long.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.620]   So it's like exactly what you can fit
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.060]   with a pretty standard, you know,
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.860]   like before you start getting into crazy amounts
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.060]   of problems shipping the rocket.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.900]   And it's huge.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.740]   It's huge.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.900]   And people just don't understand that.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.420]   And so when I saw it with my own eyes,
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.740]   I remember just being like,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.620]   this is so much cooler than I thought.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.300]   - Is it hard to believe that that thing
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   is gonna have to lift off the ground
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.860]   and launch up into the air?
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.060]   Maybe that's the most humbling aspect of it.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.700]   That's something that size.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.580]   Humans have come up with a way to take something that size
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.020]   and launching, launch it up into the air.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.420]   - Yeah, there's certainly a very humbling aspect
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.980]   when you watch it actually leave.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.540]   - Was there a sound to it?
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.540]   Was there like a feel?
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.700]   What were the different experiences you first remember?
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.540]   - Well, ironically,
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.500]   I didn't end up getting to see that one fly.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.380]   - Oh. - I went home.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.220]   My camera saw it.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.780]   I left my camera out there,
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.900]   like a remote triggered camera.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.260]   My first images as a launch photographer at the time
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.580]   was CRS-3, but I went home.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   It scrubbed too many times.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.420]   This is back in the day,
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.380]   they were scrubbing like often,
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.380]   and there'd be like a three day, five day, seven day.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.620]   You just never knew.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.820]   So I go home and I watched the live stream of it.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.620]   So I didn't even get to experience my first launch.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.500]   And anyone that's ever tried to go to a launch
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.700]   can probably empathize because yeah,
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.420]   scrubs are very common in the spaceflight world.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.060]   So that one, I didn't get to see.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.220]   But since then, obviously,
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.260]   I've been able to attend very many launches.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.100]   - How much do you understand the control involved
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.940]   in the landing?
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.940]   How difficult is that problem?
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.100]   - I couldn't tell you a single thing about like the code
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.420]   and like the avionics behind it,
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.100]   but I can tell you all the hardware that makes it happen,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.980]   if that helps.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.940]   - Well, that, I mean, to me,
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.380]   it seems like whenever I talk to people,
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.420]   they say it's not that big of a deal
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.820]   in terms of the level of intelligence in the control.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.640]   But to me, it's just like when you observe it,
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.060]   it seems incredible.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.420]   'Cause all the variables involved,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.100]   all the uncertainties involved,
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.380]   all the, 'cause there's aerodynamics.
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.540]   I mean, like there's different temperatures.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.420]   There's so much going on with the fuel,
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.500]   the burning, the combustion,
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.260]   just everything that's going on
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.460]   to be able to perform control at such high stakes
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.300]   effectively, like, you know,
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.340]   that code is probably not written in JavaScript,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.540]   I guess is what I'm saying.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.340]   - Actually, no, I don't, if I remember,
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.820]   I, again, this is well outside of my domain,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.100]   but they're coding in a common language.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.940]   It's--
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.860]   - It's probably gonna be C.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.180]   - Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.540]   And that was one of the things that was weird
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.820]   is that Elon, when he started SpaceX,
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.460]   was like, "We're just gonna code in the most common language
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.300]   "so that we don't have to like have people learn
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.500]   "this archaic, you know, weird thing.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.300]   "And we can just literally pull people off the streets
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.580]   "and be like, here, write it."
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.420]   You know, and--
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.420]   - Yeah, it's probably C++.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.740]   I mean, it'd be epic if it was like Python or something,
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.420]   but I don't, I think like reliable systems
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.700]   have to be written in C, C++ probably,
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.140]   which is a common language, which is something.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.820]   I imagine like NASA engineers would probably have to use
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.700]   some kind of proprietary language in the olden days
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.260]   for security, for privacy, all that kind of stuff.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.220]   - Oh, in the olden, old, old days,
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.900]   like they were inventing code and language from scratch.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.860]   For sure.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.340]   - But still, it's just still incredible
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.420]   that it's able to do that.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.900]   Like, just the feat of engineering involved is just,
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.460]   it's truly, it's like one of the marvels to observe
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.460]   about these rockets coming back to Earth
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.940]   that they're able to land.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.740]   Like, the drama of it is just incredible to see.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.180]   - Yeah, well, one of the fun things to remember, too,
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.220]   with, specifically with the Falcon 9 and the Falcon 9,
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.500]   or Falcon Heavy boosters, I mean,
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.660]   it's the same thing, basically,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.340]   they shut down all but one of the nine engines.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.860]   And even with that one engine
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.620]   at its minimum throttle setting,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.220]   it's still too much thrust to hover.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.260]   So as this rocket's coming down,
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.380]   if they start a little bit too early,
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.120]   if they light that engine too early,
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.180]   it will actually stop above the ground
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.780]   and will not be able to lower itself.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.660]   It will literally stop, like, say,
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.540]   I'm gonna say it stopped 200 feet above the ground,
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.900]   their only option is to kill the engine,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.920]   and then it's just gonna fall those 200 feet.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.260]   So it's what we call a suicide burn or a hover slam,
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.340]   kind of interchangeable terms,
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.220]   because your thrust to weight ratio is never below one.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.500]   So they have to actually literally be riding the throttle.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.160]   So what you do is you kind of start,
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.260]   ideally, you kind of start in the middle
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.580]   of your window of throttle range.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.760]   So let's pretend your engine can throttle down to 40%
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.380]   of its maximum rated thrust.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.700]   You might start at, like, 70% of thrust
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.660]   in the middle of that window of where it could burn.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.420]   So if all of a sudden it's kind of coming in too hot,
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.860]   you have room to throttle up.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.860]   If you're coming in too, you're actually, you know,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.260]   a little too early, you throttle it down.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.660]   You have a little bit of wiggle room.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.340]   It's just amazing how smoothly and how perfectly
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.060]   they're able to still control that thing,
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.020]   even though they're down to one engine out of the nine,
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.940]   and they're still riding, like,
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.340]   the finest margin of what's possible.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.660]   And they're continually playing with that to try to get it,
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.860]   'cause every bit of fuel they're using
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.060]   and propellant they're using to land
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.380]   is propellant they weren't using
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.340]   to put something into space.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.540]   So they want that to be as efficient as possible.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.660]   So they're really, like, watching them hone that in
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.780]   and just continue to evolve and edit that
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.020]   and just get it to be the workhorse.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.200]   We're coming up on 100 consecutive landings,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.620]   perfect landings, 100.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.740]   I think they've done, like, 150-something landings
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.680]   altogether, 160 altogether.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.500]   But we're talking, like, in a row without blowing up,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.180]   which, you know, five years ago
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.360]   was completely experimental and insane.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.380]   And now we're coming up to the point
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.780]   where we're 100 in a row.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.300]   It's like, this is becoming more reliable.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.860]   And the landing, which is not the primary mission,
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.980]   this is purely for SpaceX's, like, gain,
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.380]   is to recover the booster.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.760]   It has nothing to do with the effect
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.640]   of getting the payload on orbit, you know, most of the time.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.020]   And the landing is really only
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.020]   for their benefit and their gain.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.040]   - Long-term gain.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.900]   Like, it's a long-term investment
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.980]   in being able to recover the boosters.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.900]   - 100%. - Can you believe
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.060]   all this was done in basically 10 years?
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.620]   So we've seen this development over a period of 10 years.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.460]   - Oh, man. - So, like,
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.460]   we started commercial spaceflight at scale to today,
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.740]   where it's almost starting to be mundane.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.580]   - Yeah.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.420]   - What Falcon 9 is able to do.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.620]   - Yeah.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.700]   I can't really believe it.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.500]   I mean, obviously, even just in the,
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.780]   I think I'm a fairly fair-weather fan,
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.860]   really didn't start paying attention to, like, 2014.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.700]   - Yeah.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.780]   - And just seeing what it was like back then
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.620]   to what it's like, like,
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.740]   I don't watch every launch at all anymore.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.460]   Like, I'll catch the big ones.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.180]   I'll stream some of the really big ones.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.940]   But, like, back in the day, I, like I said,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.100]   would wake up in the middle of the night
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.580]   to catch these streams, or, you know,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.220]   catch these launches and watch 'em,
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.300]   because they were such a big deal,
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   and there's maybe only five of them a year, you know?
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.180]   And so it was a really big deal.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.540]   Nowadays, it's like, oh, yeah,
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.420]   and there's literally, like, two a week on average now.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.000]   It's insane, from SpaceX alone,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.780]   let alone, you know, United Launch Alliance, Rocket Lab,
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.500]   any of the Chinese missions, you know?
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.140]   I mean, all of, there's countless.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.980]   It's insane.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.460]   It's hard to, really, really, really hard to keep up with.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.080]   - I wonder at which point in the future
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.220]   the number of launches to orbit
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.080]   will exceed the number of launches of airplanes,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.260]   like, on the surface of Earth.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.020]   - Yeah, I have to admit, I kind of have a hard time
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.940]   extrapolating out that far.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.940]   You know, there's a lot of people that are, like,
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.660]   big futurists and really do think about, like,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.140]   interplanetary stuff and think about
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.660]   colonizing Mars and stuff.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.460]   I have a hard time predicting, like,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.940]   when Starship's gonna fly, the orbital launch, you know?
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.700]   And that's, like, imminent-ish,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.820]   like, month or two scale timeframe,
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.180]   and yet I'm still, like, I can't tell you when that's gonna,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.980]   I can't tell you anything about, like,
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.340]   when we're gonna land on Mars or what that's,
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.840]   what that economy and what that, you know,
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.940]   the scale of launch operations is gonna look like
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.820]   in order to do that, because it's just so hard.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.100]   I wouldn't have predicted where we're at today
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.380]   five years ago, you know?
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.420]   It's insane.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.260]   It's so hard to predict, and yeah.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.020]   But it's funny, because there's so many, like,
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.220]   new companies starting up trying to predict that,
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.180]   and it's a really exciting, you know,
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.740]   startup culture right now.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.380]   I think when you make certain engineering decisions
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.740]   and hiring decisions and, like, what you focus on
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.340]   in terms of both business and engineering,
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.780]   it's good to think on the scale of 10, 20, 50, 100 years.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.580]   That's one of the things that Elon is exceptionally good at,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.980]   which is asking the question,
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.820]   "Okay, this might seem impossible right now,
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.920]   "but what's the obvious way to do this
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.420]   "if we look out 20 years?"
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.020]   And then you start to make decisions.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.840]   You start to make decisions about robotics,
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.340]   about brain and computer interfaces,
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.740]   about space travel.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.300]   They make a lot of sense when you look at the scale
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.560]   of 10, 20, 50, 100 years, and don't make any sense
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.980]   if you look at the scale of just months.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.060]   But, of course, the actual work of day-to-day
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.620]   is focused on the next few months,
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.580]   'cause there's deadlines, there's missions
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.580]   they have to accomplish.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.340]   Anyway, returning back to the brief history
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.420]   of SpaceX rockets, the Falcon Heavy.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.460]   So what else is there?
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.860]   So we talked about Falcon 9 and the rapid development there.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.420]   What other flavors of Falcon is there,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.020]   and how does that take us to Starship?
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.340]   - Yeah, realistically, the Falcon 9 evolved more or less,
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.980]   kind of just got more powerful and a little bit longer
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.540]   and more capable.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.900]   But nowadays they fly what's called the Block 5,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.260]   even though it's the eighth or ninth iteration
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.780]   of the Falcon 9, but they call it Block 5.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.180]   It's the one that has the black landing legs,
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.540]   the black interstage.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.080]   They have a fleet of roughly 10 or so
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.500]   that are doing the majority of the legwork these days,
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.580]   and they're flying up to 15 times, I think, right now,
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.140]   as the current booster leader.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.620]   They're also recovering the fairings,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.020]   so the nose cone of the rockets are frequently,
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.880]   if not every time, being recovered.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.460]   Same with the booster for the most part.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.380]   And the only thing being expended is the upper stage,
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.380]   and that's kind of where the Falcon 9 is ending.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.020]   It really doesn't make sense to develop
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.580]   that infrastructure any longer,
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.420]   so they went with the next step,
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.020]   which is go even bigger physically,
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   so they have more margin for upper stage reusability.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.940]   And that's what we see with Starship and Super Heavy.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.020]   So the Super Heavy booster, the whole system is confusing.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.160]   The whole system's kind of considered Starship,
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.700]   but technically the Starship is just the upper stage,
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.540]   which is also like the spaceship,
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.360]   which is also the upper stage.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.580]   And then the booster itself
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.880]   is considered the Super Heavy booster.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.980]   And that's what they've been working on.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.860]   Publicly it came out in 2016
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.540]   as the, at the time it was the ITS,
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.820]   the Interplanetary Transportation System.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.620]   Later, and I think about, by the end of that year,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.020]   2017 it kind of became known as the BFR,
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.940]   the big Falcon rocket.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.100]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.940]   And then I think it was about end of 2018
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.900]   they started calling it Starship.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.260]   But that is where we're at today,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.420]   and that's what they're working full steam ahead on.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.820]   - And what about Dragon?
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.600]   We mentioned Dragon, Crew Dragon, Cargo Dragon.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.960]   - Yeah, so they went from the cargo version of Dragon
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.620]   that flew about 20 times
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.900]   successfully to the International Space Station,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.860]   except for that one CRS-7 where the rocket blew up
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.860]   and the capsule obviously didn't make it to the ISS.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.260]   Then they went into the Dragon 2,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.140]   which has two variants.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.180]   It has a crew variant, so we just call it Crew Dragon.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.340]   And then there's the cargo version of Dragon 2.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.500]   And that's just an updated, sleeker,
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.020]   sexier version of Dragon.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.840]   Ironically, it's heavier altogether,
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.880]   so you'll never see those cool return to launch site landing,
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.160]   the boosters coming back to land for CRS missions
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.560]   anymore like we used to.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.720]   But they landed on the drone ship anyway.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.840]   And yeah, that's been flying successfully.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.040]   That's kind of the, so there's Starlink, Dragon,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.200]   Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship system.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.680]   It's kind of the whole SpaceX world, really.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   - In terms of the spaceships involved,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.520]   what to you are some of the major milestones
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.900]   in that history?
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.520]   We kind of mentioned a few.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.600]   - Yeah. - Stick in the landing.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.680]   Is there something that kind of stands out?
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.640]   - Yeah, I would say definitely the big ones, obviously,
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.600]   like any of the first, like the first flight of Falcon 1,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.560]   first flight of Falcon 9,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.440]   first time they went to the International Space Station,
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.760]   the first time they landed a booster,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.160]   the first time they reused a booster,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.560]   which is, I think, about six months after.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.920]   No, it was a year after.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.720]   It was SES 10, 2017.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.000]   It was the first time they reused one of those boosters.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.480]   And that was a big milestone.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.040]   Can we even, yeah, we recovered one.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.520]   We caught one.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.720]   It's like, we got one, now what?
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.080]   That was the first time they reflew one.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   Yeah, then flying humans was a huge one.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.200]   DM-2, Bob and Doug for NASA.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.160]   - Bob and Doug, yeah. - Bob and Doug.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.320]   That was incredible.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.180]   That was a huge, huge step, I think,
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.880]   for SpaceX was flying people.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.240]   - So it's the first major commercial
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.300]   launching of humans out into space.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.640]   - Yeah, and not just into space,
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.440]   'cause there's been people that have done,
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.840]   space flights with suborbital hops,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.520]   but going into orbit, and especially docking
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.000]   and rendezvousing with the International Space Station,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.120]   it's a big deal.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.200]   Until you really understand the physics involved
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.600]   and the scale involved of just crossing the Kármán line,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.000]   going straight up, versus going into orbit,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.240]   they're just completely different things, almost.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.800]   - What about Starship?
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.840]   Are we in a place where we can talk
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.640]   about milestones with Starship?
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.280]   Has there been, or has it just been
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.000]   an epic journey of failure and successes
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.120]   of testing and so on?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   What would you classify at this point
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.560]   as a milestone that Starship or BFR,
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.840]   whatever the name is, was able to achieve?
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.680]   - Well, so far, the milestones we've seen,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.920]   I'd say the first one would be the hop of,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   they call it Starhopper,
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.060]   and it's basically a very rudimentary rocket,
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.280]   but it was the first time they utilized
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.080]   their new Raptor engine to produce
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.360]   thrusted to fly something.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.520]   It first flew literally three meters off the ground
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.000]   or something, tethered to the ground.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.800]   Then it flew 15, and then finally it flew 150 meters.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.040]   And that was in 2019.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.240]   And that was the first big milestone of Starship.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.360]   And then after that, we saw SN5, SN6 do the similar
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.760]   150 meter hops with a little bit more elegant systems,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.800]   proving out more of their tank building,
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   proving out more of their, a lot of just subsystems.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.000]   And then the big ones physically were,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.360]   end of 2020 and early 2021 when they flew
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.640]   the SN8, 9, 10, 11, and 15.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.040]   - What does the N stand for in SN?
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.080]   - I think just serial number or Starship number.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.600]   - Yeah, so SN, these are just names, numbers,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.240]   numerical representations of the different testing efforts.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.600]   They skipped some numbers, right?
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.440]   - Yeah.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.180]   - If they scratch a test.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.560]   - Yeah, and lots of times it'd be like literally
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.360]   that they're building, 'cause at Starbase,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.640]   what SpaceX is working on, like the one foot
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.200]   is always in front of someone else's foot,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.240]   and the arm is not knowing what the leg is doing sometimes.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.080]   - Yeah.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.480]   - They will have someone working on,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.160]   they'll just be like, hurry up and build 40
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.600]   of these tank sections, and you build the bulkhead,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.080]   and you build the downcomer, and you build
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.440]   the header tank, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.000]   And all of a sudden, like, oh, we actually evolved that,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.240]   we don't use that header tank now.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.200]   So it's gonna go onto this one.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.160]   So they'll have parts of certain rockets built,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   and it's like, ah, literally scrap it.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.640]   Not scrap it in the joke term,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.600]   but literally just go scrap it.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.920]   And they, so yeah, they just evolve and iterate so quickly.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   - There were some epic explosions.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.360]   I think Starship, something about it,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.200]   probably just the amount of fuel,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.280]   just leads to some epic, epic failures.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.120]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.680]   - Would you say Starship is the source
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.160]   of the most epic failures in terms of size of explosion?
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.520]   - So you can literally measure it in like a yield
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.560]   of explosive power, you know, like you could TNT.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.880]   Like you can take a look at how much propellant
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.760]   is left over at the time of the explosion.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.480]   And you know, Starship, what's flown so far,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.760]   even though it's physically one
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.960]   of the largest flying objects ever,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.920]   just with the upper stage alone,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.240]   they've not filled it more than like 10 or 20%
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.920]   full of propellant.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.200]   And so it actually hasn't been,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.640]   the failures have been really epic looking,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.120]   big visual fireballs.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.360]   But in terms of space flight,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.320]   they're still pretty small explosions, believe it or not.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.080]   - They could still go bigger.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.800]   - Oh yeah, a lot, a lot.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.840]   - Of course, the test payload of a Tesla Roadster
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.240]   was launched.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.440]   I forget what year that was.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.640]   - Yeah, that was 2018.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.720]   - That was quite epic.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.280]   Would you put that on a milestone?
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.760]   - Oh yeah, yeah, Falcon Heavy demo
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.800]   was like definitely a big, big, big milestone, yeah.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.880]   - Is that funny to you that there's a Roadster
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.720]   floating out there?
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.760]   Do we know the location of that Roadster at this point?
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.160]   - Oh yeah, whereisroadster.com?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.120]   - Yeah? - Oh yeah.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.480]   - Where's, is it orbiting something?
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.000]   - Yeah, it's orbiting the sun.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.080]   So it's orbiting the sun and its orbit is basically
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.000]   between the Earth's orbit and beyond Mars.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.400]   So I think of like 2.5 AU if I remember right.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.560]   So it's beyond Mars' orbit at its highest point
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.960]   and it's back at Earth, kind of at its lowest point.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.000]   - I wonder if there's a mission where you're going to
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.600]   somehow connect with it once again
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.560]   and like place extra things into it.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.080]   I wonder how challenging that is technically.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.120]   - Oh yeah, it could absolutely be done.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.800]   The hard thing at this point,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.620]   because it's on an eccentric orbit,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.440]   would be rendezvousing with it
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.720]   'cause you kind of have to be in alignment with its orbit
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.360]   to really line up well with it.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.080]   But yeah, I mean, someday I don't see any reason
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.360]   why we couldn't at least send for sure an uncrewed,
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.520]   you know, if Elon wanted to just fly a robot out there
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.600]   to check up on it and photograph it or something.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.360]   Like we could, that could be well
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.480]   within the realm of things.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.120]   - Get an Optimus robot up there.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.080]   So that was the story brilliantly told by you
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.040]   of the rockets for SpaceX.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.640]   What about through the lens of engines?
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.600]   Can you give a brief history of the SpaceX rocket engines
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.520]   that were used that we haven't covered?
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.760]   So you mentioned it all started with the Merlin engine
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.800]   and the Kestrel engine.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.040]   What, yeah, through that lens, what's there?
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.000]   - Engines are relatively small number,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.360]   which is easy for us.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.520]   There's the Merlin, and Merlin's evolved throughout time
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.720]   to be from like the Merlin to the Merlin 1C
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.880]   to the Merlin 1D to the Merlin 1D full thrust
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.000]   and all these other kind of tweaks of the same architecture.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.660]   Kestrel ended with Falcon 1.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.080]   They also have the Merlin vacuum engine,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.200]   which is the upper stage engine for Falcon 9.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.960]   Same relative system, but just optimized for vacuum.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.000]   So it has a much larger bell nozzle.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.460]   There's the Draco thrusters,
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.120]   which you kind of can consider engines.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.640]   Well, they are rocket engines, but they're just small.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.560]   They're not like the orbital engines.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.960]   There's the Super Draco engines,
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.360]   which are the abort thrusters on Crew Dragon capsule.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.000]   And then nowadays they have the Raptor engine
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.720]   and the Raptor vacuum variant,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.120]   but they've already had two versions of Raptor.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.720]   We've already seen kind of the Raptor development engine.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.320]   We've kind of seen like a Raptor 1.5,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.440]   where it's kind of taking hints of the future Raptor,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.160]   but now we're well within what you'd consider
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   a Raptor 2 variant.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.400]   And that's really it.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.580]   - Yeah, for the Raptor.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.880]   Maybe I'll ask you that separately,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.600]   but I like in general, and people,
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.580]   who doesn't know who Everyday Astronaut is,
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.160]   but if you don't somehow know,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.760]   go check your YouTube channel out.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.560]   You're an incredible educator about the super technical
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.600]   and the more sort of, even the philosophical,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.880]   the actual space travel.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.440]   So you go down to the raw details of it,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.000]   and there's just great videos on the Raptor engine.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.680]   I think you have one on Merlin,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.880]   and also the actual tours with Elon,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.720]   where he discusses some of those things.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.920]   On one of the tours, he says,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.800]   he's full of good lines, that guy.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.360]   He says something about the number of fiddly bits,
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.000]   and he's, the number of fiddly bits was decreased
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.120]   between Raptor 2 and Raptor 1.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.880]   And I think that's actually a really beautiful representation
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.560]   of the engineering efforts there,
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.320]   which is constantly trying to simplify.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.700]   Increase the efficiency of the engines,
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.700]   but also simplify the design so you can manufacture it.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.960]   And in general, simplification leads to better performance
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.360]   and testing and everything.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.720]   So the number of fiddly bits,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.480]   I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page on that now,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.720]   as an index, is actually a really good one.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.040]   - Well, and when you think about it,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.480]   I don't know of any other company prior
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.360]   that had kind of tried to measure
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   their performance of their engine,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.240]   not in thrust to weight ratio,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.220]   or how efficient it is in specific impulse,
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.440]   but literally in dollar to thrust ratio.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.000]   How much does this engine cost?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.560]   How much thrust can it produce?
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.840]   And using that as a trade study,
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.320]   instead of just pure metrics of,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.400]   'cause at the end of the day,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.740]   okay, if it's cheaper and does X amount of work,
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.840]   even if it's less efficient,
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.360]   it can actually be better long-term.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.240]   - And so I guess another way, it's not even just thrust.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.600]   I don't know if that metric is used,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.440]   but basically the cost of getting one kilogram
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.580]   of thing up into space.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.600]   That's basically what they're trying to minimize.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.620]   - Especially, yeah.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.300]   At the end of the day,
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.680]   that is definitely the ultimate metric,
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   is how much does one kilogram cost to orbit, eventually?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.760]   But it's so funny,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.520]   'cause spaceflight is just the ultimate,
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.880]   it's the ultimate compromise.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.640]   Every little thing,
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.960]   any variable can just change everything else.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.680]   So you can tweak so many different things
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.180]   to get to different numbers and conclusions.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.480]   But even things like on your first stage,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.900]   when the rocket's pointing straight up
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.720]   and the engines are pointing straight down,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.120]   you're dealing more with the thrust to weight ratio
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.960]   of the rocket.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.800]   So how much thrust is it producing
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.480]   versus how much is gravity pulling down on it
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.980]   is actually a more important metric
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.440]   than how raw efficient the engine is.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.280]   So it's funny.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.480]   Then in space, it's kind of the opposite.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.960]   Thrust to weight ratio doesn't really matter.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.680]   What really matters is the actual,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.080]   the specific impulse, let's call it,
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.200]   or the nozzle escape velocity,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.040]   or the injection velocity of how fast is the gas moving.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.560]   It's the more important number on orbit.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.160]   But it's just so crazy,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.000]   'cause there's all these,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.680]   I would just love to see the trade studies,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.000]   when you're trying to figure out,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.560]   is this more important than this, or this, or this?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.320]   And it's like, you change this one little thing,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.760]   and all of a sudden,
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.360]   all the, everything changes.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.320]   It's just, even the profile,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.480]   like the launch profile, the trajectory of it,
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.520]   I mean, everything.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.320]   Everything.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.360]   - I wonder what that trade-out discussions are like,
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.880]   'cause you can't really perfectly plan everything.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   So, and you always have to have some spare leeway,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.240]   especially as you're testing new vehicles, like Starship.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.900]   - Yeah, margins are important.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.120]   - Yeah, having a margin,
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   given all the uncertainty that's there.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.040]   That's really interesting,
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.440]   like how they do those kinds of trade-outs,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.280]   'cause they're also rapidly designing,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.520]   and redesigning, and re-engineering.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.160]   And the, ultimately, you wanna give yourself the freedom
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.560]   to constantly innovate,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.480]   but then, through the process of testing,
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.000]   you solidify the thing that can be relied upon,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.800]   especially if it's a crewed mission.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.320]   - How to do that in a rapid cycle.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.360]   - I remember at some point,
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.780]   that NASA, as they're leading up to flying humans
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.180]   for the first time for NASA,
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.240]   you know, there's some talk that like,
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.880]   we're gonna do a design freeze,
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.040]   because SpaceX does evolve and iterate so quickly.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.400]   You know, they were saying that it was leading,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.680]   'cause especially at the time,
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.880]   it was a mission called Amos 6,
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.160]   and they lost a rocket.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.760]   They've only lost two rockets, like ever, really,
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.520]   as far as, you know, trying to get something to space,
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.720]   for the Falcon 9, sorry.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.620]   And the second one, Amos 6, I mean, that was back in 2016,
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.040]   so it's been a long time.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.640]   But at the time, you know,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.280]   they're looking at flying humans in the near future.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.880]   And it's like, if you guys keep tweaking this thing
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.840]   every time you take it out to the pad,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.440]   well, there's gonna be a problem, you know?
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.240]   And so there is some pressure from NASA
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.800]   to kind of slow down on that iterative process.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.900]   And, but that is also why they were able to evolve
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.200]   the Falcon 9 to be what it is today,
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.840]   is because they did just evolve it so quickly.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.400]   Literally like one after another was never really the same.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.400]   And we're definitely seeing that with Starship now.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.760]   Like it's evolved so quickly
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.000]   that you just can't even keep up with it, you know?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.960]   - So there's a fascinating culture clash there.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.160]   Have you just, in observing and interacting with NASA folks,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.120]   seen them sort of grow and change and evolve themselves,
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.280]   sort of inspired by this new developments
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.620]   in commercial space flight?
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.480]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.800]   There's a lot of, especially like around DM-2,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.960]   there's a lot of talks in the press conferences and stuff
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.160]   where you'd hear people say, you know,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.880]   this was a big, this is well outside of our comfort zone
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.280]   to work with SpaceX in this manner,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.120]   because we take this approach to things,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.280]   we're X, Y, and Z in this way,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.200]   the way we normally certify things.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.560]   And we're not used to SpaceX like,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.200]   well, let's just try it, you know,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.000]   and do something, you know, to a point.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.740]   And so they said it ended up being fantastic.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.120]   They loved working that way because it was just
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.920]   less paperwork almost and more just do.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.680]   And, but at the same time, SpaceX, I think even expressed,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.280]   I don't remember if it was Hans Koenigsmann
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.800]   or someone in a press conference said,
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.920]   well, we really liked having someone just double check us
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.540]   so that we're not doing something super stupid
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.940]   right before we test something, you know.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.400]   So there was a cool collaboration
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.240]   because it is two very different philosophies
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.040]   of development and managing, you know, space programs.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.200]   - I wanted to talk to you a lot about engines
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.440]   and maybe about Starship and maybe about your own
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.520]   becoming an actual astronaut, but like,
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.400]   let's just go there before all that
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.480]   and talk about the actual culture of SpaceX.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.720]   And your conversations with Elon,
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.120]   you've toured SpaceX facilities with him,
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.720]   you've interviewed him, you've interacted with him.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.300]   What have you learned about rockets, about propulsion,
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.840]   about engineering, about design,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.520]   about life from those interactions?
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.840]   He's pretty transparent, open human being as an engineer,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.280]   as a leader, as a person.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   - I would definitely say the biggest takeaway I've had
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.200]   from my times with Elon at SpaceX is,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.720]   like, the idea of questioning your constraints,
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.140]   he says that a lot, but he also does it a lot.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.720]   There'll be times where like,
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.200]   you'll see him change on a dime
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.920]   because he's like rethinking of something
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.240]   in a new or different way.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.560]   And for me, you know,
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.160]   I think we all put constraints on ourselves.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   We think about our own limits, you know,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.240]   on things that we can or cannot do.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.320]   And I think it's made me kind of question,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.960]   like, well, why did I say, no, I can't do that?
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.840]   Or, you know, just off the top of my head.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.800]   A good example.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.240]   So in Iowa, I live in Iowa,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.320]   or half the time or whatever,
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.400]   there's a bike ride across the state of Iowa called Rag Bry.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.880]   And every year you just, you know,
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.240]   like thousands of people get together
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.080]   and they ride across Iowa.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.360]   And it was last summer, I met up with some friends,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.680]   and they're like, hey, do you wanna go on Rag Bry this year?
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.880]   I'm like, it's like a week away.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.240]   They're like, yeah, you wanna go?
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.080]   I'm like, yeah.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.520]   And so I did, you know, without,
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.400]   and it was one of those moments where I was proud of myself,
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.880]   'cause it's like, it's easy to just be like, no,
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.280]   you know, I'm not ready, or this is my constraint.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.180]   It's like, I'm not in shape.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.680]   But like, just question that, you know?
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.280]   And so I think when it comes down
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.600]   to questioning your own constraints,
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.400]   it's yes, even to that level of like,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.120]   why do you question yourself on what you can and cannot do?
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.680]   - So that's for your personal life is really powerful,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.480]   but a little bit more intuitive.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.880]   I think what's really hard is to question constraints
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.280]   in a place like aeronautics or robotics
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.600]   or autonomous vehicles or vehicles,
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.160]   because there's people, there's experts everywhere
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.040]   that have done it for decades.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.080]   And everyone admires those experts
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.280]   and respects those experts.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.840]   And for you to step into a room,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   knowing not much more than just
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.840]   what's in a Wikipedia article,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.080]   and to just use your intuition
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.840]   and first principles thinking to disagree with the experts,
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.280]   that takes some guts, I think.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.240]   - Well, and you can't have everyone doing that either.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.240]   You know, like there has to be some humility
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.680]   of knowing that something is a hardened concept
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.800]   and a hardened, you know, like especially,
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.760]   I'm not an engineer.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.840]   I don't do this stuff, you know?
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.900]   But I can imagine you sitting there
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.200]   having spent six years on a type of valve
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.040]   that perfectly manages cryogenic propellants or whatever,
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.460]   and someone walks in and says,
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.920]   why don't you just put a heater element in there?
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.040]   You know, or something that's, you know,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.640]   something like, because, you know,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.560]   we've done that 40 times or whatever, you know,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.400]   like I'm sure there are things like that
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.200]   that are very frustrating,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.960]   but see, so I don't know what that's like, you know?
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.340]   - The thing is, with the experts,
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.520]   they're always going to be frustrated
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.920]   when the newbie comes in
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.800]   with their first principles thinking,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.100]   but sometimes that frustration is justified,
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.680]   and sometimes it's not.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   Sometimes it's just stubbornness
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.960]   for failing to acknowledge a better way.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.680]   And I've seen it both directions,
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   so which is really interesting.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.280]   So you need both, but that tension's always going to be there
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.560]   and there has to be almost like a dictatorial imperative
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.640]   that breaks through the expertise
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.280]   of the way things have been done in the past
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   to push forward like a new way of doing it.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   And Elon's done that.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.160]   I've seen a lot of great engineers do that.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.600]   I've seen in the machine learning world,
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.540]   because there's been so much development,
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.480]   I've seen that happen.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.680]   Usually when there's like rapid development
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.480]   that starts to come into play.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.520]   And yeah, and I've seen that autonomous vehicle space,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.080]   brain-computer interfaces that Elon has evolved with,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:49.920]   all of it.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.960]   It's kind of fascinating to watch.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.640]   What about the actual design and engineering of the engines?
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.060]   Since you've learned about so many different kinds of engines
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.020]   over the past few years,
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.400]   just like what stands out to you
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.480]   about the way that engineering is done at SpaceX
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.280]   or that Elon does engineering?
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.240]   - The hardest thing to kind of remember
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.800]   is like how much stuff was developed in the '50s and '60s.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.840]   You know, the concepts finally being utilized today
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.680]   were already literally done in the '60s.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.440]   So a lot of the things that SpaceX is doing
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.040]   isn't a novel concept per se.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.840]   Like for instance, the Raptor engine
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.480]   utilizes the full flow stage combustion cycle engine.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.000]   And that was already developed by the Soviets in the '60s
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.880]   for an engine called the RD-270.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.040]   And it makes sense.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.800]   Like on paper, 100% it makes sense
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.200]   because you're basically extracting
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   the absolute maximum potential of the chemical energy
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.000]   in both propellants.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.200]   And at the end of the day,
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.880]   like you have to be dumb enough to say,
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.040]   we're gonna try using this thing
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.880]   'cause it's actually really complicated
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.720]   to do what they're doing.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.560]   But at the same time, so are rockets.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.760]   Like rocket engines are already stupid complicated.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   So adding 10, 20% more pain in the butt during the R&D,
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.120]   if it's in the long, long, long 20, 30 year existence
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.640]   or whatever, like future of that engine,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.480]   is that gonna be worth it?
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.320]   Obviously SpaceX said, yeah,
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.400]   I think we can actually develop this Raptor engine.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.080]   So it's just interesting to see the things
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.560]   that have been looked at, or even reusability.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.640]   You know, like the space shuttle was reusable.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.320]   It was fully, the upper stage, the shuttle itself,
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.000]   the orbiter was, I mean, that thing was,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.280]   for all intents and purposes, a reusable rocket.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.480]   Now, did it live up to its expectations?
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.840]   Not necessarily.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.640]   So it left a lot of bad taste in people's mouth
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.960]   on the ideas of reusability.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.720]   So for SpaceX to kind of come back into the room
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.040]   and on the table and say,
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.400]   we're gonna use a reusable rocket.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.440]   Specifically, we're gonna do a fully reusable rocket.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.160]   You know, a lot of people are, even still today,
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.960]   a lot of people are going,
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.320]   yeah, you're not gonna be able to do that.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.920]   - Even today. - Even today.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.880]   - So like long-term, you're not gonna be able
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.480]   to reuse at scale.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.320]   - Yeah, but definitely, I think the number of people
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.480]   that are saying that today is a small portion
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.720]   of those that were saying that type of thing five years ago.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.200]   You know, when Elon did that announcement in 2016
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.120]   for the ITS, it was very, very aspirational,
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.480]   and people were just like, yeah, right.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.440]   You know, and there was a large number of people
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.640]   that had the factual reasons to think that and do that.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.280]   You know, at the time, they'd only landed
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.840]   like two rockets or something, you know,
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.080]   when they did that, or maybe three.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.800]   It was a very small number.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.080]   When they announced that, actually, they had just lost,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.320]   a couple months prior, they just lost a MO6.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.040]   So they were still this young, blossoming company,
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.000]   and to come in and be like, we've figured out reusability,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.600]   and now we're gonna go full-scale
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.400]   and make the world's biggest, most heaviest,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.560]   most powerful rocket ever,
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.200]   and we're going to fully reuse it,
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.600]   and it's gonna go to Mars, was just pretty out there.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.520]   Like, it really was, and, you know,
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.400]   it's all about perspective, but now, again,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.680]   we're coming up on 100 consecutive landings
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.280]   of an orbital-class rocket that's, you know,
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.320]   45 meters tall, 3.7 meters wide.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.920]   Like, this thing is huge, weighs 20 metric tons,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.440]   even empty, when it's landing.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.880]   That thing's already huge, so seeing the success of that,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.200]   I think people are now more like, well, okay,
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.960]   maybe there is actually the opportunity
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.840]   to be fully reusable.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.040]   That's definitely probably the biggest constraint
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.960]   that I think has been questioned, that is--
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.320]   - The reusability. - Yep.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.440]   - And then, of course, like, the broader one of cost,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.840]   of bringing down costs, that you're able to kind of
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.920]   bring down costs so much,
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.200]   that something like colonizing Mars,
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.640]   or mini-trips to Mars would be a possibility.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.280]   - Yeah. - People don't even,
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.920]   it seems so far out that they don't even have time
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.720]   or give effort to questioning it.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.160]   - Yeah. - But it's the implied
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.840]   questioning, can you really do that many launches?
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.920]   - Actually do it. - Can you actually do it?
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.760]   Yeah. - It's looking,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.800]   I think it's one of those things where you look at the curve.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.560]   You look at like, 10 years ago, that was ridiculous.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.280]   Following this curve, if SpaceX goes from,
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   two years ago launching, I don't remember what it was,
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.520]   40 times to 60 times to 100 times this year,
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.880]   is their amount, and if we just keep extrapolating that out,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.000]   if they, maybe not that exponential,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.360]   maybe it goes more linear or whatever,
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.080]   what's 20, 30 years?
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.840]   The amount of stuff we can put on orbit
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.320]   and the potential we have to do things, absolutely.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.960]   Now I don't wanna put a time frame,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.360]   yeah, I think, but you gotta think,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.040]   we're increasing the number of launches,
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   we're increasing the amount of things in space,
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.100]   we're increasing the amount of payload on orbit.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.360]   That's probably not going to decrease anytime soon,
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.560]   and therefore, eventually, the idea of going to Mars
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.960]   is absolutely reasonable.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.600]   - Let me ask a difficult question
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.120]   that needs to be asked here. (chuckles)
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.960]   Can SpaceX continue its successes without Elon?
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.140]   This long-term mission to Mars.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:00.920]   I think the discussion about Tesla and autopilot
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.960]   or robotics or a neural link with brain-computer interfaces
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.400]   is a question wholly separate from the SpaceX question,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.000]   because there's a lot of other competitors doing
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.120]   some different but amazing engineering that Tesla is doing,
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.880]   in both autonomous vehicles, semi-autonomy or full autonomy,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.640]   and obviously in vehicle design and electric vehicles.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.960]   There's a lot of people that are doing
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.200]   incredible brain-computer interfaces.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.280]   But while there is a lot of competitors to SpaceX,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.480]   and we'll talk about many of them,
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.720]   they're doing amazing work,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.200]   it seems like he's really driving progress here
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.880]   over the past 10 years.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.760]   What do you think about that?
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.320]   - Okay, the first thing I think to remind people
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.840]   is just how many brilliant people do work
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.600]   at each of these companies, obviously.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.840]   Elon's had some of the best teams assembled ever,
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.000]   just incredible people.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:57.840]   He knows this.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.160]   He will gladly tell people, and he says it often,
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.960]   the amazing people, the amazing teams here.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.460]   So it is important to remember that.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.240]   That being said, there is something to Elon's
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.640]   just super far forward,
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.940]   not taking no for an answer on things approach.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.800]   Almost to his dismay, I think,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.200]   he is afraid of the sunk cost fallacy so much
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.160]   that it almost gets to the border of being,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.400]   throw out everything before it's even,
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.120]   we've known it or not, but at the same time,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.720]   it moves the needle so fast, so far.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.440]   So as far as the question of would SpaceX continue
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.800]   to succeeding and be able to ultimately go to Mars
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.240]   without Elon, the Mars thing, I think,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.600]   would probably be hard to uphold without,
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.220]   I think a lot of that drive for Mars is from Elon.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.760]   It is maybe too fantastical for the average person
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.800]   and the average employee and maybe the average CEO
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.720]   that might step in to have a company's mission
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.560]   be to go to Mars.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.220]   - Or even governments, clearly, because like you said,
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.800]   the Mars plan was non-existent for NASA.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.060]   - Yeah, still really, there isn't much.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.960]   So I think if--
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.600]   - How many people, and sorry to interrupt,
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.440]   how many people are talking about it's obvious
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.640]   that we need to become multi-planetary?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.720]   - Right, there's not, there's the Mars Society.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.480]   - Like serious leaders of engineering efforts
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.240]   or nations and so on.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.000]   Which it does seem, if you think about it,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.640]   that it's obvious.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.080]   - Yeah, and the grand eventuality, it is obvious.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.720]   Of human civilization, this whole human experiment
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.160]   we have here, we should be expanding out into the cosmos.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.120]   - 100%.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.240]   So I think the big mission, if we're measuring SpaceX's
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.440]   success on getting to Mars or not,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.240]   I think they'd have a really hard time
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.420]   continuing to fulfill that drive without Elon at the helm.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:00.520]   Now, I think there's a certain balance and beauty of Elon,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.000]   specifically when it was Tesla and SpaceX,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.560]   where Elon will go in, have mild tornadoes
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.640]   around the factory and the engineering,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.200]   and mix everything up, and things get sometimes
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.760]   just totally thrown together.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.360]   And totally just get it done, just to get it done
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.220]   and start moving in that direction.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.840]   And then he'll leave and go do that same thing
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.900]   at SpaceX or Tesla, vice versa.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.340]   And then there's a little bit of a calm
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.240]   where people come back in and they fill in those gaps.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.440]   I think that's always been a pretty healthy thing,
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   honestly, is I think if he is too focused on any one thing,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.820]   it almost is like he'll spin too much.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.120]   - Too many tornadoes.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.600]   - Yeah, too many tornadoes.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.080]   And I think it could almost be,
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.000]   you need someone to come back in and backfill almost.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.080]   'Cause I've heard definitely stories of,
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.880]   probably a good example would be last,
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.800]   last, what was that, last year or two years ago?
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.280]   2022, yeah.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.120]   Was that, yeah.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:50:59.940]   Or no.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.720]   In 2021, they did the first full stack
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.100]   of the Starship Super Heavy.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.740]   And they called it the big surge.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.720]   All of a sudden thousands of SpaceX employees
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.480]   came down to Starbase and they just started building
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.320]   like you wouldn't freaking believe.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.640]   I mean, it's just things going crazy.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.680]   BP, it was actually in the middle,
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.800]   that first interview I did with him
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.400]   was in the middle of that surge.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.320]   There was commotion like you wouldn't believe.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.200]   You couldn't hardly talk
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.880]   because there's just so much going on.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.560]   People just welding and blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.020]   Everything they did during that period was basically scrapped
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.520]   'cause it was just not done very well.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.420]   But they got a fully stacked Starship rocket
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.620]   out on their launch pad.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.640]   I think at some point you kind of have to
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.380]   stabilize some things enough and just say like,
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.340]   this is what we're doing to catalyze some things
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.420]   and say, now do this.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.460]   It's almost like do it for fake, now do it for real almost.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.260]   It's funny 'cause through that time,
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.100]   'cause I had a lot, a lot of conversation with him.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.700]   I think that process was hugely stressful.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.060]   There was a sense, I don't know where that sense is today,
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.940]   but there's a sense that Starship
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.100]   is going to be very hard to pull off.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.500]   - Yeah, that's still--
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.980]   - Borderline impossible to pull off.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.180]   And that was really weighing heavy on him
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.020]   and the team and everybody.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.260]   So to have this chaos of development is fascinating.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.700]   - Yeah, big time.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.260]   And I think they really had to push.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.180]   If they hadn't done that,
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.880]   if they hadn't done that big push,
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.560]   we might only be now seeing a rocket stacked
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.680]   for the first time.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.200]   It might be a lot more finished rocket,
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.840]   a lot more high fidelity,
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.040]   a lot more flight worthy rocket finished and stacked,
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.760]   but, and they might not have to walk stuff backwards,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.240]   but at the same time, like you do have to,
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.480]   in this world, you do have to push really hard
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.560]   to make rapid iteration and rapid change in progress.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.720]   So it's interesting, I don't know.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.400]   - So lingering on that, another question
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.720]   I really should ask you because of,
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   you've seen, you've been in awe of the amazing development
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:11.040]   of space travel technology over the past few years.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.620]   What do you think about Elon buying Twitter?
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.560]   So in this perfect balance,
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.880]   optimized reallocation of tornadoes
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.200]   throughout the various efforts in human civilization,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.320]   do you think, do you worry about his involvement on Twitter?
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.840]   - I mean, personally, I just,
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.480]   I see that as a lot less important than,
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.000]   and personally for me, inspirational than Starship
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.120]   and the work done at SpaceX and Tesla.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.520]   To me, those were two very impactful
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.200]   and really, really just generally like,
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.680]   uniting, like something to rally around,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.120]   get excited about, rally,
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.280]   and just like a future to look forward to.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.320]   The idea of we're gonna be building
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.480]   the world's most powerful, biggest rocket ever,
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.660]   and it's eventually gonna be able to get humans on Mars
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.720]   for the first time.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.060]   And we're gonna transition the world
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.360]   into fully sustainable, awesome,
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.700]   just totally badass cars that do all these cool things.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.320]   To me, those were like, that brought a sense of unity
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.380]   and a sense of like, we can do this.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:17.480]   Personally, I just don't think that a social media,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.200]   no matter what it is, I don't see that in a social media.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.280]   And I don't see any sort of politicking as ever,
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.880]   anything that's really ever a uniting thing.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.560]   - I understand that, I totally agree with you,
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.480]   especially with space, how inspiring it is.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.220]   I have to push back, I do think the impact of social media,
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:42.280]   the basic level of meaningful connections
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.520]   of this collective intelligence
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.000]   that we call human civilization
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.760]   through the medium of digital communication,
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.920]   which is social media, I think that can have a huge impact.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.080]   It could be the very vehicle that increases the inspiration
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.880]   that SpaceX does and all different.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.440]   The thing I've criticized them a bunch for
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.920]   is like, why bring politics into this?
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.560]   So the political divisions that we see on Twitter,
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.280]   feeding them is tricky.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.240]   It's tricky to sort of understand
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.280]   what is the value of that,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.120]   what is the contribution of that
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.700]   to this whole effort we've got going on.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.360]   So that's been a big challenge.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.080]   But that said, again, this tornado,
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.400]   the number of tornadoes in social media,
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.500]   I think is really important,
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:37.320]   because social media has such a huge impact
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.280]   on us as a society.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   And to have a transparent, have a bit of turmoil,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.320]   it's like Tom Waits says,
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.480]   I like my town with a bit of drop of poison,
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.160]   with a little drop of poison.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.080]   So a little bit of that to shake things up,
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.120]   I think might be really healthy.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.760]   I just worry about the long-term impact
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   on the whole Mars project through that.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.700]   But you know what?
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.520]   This life, one of the reasons it's fun
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.680]   is through the chaos,
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.760]   none of us know how it's gonna turn out.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.560]   And hopefully we try to help each other
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.280]   to make sure it turns out well.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.440]   - And this really isn't like anything
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.160]   about my personal politics or anything like that,
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.400]   but really just generally,
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   any of my friends that are like,
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.640]   the first thing you hear about them in their day
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.320]   is something that happened in politics
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.920]   or something that some world leader's doing or not doing
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.820]   or saying and not saying.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.120]   I just don't find that to be the most important thing,
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.220]   really.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.720]   I know that obviously that can affect a lot of people,
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.360]   that has big real-world consequences, politics do.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.740]   Well, I just, and this is just me,
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.920]   I'm such a come-together, cheerio kind of guy,
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.120]   that I just really think you need something bigger
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.480]   than bickering about what people said and did
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.880]   and what they voted on and all this stuff
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.320]   to really push humanity forward.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:08.000]   I know that politics and by extracting that,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.760]   social media can affect things like space flight
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.520]   and even our planetary defense,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.200]   being able to defend ourselves against asteroids.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.760]   If politics has their way and everything goes to crap
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.480]   and we don't even get to,
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.920]   yeah, we're not gonna be able to continue space flight
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.160]   and things like that.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.760]   But I don't know, I just think there's better ways to do it
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.240]   and more uniting ways to do it
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.160]   than what feels like immature name-calling sometimes.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.520]   - Yeah, I think the political bickering
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.760]   that most people talk about
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.280]   that's on top of most people's minds
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.480]   is the thing that'll be completely forgotten by history.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   It has actually very little impact.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.320]   Yes, politics matters, but like 1% of it.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:50.160]   I think most of it is just political bickering,
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.520]   the push and pull of the red team and the blue team
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.040]   and then the news media
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.800]   that feeds off the division for the attention.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.720]   And it's just like a fun athletic event almost
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.480]   with the blue team and the red team.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.600]   So that you kind of have to have
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.160]   a historical perspective on it.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.120]   Most things will not really have a significant impact.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.880]   And we should focus on development of science,
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.240]   technology, engineering,
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.560]   which is the thing that grows the pie.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.760]   - 100%.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.000]   - This is what the economists know well.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.800]   Just the innovation, the engineering,
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.880]   that's what actually makes everybody richer.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.760]   This kind of political bickering is just eating the pie.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.760]   - And not just richer, but it improves their lives.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.680]   We can look at every modern technology
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.680]   that is bestowed upon us today,
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.760]   air conditioning, electricity, internet access,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.040]   fresh, clean water, running water, blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.880]   100 years ago, so many of the things that I listed
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.080]   either didn't exist or were only accessible
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.040]   by the ultra wealthy.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.920]   And it's through the innovation of technology
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.200]   and engineering and education that we're able to have it be
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.080]   that even someone below the poverty line
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.240]   in the most of the developed world
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.840]   will have a good number of those things in their life.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.720]   And that's just continuing to increase
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.400]   and continue to get better.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.600]   So I think, yeah, to me that's in the grand scheme
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.260]   more important, but to each their own.
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.980]   - Speaking of amazing technological development,
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.740]   you have a few videos on this,
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.840]   but how does a rocket engine work?
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:25.320]   You're wearing some of the instruction manuals,
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.680]   but for one type of it, like what's the fuel?
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.800]   What are the types of different rockets
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.160]   that you can kind of give an overview?
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:37.240]   - Yeah, ultimately a rocket engine converts
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.120]   high pressure and heat into kinetic energy.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.560]   Like that's the only real job of a rocket engine
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.480]   is to take a high pressure gas, hot high pressure gas,
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.000]   very energized, there's a lot of energy involved,
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.480]   and then literally turning that into molecules
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.960]   shooting in one direction into kinetic energy.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.040]   So yeah, what you do basically,
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.220]   I mean, the simplest version of it is of course,
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.440]   like famously a balloon.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.160]   You take a balloon, you fill it up with air,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.200]   you've got a pressure, you let go of it,
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.680]   some of the air shoots out in a general direction-ish,
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.520]   you converted that pressure into kinetic energy.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.720]   Now, if you start scaling that up,
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.400]   you can continue to do something like that,
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.560]   like cold gas thruster would be kind of the most simple
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.360]   and easiest rocket engine to make,
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.920]   would be a cold gas thruster.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.040]   And all that is you literally just take air
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.320]   or specifically nitrogen,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.440]   'cause it's a little bit more dense than all the others,
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.400]   or it's the majority of our atmosphere.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.920]   You can, or sorry, it's more sparse.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.000]   You can condense that down,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.880]   sort a really high pressure bottle,
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.320]   and then just literally shoot it through
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.640]   what's called a DeLaval nozzle,
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.720]   which is something that chokes the flow a little bit,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.560]   gets it to be, takes it and gets it into supersonic speeds.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.120]   Once it's at supersonic speed,
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.600]   you actually can't choke it down anymore.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.240]   You'll just constrict the flow of mass flow,
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.120]   you'll constrict the airflow.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.880]   So you actually go opposite, you start making it wider.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.920]   And once it's already at supersonic speeds,
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.600]   if you expand it and make it wider,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.280]   it actually gets faster and faster.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.800]   So at first, when it's subsonic gas,
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.040]   you start shrinking, you constrict the flow,
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.160]   it's actually speeding up, just like a highway.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.360]   If you go from, or any of these examples,
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.600]   like a water hose, if you pinch it down
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.920]   and you wanna flow the same amount of water
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.040]   from point A to point B through a smaller pipe,
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.360]   you can flow more water, the same amount of water
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.960]   from point A to point B with a smaller pipe,
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.720]   it just has to go faster.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.840]   So obviously you can constrict it,
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.960]   but at some point you actually get to a physical limitation
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.360]   and that happens to be the speed of sound.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   Once it gets to the local speed of sound,
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.800]   you can then actually do the opposite.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.200]   You actually expand it back out
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.040]   and you're continuing to convert the pressure
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.200]   into velocity at that point, but it's now supersonic.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.520]   And what's interesting is while you're doing that,
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.120]   you're actually cooling it down too.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.760]   Each bit of that pipe that you're making wider
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.920]   and wider and wider, you're cooling down.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.680]   So the more heat energy you have to work with,
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.080]   the more work you can actually do.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.880]   So at some point, a hot high pressure rocket engine
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.120]   is the best source of,
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.200]   that's the ultimate amount of work you can do.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.160]   - And the nozzle, so as you're saying,
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.840]   there's a bunch of different design options,
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.880]   but it's a critical part of this,
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.440]   how you do that conversion.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.880]   - It's basically like how much can you convert
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.440]   is really the ultimate game.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.880]   How much pressure and heat can we convert into thrust?
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.760]   Really at the end of the day,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.520]   that's what a rocket engine is.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.200]   So you have to have a powerful enough rocket engine
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.720]   to actually lift the rocket and,
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.880]   well, a rocket is mostly just fuel.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.400]   It's like 90 plus percent just the weight of fuel.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.520]   So you just have to lift the fuel
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.360]   that's going to take it into orbit.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.160]   - And that's the thing specifically for rockets,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.080]   you're just saying generally rocket engines,
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.600]   but for the task of going to orbit,
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.120]   you're fighting gravity, Earth gravity,
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.800]   which is fundamentally different than moon gravity
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.400]   or Mars gravity, or like you said,
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.480]   traveling out into space,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   Earth has a pretty intense gravity to overcome.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.760]   - We're lucky, 'cause I think if it was 10% either way,
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.320]   like 10% harder, it'd be like, ugh, we could still do it.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.840]   We'd still, with our current technology,
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.120]   we'd still be able to get stuff into orbit,
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.720]   but man, things like reusability and this commercialization,
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.280]   the success that we've seen in the last 10 years,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.760]   we'd just be on too thin a margins, I think.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.360]   10% easier and we would have been like,
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.960]   I mean, it's just like totally different.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.440]   It's so much easier.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.600]   It's like this big sliding scale
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.960]   and 10% in either direction,
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.320]   we'd be either screwed or really happy,
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.240]   as far as getting into space.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.400]   So it's just hard enough that things like fully reusable
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.600]   becomes very, very, very difficult.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.760]   I think it's completely achievable.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.720]   We have all the pieces to make it achievable.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.440]   It does not disobey any laws of physics.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.080]   It does not disobey any, there's no hard stops.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.680]   It's just very, very, very hard.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.520]   And so ultimately, yeah,
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.600]   on Earth for the first bit of launch,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.440]   again, when the rocket's pointing straight up
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.280]   and the engines are pointing straight down,
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.400]   pointing end up flaming down, you're fighting gravity.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.440]   And so that's kind of your biggest enemy
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.240]   outside of the Earth's atmosphere too.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.480]   - So what kind of sources of fuel is there?
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.640]   So there's chemical rockets, liquid, solid, gas, hybrid.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.480]   There's electric.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.400]   So what are the kinds of fuels we're talking about?
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.240]   What are oxidizers?
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.760]   What, can you just explain your shirt, I guess?
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.040]   (laughing)
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.400]   - Yeah.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.760]   Components of the shirt.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.760]   - So really, I mean, fuels, there's kind of two terms.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.720]   Well, you'll generally hear the word propellant being used.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.040]   It's anything that is used to propel a spacecraft
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.240]   or used in a rocket engine.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.320]   So you have to have, you can have a fuel.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.360]   You have to have a fuel, you have to have an oxidizer,
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.480]   and you have to have a spark
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.640]   to actually get those things burning.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.680]   And that's just a general law of like the universe.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.720]   You have to have fuel, an oxidizer, and a spark.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.040]   Now, some fuels will by themselves spark,
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.080]   like hypergolic fuels, but ultimately you're always left
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.000]   with some kind of fuel oxidizer and a spark.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.280]   So the general ones used most often in rockets,
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.560]   liquid oxygen is kind of the king of,
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.280]   well, there's better oxidizers,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.480]   but they're extremely, extremely hard to work with,
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   like fluorine, but generally liquid oxygen.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.080]   So you just chill oxygen down to its liquid state,
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.920]   minus 183 degrees Celsius.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.320]   So it can be dense enough to store in tanks.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.800]   You know, it's a thousand times more dense
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.240]   when it's in a liquid than it is as a gas.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:31.080]   RP-1, which is basically kerosene, is a very common fuel.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.720]   Another common fuel nowadays is methane, liquid methane.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.800]   Liquid hydrogen is another, it's the most efficient,
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.120]   potential for the most efficient,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.400]   since it's one of the lightest molecules.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.840]   - So I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.040]   but Falcon 9 uses kerosene,
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.360]   and then Starship uses methane, liquid methane?
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.240]   - Yep, for fuel, and they both use liquid oxygen
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.060]   for their oxidizer.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:54.900]   - For their oxidizer, okay.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.380]   - Yep.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.160]   But then, you know, if you get into hypergolics,
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.320]   you'll normally have nitrogen tetroxide,
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.780]   which is your oxidizer,
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.860]   and some form of hydrazine for your fuel.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.660]   There's solid rocket propellants,
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.720]   like solid rocket boosters,
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.160]   and those are actually premixed.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.280]   Your oxidizer is inherently, like, baked,
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.680]   literally, like, kind of baked into the sludge of fuel.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.840]   - So, like, for SpaceX, it's all chemical, liquid fuels.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.680]   - Yep, yep.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.440]   - So how many solid-based fuels are there?
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.760]   Is that, are they still being used today,
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.800]   or is there most rockets?
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.400]   - Yeah, and the United States really is the only ones that,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.640]   well, the only ones, I guess, early on,
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.840]   'cause it was really just the Soviet Union
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.260]   versus the United States.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.160]   The United States started to use solids pretty early on.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.400]   They're simple and easy, but these days, like,
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.160]   you know, you'll still see 'em kind of as,
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.480]   traditionally, like, boosters.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.040]   Like, they're used to just help get something
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.740]   off the ground or help give it a little extra boost.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.760]   So the Space Shuttle famously had those two huge,
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.840]   white solid rocket boosters attached
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.260]   to the orange fuel tank.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.720]   Those are solid rocket propellants.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.600]   Things like the Atlas V can have up to five
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   smaller solid rocket boosters.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.320]   There's very few rockets that use a pure,
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.440]   at least these days, that use a pure solid rocket motor
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.120]   for its first stage.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.560]   There still are, especially in China.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.200]   There's a lot of startup rocket companies
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.080]   that kind of use just missile technology.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.040]   You know, they might use, like,
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.800]   there might just be a variant of an ICBM
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.200]   that just use solid rocket fuel,
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.880]   'cause it is very, relatively easy to develop.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.840]   You know, model rockets use solid rocket motors
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.660]   and stuff like that.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.440]   So they're still around, but they're just not as elegant
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.000]   and not as, yeah, not as used these days, I'd say.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.400]   - So what are rocket engine cycles?
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.040]   Getting, I think, getting more towards your shirt question.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.800]   You have a really good video called,
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.920]   that, I mean, a lot of your videos
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.860]   that are technical are just exceptionally well done.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.860]   So I just, I think you deserve all the props you get.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.940]   I mean, thank you for doing this work.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.320]   Really, really, really, really well done.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.180]   So it's called Rocket Engine Cycles,
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.100]   How Do You Power a Rocket Engine?
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.060]   And you go through all the different options.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.220]   Is there something you could say about open cycle,
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.340]   closed cycle, full flow, all the different variants
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.240]   that you can use words to explain?
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.680]   - Yeah, without all the pretty pictures.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.000]   - Yeah, without the pretty pictures.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   - So ultimately, like we said, your ultimate goal
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.840]   is you want to get heat and pressure into an engine.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.140]   So obviously at some point,
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.980]   you can either make really thick tanks of your rocket.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.840]   You can get it so thick that you store the propellants
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.540]   in really, really high pressures.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:30.560]   But obviously that doesn't scale very well.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.680]   At some point, your rocket's so heavy,
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.200]   you can't even leave the ground,
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.280]   or it's just so much of your mass
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.780]   is just literally the walls of the rocket.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.600]   So at some point, people realize,
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.240]   hey, we could actually just pump the fuels
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.520]   and the oxidizer into the engine at a high pressure
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.160]   and increase the pressure through a pump.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.200]   Now obviously a pump's going to require energy.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.900]   You have to get that energy from somewhere.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:52.680]   And again, at some point people were like,
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.320]   well, rockets are, there's already rocket fuel here.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.660]   We'll just use some of the energy from the rocket fuel
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.160]   to spin these pumps.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.720]   So that would be considered like open cycle,
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.080]   closed cycle, full flow stage combustion cycle
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.260]   are ways to tap into the propellant.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.880]   Actually, and then there's tap off, expander cycle.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   I mean, all of them kind of do the same thing,
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.720]   but you end up at some point spinning a turbine.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.120]   You know, a turbine can take some of the heat energy
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.960]   and the pressure of an engine,
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.100]   and then that can be connected to a shaft to pumps.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.120]   And those pumps can increase the pressure of the propellants
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.160]   and force it into the combustion chamber.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.880]   Now, the difference between open cycle,
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.320]   closed cycle, full flow, all those,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:40.240]   is what happens after the gas has flown through the turbine.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.400]   So after you've used the turbine and spun up the energy,
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.040]   you know, spun up the engine, what happens to that gas?
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.680]   So in an open cycle engine,
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.760]   you basically have like a separate small rocket engine
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.360]   in a sense, it's a gas generator, they call it.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.360]   And that will be used to create some of, you know,
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.540]   take a little, we'll say 10% of your,
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.400]   the propellant flowing to the engine.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.800]   Instead you reroute it to like a smaller rocket engine
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.080]   called the gas generator.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.000]   You point that at your turbine
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.560]   and that will spin your turbine up to, you know,
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.460]   ridiculous speeds, 30,000 plus RPM.
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.120]   And then after it spins, it's wasted most of its energy,
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.700]   you know, and it's just dumped overboard.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.840]   That would be open cycle.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.640]   You're not worrying about it after that point,
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.920]   but you are left with a lot of unburnt, you know,
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.760]   unused fuel, a good amount of that fuel is just completely,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.040]   and especially because the turbine,
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.340]   you have to keep it from melting.
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:34.260]   So you can't run it at like optimal ratios,
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.500]   not necessarily stoichiometric.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.340]   In a rocket engine, you actually don't want it
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.640]   to be near stoichiometric,
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.900]   where you're releasing all the energy.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.780]   You actually wanna release,
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.780]   you actually wanna be throwing out the lighter molecules
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.700]   so it can be shot out faster generally in the engine.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.660]   So, but in order to have a turbine survive,
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.900]   you have to actually cool,
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.180]   you have to have the gas going through it.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.720]   It can't be stupid, stupid hotter
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.300]   or else they're just gonna melt your turbine.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.700]   So they normally, especially in the open cycle,
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.700]   you just run it really fuel rich.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.940]   So there's a lot of extra fuel being pumped into it
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.940]   that will keep the temperatures at a reasonable,
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.460]   you know, at a reasonable temperature.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.460]   So you end up with this like dark sooty smoke
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.420]   pouring out of that gas generator.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:16.100]   That's just unburnt fuel, it's just wasted fuel.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.860]   It never got a chance to be used.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.700]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.700]   - You know, like in the combustion chamber,
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.780]   it's not being used to propel the rocket.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.140]   You know, it's just being used to cool down the propellant
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.780]   that's being used to spin the turbine,
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.340]   that's being used to spin the pumps
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.780]   to push a lot of propellant into the engine.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.180]   So, you know, it doesn't take too long
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.540]   before you're a greedy rocket scientist
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.660]   being like, look at all this wasted propellant,
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.660]   all this potential energy that's just literally
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.700]   being spewed out the side of the rocket.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.100]   So that's where the closed cycle comes in.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.900]   So now we have to get that propellant,
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.900]   take it from basically what was being wasted
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.380]   through the turbine, and you're gonna try
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:52.500]   pumping it back into the engine.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.340]   Now you don't literally just pump that gas
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:00.460]   into the engine, 'cause it's actually way too low
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:04.020]   of pressure compared to the main combustion chamber.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.860]   By that point, by the time it's gone through the turbine,
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.500]   it's lost most of its pressure and heat to the turbine.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.500]   So if you tried pumping it into the engine,
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.900]   you know, just taking that pipe and sticking it
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:13.380]   right into the combustion chamber,
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:15.820]   that much higher pressure, hotter combustion chamber
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.860]   would just go backwards, and it'd stall out the engine,
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.480]   and it'd blow up the engine, and whatever, what have you.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.260]   So what they actually do is they normally will send,
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.860]   there might be some variations of this,
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.380]   but the general concept is you actually flow
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.940]   all of your fuel or all of your oxidizer
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.460]   through the turbine.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.260]   So that would be closed cycle.
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.180]   So there's fuel-rich closed cycle,
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:38.580]   which would be you're flowing all of the fuel
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:42.020]   through the turbine, or there's oxidizer closed cycle,
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.700]   which is where you're flowing all of the oxidizer
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.820]   that's going into the engine through the turbine.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.660]   Now the trick here is you have to have that turbine
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.820]   after it's done its work, so after it's taken
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.760]   some of the potential energy, some of the heat energy
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.740]   from, we're not calling it a pre-burner, by the way,
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.660]   instead of it being a gas generator,
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.260]   you now call that device that's creating pressure
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.180]   to spin the turbine, you're now calling that a pre-burner,
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.940]   'cause it's just going to pre-burn some of your fuel
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.660]   or some of your oxidizer.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.080]   The trick is that has to be, by the time it's gone
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.420]   through the turbine, it has to be higher pressure
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   than the combustion chamber, because otherwise,
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.340]   it's gonna go backwards still.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.060]   So you really have to get that pre-burner
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.220]   up to ridiculously high pressures,
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.940]   like at least 20% higher than your main combustion chamber.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.060]   And these combustion chambers, we're talking about engines
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:32.060]   that are at 200, 100 to 200, even in SpaceX's Raptor engine,
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.980]   up to 300 bar in the main combustion chamber,
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.940]   so that's, what is that, 4,500 PSI, basically.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.260]   Insane amounts of pressure inside these combustion chambers.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.900]   So your turbine has to be even above that,
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.460]   or your gas generator, or your pre-burner, sorry,
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.820]   has to be higher pressure than that even
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.820]   in order to have the flow going the right direction
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.060]   through the engine.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.460]   So now you'll have those closed cycles,
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:57.780]   you'll have fuel-rich, you have oxidizer-rich.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.980]   The tricks now, you start to get, it's crazy,
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.220]   there's just so many compromises.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.940]   Every little decision you have of like, oh, I did this,
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.580]   now I, no, well, now, crap, it's gonna do this.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:10.220]   For instance, fuel-rich, if you ran kerosene fuel-rich,
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.620]   you know how I mentioned soot coming out
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.140]   of the gas generator?
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:18.140]   Well, if you run soot through your engine like that
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.860]   and had to go through your injectors,
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.340]   like back into the engine, it'll clog the pores
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.820]   of the injectors and it'll end up blowing up the engine.
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:28.700]   The soot itself is so damaging that you can't really run
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.540]   a fuel-rich kerosene engine.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.220]   - What exactly is soot?
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.620]   So it's like fuel somehow mixed up with the smoke.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.620]   Like what, I wonder what, what is it chemically?
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.180]   Is it some weird--
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.900]   - It's mostly just carbon.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:42.820]   It's mostly just carbon-- - That dark smoke.
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:46.300]   - Solid chunks of carbon, and it can cake up
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.860]   and just literally like, you know, like--
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.700]   - Yeah.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.260]   - It's like ash almost, you know?
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.380]   Like at some point, you know, especially
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.660]   under those high pressures and high temperatures,
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.740]   it can physically build up and, you know,
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:01.380]   turn into like stalagmites and stalactites of carbon.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:05.900]   Really hard, you know, forged in a rocket engine carbon.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.380]   - I wonder how you figure all that out too.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.420]   Is that some experimentation?
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.740]   Some of that is chem, like theoretical,
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.740]   but like you're gonna have to build the thing at scale
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:14.580]   and actually test it.
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.660]   - And trial and error. - And trial and error.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.980]   - There is-- - Many decades
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.860]   of trial and error.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.180]   - And many pieces of engines that you're trying
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.140]   to piece back together going like,
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.140]   what the hell happened here?
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:23.980]   - Yeah, what happened?
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:24.820]   - Yeah.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.060]   - Okay, so that's closed cycle.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.640]   So how do we get to full flow?
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.180]   - So in either of those situations,
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.940]   you're still actually just having the opposite.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.080]   So if you're fuel rich, you know,
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.020]   all the fuel is going through the turbine,
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.620]   but only a tiny bit of oxygen is actually being put
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.340]   into that pre-burner to spin the pumps.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.100]   And the rest of the oxygen is actually going
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.700]   through the pump, the primary pump,
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.820]   and straight into the combustion chamber.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.420]   Now, full flow, the idea is you're going
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.700]   to actually pre-burn both your propellants.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.220]   Both your propellants are going to go through a pre-burner,
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.660]   and they're both going to end up spinning one of the pumps.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.340]   So you'll have a gas, a fuel rich pre-burner,
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.620]   and you're going to have an oxygen rich pre-burner.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.940]   Each one of those is going to get just, you know,
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.940]   they're gonna heat it up just enough
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.060]   and get it up to just enough pressure
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.220]   to spin up that turbine as fast as they need to do
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.340]   to get the pumps up to the right pressure
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.240]   and still have enough pressure through the turbine
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.060]   to overcome the pressure inside the main combustion chamber.
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.500]   And they're both going to arrive,
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.740]   both your fuel and your oxidizer are going to arrive
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:25.460]   in the main combustion chamber as hot gases already.
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.440]   So what was liquid oxygen is now gaseous oxygen.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.180]   What was liquid methane is now gaseous methane.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.060]   And they're meeting in this combustion chamber
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.480]   at still ridiculously high pressures again.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:41.220]   For SpaceX's Raptor engine, they're meeting at 300 bar.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.300]   Insane amounts of pressure.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.220]   And then they combust from there on,
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.820]   and because they're already a gas-gas interaction,
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.900]   they're happy to burn.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.980]   They're ready to burn, they're ready to mingle
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.780]   as opposed to having a gas-liquid interaction,
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.660]   which is what's a lot more normal.
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:57.620]   You know, you'll have two different states of matter
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.540]   and they just might not,
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.080]   they might take a little more coaxing to,
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:01.920]   what's that word?
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.760]   - Coaxing?
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.140]   - Yeah.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:04.980]   - Coaxing?
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:05.820]   - Coaxing?
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:06.660]   - That doesn't sound like a,
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.900]   that doesn't sound correct, right?
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:08.740]   - Coaxing.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.580]   - Coaxing, yeah.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.820]   - Yeah?
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:11.660]   - All right.
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.480]   - I don't know.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.320]   We'll cut that in post.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.160]   (laughing)
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.260]   - We'll have Morgan Freeman overdub us.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.900]   - Yeah, he's just coaxing.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:23.580]   - The fascinating thing is they're coaxed as gases
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.420]   in the combustion chamber.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   - Why can't I think of that word?
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.320]   But yeah, they just take a little bit more,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.160]   it takes more time in the combustion chamber
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.300]   to have a liquid-gas interaction mixed together
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.780]   and unleash as much of their energy as he can
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.300]   before it exits the system.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.540]   - Some of the trade-offs here in terms of efficiency,
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.300]   which is most efficient,
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.420]   and then also complexity of the design and the engineering,
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.380]   and the cost of the design and the engineering.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:47.540]   Like what are the different trade-offs
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.140]   between open cycle, closed cycle, and full flow?
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.300]   - Yeah, it's a pretty, it's kind of like a,
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.340]   what's the bears, the Goldilocks, you know?
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:59.180]   Like it's like, you kind of generally,
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.900]   the easiest is open cycle.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.500]   'Cause you know, you're just expelling the exhaust gas,
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.420]   the gas-generated exhaust.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.260]   You're not having to worry about it.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:08.740]   You just spin up that thing as much as you need
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.980]   and deal with it, right?
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.460]   No big deal.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:15.060]   Closed cycles offers 10 to 15% greater performance
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:18.540]   generally because you're not wasting that propellant.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.380]   And, but it's complicated.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.220]   It's a lot more complicated,
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.460]   especially if you're doing oxygen-rich.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.020]   Now you're having hot, gaseous oxygen in your engine,
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.420]   which just generally wants to react with everything.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.140]   It's just a recipe, like hot oxygen is just a recipe
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.580]   for things to catch on fire that shouldn't be on fire.
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:39.620]   So metals, you know, under those conditions,
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.660]   lots of times will just spontaneously start burning.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.260]   You know, you'll actually turn your metal
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.860]   and it will now become fuel.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.540]   You'll be engine-rich before you know it
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.340]   because your hot oxygen is eating
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.900]   and using that engine as fuel, basically.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.260]   So oxygen-rich is generally very hard,
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.180]   but that is what the Soviet Union ended up doing
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.140]   with almost their entire line of engines
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.700]   was closed cycle oxygen-rich.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.460]   But you know, so those two are kind of generally hard,
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.740]   but offer great performance benefits over open cycle.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.620]   But at the end of the day, you know,
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.100]   full flow is by far the ultimate of all of them.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.740]   It's the most difficult,
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.700]   but it also has the most potential to be the most efficient.
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.340]   - Starship, the Raptor 2,
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.100]   why is that engine using full flow?
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.860]   - Because it's the best.
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.760]   I mean, it's just physics-wise,
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.460]   if you're trying to extract as much energy
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.420]   out of your propellants,
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.580]   there just isn't another cycle type that is better than it.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.980]   But of course, it's very, very hard to develop.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:38.340]   You know, so far to date, the RD-270 in the '60s was built.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.500]   There is a powerhead demonstrator built in the United States
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.820]   in the '90s and early 2000s, I think,
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.180]   maybe just the early 2000s.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.820]   That was just the power,
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:49.700]   just the pumps and the turbines and the pre-burners,
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.220]   no chamber, no nothing.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.380]   That was a big deal.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.700]   Only the United States took, you know,
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.860]   millions of dollars to just develop that.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.660]   And then there's SpaceX's Raptor engine.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.660]   - So you talked about the combustion chamber
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.260]   and how damn hot things get.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:05.980]   High pressure, a lot of heat.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.220]   How do you keep the thing cool?
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.460]   You have a great video on this too.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:13.380]   How do you get it from, what do you call it,
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.860]   metal-rich, engine-rich,
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.580]   engine-rich from like the metal from melting?
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.940]   - Well, one of the ways is to let it be engine-rich.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.740]   There's actually, you can use ablative cooling.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.980]   You can literally make the walls thicker
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:27.820]   than you normally make it,
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.480]   make it out of a material that will ablate away,
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.380]   that will kind of chip away
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.140]   and take some of the heat away with it.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.700]   It's very, again, primitive.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.540]   And it's actually what SpaceX first used
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.140]   on their first Merlin engines.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.220]   They used ablative cooling.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.980]   So it's basically a carbon nozzle
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:42.820]   and you just let it get,
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.900]   the inner layer of the engine was carbon
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.820]   and you just let it get chewed away and eaten away.
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.580]   And that's just something you factor in.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.460]   It's not very elegant
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.300]   and it's definitely not reusable in that sense.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.460]   - So there's probably really good models
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.420]   about how it melts away,
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.700]   the rate at which it melts away to know what thickness.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:05.540]   - Yeah.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:06.540]   - But boy, is it dangerous.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:09.860]   - I just mean, it seems so silly.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.580]   So obviously you probably,
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:13.700]   again, it's not the most elegant.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.540]   And the problem too,
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.420]   your geometry physically is changing too
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.260]   'cause as you're eroding the walls,
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.980]   now things like your expansion ratio
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.300]   or the ratio between your throat
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.260]   and the nozzle exit is changing
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.380]   because the thickness,
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.020]   like the throat's diameter is actually,
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.000]   like everything's changing.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.940]   So it's not great.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.300]   - It might not be melting away uniformly.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:33.620]   There could be some like weird pockets for aerodynamics
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.740]   that there's just a bunch of chaos
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:36.580]   just can--
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:39.060]   - I can't imagine having to like
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.620]   figure all that stuff out, honestly.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:41.980]   - Yeah.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.620]   - So the more elegant thing to do,
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:46.160]   there's a couple other things you can do,
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.540]   but kind of the most common one,
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.940]   especially when we're dealing with liquid-fueled rockets
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:52.180]   is something called regeneratively cooling.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.820]   And the idea is you basically just flow fuel
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.380]   or fuel or oxidizer through the walls
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.220]   of the nozzle and the chamber
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.820]   before they go through,
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.860]   like into the injector
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:05.300]   or into the actual combustion chamber.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.620]   By doing that, you're taking heat out of the,
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:11.260]   you know, you're taking heat out of the metal of the walls
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.500]   and you're putting it into the propellant.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.220]   So you're typically heating the propellant up,
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.540]   which is, remember when I said there's gas interaction
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.540]   versus a liquid, like liquid gas,
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.980]   lots of times, even if you pump them both at,
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.220]   you know, as they, you know,
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.020]   are both being pumped as liquids,
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.700]   by the time it goes through the walls of the chamber,
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.460]   lots of times one of them is phase-changed into a gas.
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.140]   So now you do have that gas-liquid interaction.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.480]   That's because they're using that,
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.220]   the fuel or the oxidizer to cool the walls of the engine.
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.260]   So when you look at a rocket engine,
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.280]   although it looks like, you know,
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.380]   a nice, beautifully uniform cylinder,
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.180]   you know, smooth thing,
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.780]   there's either, there's oftentimes like channels
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.900]   actually like milled into the walls
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.780]   that they run fuel through.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.780]   And even though they're tight, you know,
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.020]   they can be like two, three millimeters thick,
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.100]   they'll actually still have a channel
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.180]   that goes down and U-turns and comes around and comes back
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:00.200]   all the way down to the tip of the nozzle and everything.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.180]   So it's just insane that, you know, that--
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.120]   - Isn't that pre-designed and that's like,
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.560]   so they design those channels.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.400]   - Yeah.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.160]   - There's probably some optimization there,
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.640]   like how the flow happens.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.880]   - Well, especially 'cause you're thinking
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.440]   about a conical thing or like a semi-conical thing
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.320]   where the area's getting smaller and smaller and smaller,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.240]   you're flowing the same amount of propellant through it
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.440]   as you are down, you know what I mean?
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:23.880]   Like the propellant has to,
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.440]   so they have all these unique things like, you know,
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.440]   sometimes different manifolds where they'll inject more
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.400]   or less fuel in certain areas and--
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.600]   - There must be like propellant simulation software
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.800]   'cause they can't, surely can't like test this
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.960]   on actual physical--
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.080]   - Well, back in the day, they had to just build it.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.880]   - Well, you mean back in the day,
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.240]   walked uphill in both ways.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.080]   (Luke laughs)
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.800]   It was like, I mean, like anything back in the day
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   before computers where you like had--
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.600]   - Like, you just had to do it.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.600]   - And like your simulation or modeling
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.680]   was like a sheet of paper where you're like calculating
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.160]   stuff, loosely estimating.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.240]   - Heat flux, you know, like you can literally see
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.480]   how much energy and how much heat is inside
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.640]   the combustion chamber, how much, you know,
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.200]   and that is a measurable thing even without a computer.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.800]   Now, I'm not near smart enough to do any of this.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.840]   Like I've never tried measuring the heat flux of anything.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.920]   I barely even know what that means.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.760]   I'm just smart enough to regurgitate it.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.840]   - You haven't lived, my friend.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.080]   And you haven't lived.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.920]   - But that is something that people would calculate
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.720]   and they find out, okay, copper, you know,
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.160]   does a better job of transferring the heat
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.760]   between the walls of it and into the propellant,
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.920]   blah, blah, blah, blah, compared to XYZ.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.440]   So, you know--
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.800]   - Yeah, materials, people.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.080]   Like I've met just in all walks of life,
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.960]   especially just through MIT, through everywhere,
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   where some people are just like 100x smarter
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.840]   than anyone you've ever met at a particular thing.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.840]   Like you mentioned copper.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.360]   They'll know the heat dissipation
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   through different materials.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.480]   They'll understand that like more than,
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.320]   it's like holy shit, it's possible for a human being
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.000]   to deeply understand a thing.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.240]   - Dude, aerospace is full of that.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:11.680]   You'll have people that are so niche in something
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.560]   that no, like the average person
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.120]   has never even remotely thought of,
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.240]   yet this person has done it 40,000 different ways
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.800]   in an environment being like, well,
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.560]   we found out that if we turn it four degrees that way
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.720]   and add 4% niobium, you know,
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.520]   like just things you're like, what is your life
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.360]   and how do you know this, you know?
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.040]   - And the funny thing about them,
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.920]   they usually don't think it's a big deal.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.840]   - They're usually like, they're so nonchalant about it
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.040]   that if you don't actually, you have to know enough.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.400]   You actually have to know quite a lot
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.840]   to appreciate how much more they know.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.680]   - Yeah.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.920]   - 'Cause otherwise you won't even notice it.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.800]   'Cause our popular culture doesn't celebrate
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.480]   the intricacies of scientific or engineering mastery,
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.320]   which is interesting.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.480]   There's all these people that lurk in the shadows.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.320]   - Oh, I know.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.140]   - They're just geniuses.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:01.980]   - Yes.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.720]   - Like you see, you'll have like the LeBrons
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.800]   who are like good at basketball,
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.920]   so we understand that they're good at basketball.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.800]   They do this thing with the ball and the hoop
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.360]   and they do like it really well,
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.320]   better than a lot of other people under pressure.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.160]   Like we celebrate and give them--
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.720]   - It's a big public spectacle.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.560]   - Yeah.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.380]   - Look how great they are, yeah.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.600]   - But like the people like, yeah,
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.960]   these aerospace companies and NASA, SpaceX,
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.220]   the kind of stuff they're doing,
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.880]   just the, I mean, there's geniuses there.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   And it's actually really inspiring.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.360]   I mean, I've interacted with a lot of brilliant people
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.560]   in the software world.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.760]   And maybe because I don't deeply understand
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.440]   a lot of hardware stuff, materials engineering,
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.840]   mechanical engineering,
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.400]   those people seem like so much smarter.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.960]   I mean, it's always like the grass is green
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.520]   or whatever the expression is.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.560]   But there's a depth of understanding
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.080]   that engineers have that do like mechanical engineering
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.280]   that's just awe-inspiring to me.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.520]   - Not to get too like,
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.080]   I don't know what the word would be,
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.460]   introvertive or something or whatever,
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.840]   but that's actually kind of the whole point
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.240]   of Everyday Astronaut.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.380]   Like that's almost the whole point of what I do.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.120]   Each year from the beginning,
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.180]   I did a thing called the Astro Awards,
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.240]   trying to be like an award show,
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.740]   hoping to lift up and celebrate and shine a spotlight
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.600]   on the people that are actually doing the hard work
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.960]   and try to treat them like the rock stars that they are,
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.480]   that we don't know about.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.960]   And I think that's one of the things that for sure,
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.640]   I think Elon definitely helped make space flight cool,
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.000]   helped make that like a celebration thing
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.040]   where people are physically out cheering for rockets
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.700]   and science and space exploration.
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:34.960]   But I think that's just the beginning.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.680]   I think like this should be a thing
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:40.120]   where the general public looks to these people
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.040]   as the coolest ones, as the coolest places to work,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   as the most important things.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.000]   Sports are great and everything.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.920]   I'm a big Formula One fan and things like that.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.040]   But at the same time,
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.840]   like we should be celebrating the people
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.000]   doing this crazy work, clocking in countless hours,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.400]   just trying to figure out this one little thing
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.300]   that's gonna help us further our understanding.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.360]   - I mean, what's cooler than a giant thing
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.000]   with a really hot fire that goes boom
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.480]   and goes up into the air.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   I mean, like there's no, it's like,
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.120]   to me like bridges are inspiring.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.600]   It's like incredible architecture design
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.200]   and like the humans are able to work against nature,
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.920]   build these gigantic metal things,
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.160]   but like rockets with like a tiny little humans
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.600]   on top of them flying out into space.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.320]   It's the coolest possible thing.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.280]   Everything comes together.
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.300]   All the different disciplines come together
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:38.640]   for the high stakes drama of riding
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.800]   that super powerful thing up away
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.520]   from the thing we call home, Earth.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.920]   It's like, it's so amazing.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.360]   - Exactly. - So freaking amazing.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.960]   - Well, I think that's kind of part of my story arc
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.000]   is I just used to be a huge car and motorcycle guy.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.880]   Like I just loved things that go fast
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.920]   and are loud and go fast and make lots of power.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.680]   And at the end of the day, like at some point you realize
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.120]   nothing goes faster and it's louder
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.760]   and makes more power than a rocket.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.600]   I think that's kind of where I eventually just ended up,
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.320]   wound up there just because there is nothing cooler than that
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.560]   - Yeah, that's the ultimate level of reach as a car guy
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.800]   is to become a rocket guy.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.240]   - Yeah, a hundred percent.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.520]   And at some point, some car guys literally become rocket guys
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.560]   and strap rockets to cars
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.000]   and try and break land speed records.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.520]   You know, like it's the same universe here.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.640]   - So Elon, with your conversation with him on the Raptor 2,
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.200]   was talking about, you were talking about
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.640]   like there's an excessive amount of cooling
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.160]   to be on the safe side as you're developing the engine.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.520]   What kind of cooling was that?
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.000]   - So that would be film cooling.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.120]   So remember how a little bit ago we were talking about
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.800]   like keeping the turbine from melting,
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.640]   you can just run it off of like off nominal, basically off,
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.200]   you know, typically fuel rich,
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.600]   just run more fuel through that.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.920]   So it's cool enough.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.240]   You can actually do that locally kind of in your engine
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.200]   so that you can keep it.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.880]   So, you know, imagine a combustion chamber
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.400]   and the top of it's just a flat, like imagine a shower head.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.480]   And then you have like, you know,
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.440]   the combustion chamber attached to it.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.800]   The outer perimeter there,
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.280]   the part where the flame front would be touching the walls,
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.880]   you can actually have just more fuel injectors.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.880]   So you're injecting locally a more fuel rich zone
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.880]   along the entire nozzle.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.640]   And that would be called film cooling.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.400]   So it's less efficient though.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.880]   Again, you're kind of wasting fuel.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.760]   There's fuel that's running, you know,
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.080]   and your mixture ratio is off,
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.840]   but only for a little portion of your, the big picture,
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.560]   you know, so that's one of those compromises.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.920]   Like you can do additional film cooling
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.480]   to make sure you're not melting your engine, you know,
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.600]   but at the cost of performance usually.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.600]   But you can also be smart and use film cooling.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.960]   You know, there's fun little clever tricks.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.960]   For instance, you'll notice on the F1 engine
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.960]   that was on the Saturn V, you know,
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:51.080]   the biggest rocket that had been built to date
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.680]   prior now to Starship,
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:56.720]   the F1 has this huge, huge, huge engines.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.000]   There's five of them on the Saturn V.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.320]   And you'll notice that like the gas generator
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   has a pipe that comes down
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.400]   and then it actually splits off in a manifold
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.240]   and wraps around part of the nozzle.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   And that manifold takes the hot gas from the turbine,
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.600]   which is actually, I mean, it's not hot.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.160]   It's actually cold gas compared to the combustion chamber,
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.560]   but it's, you know, in human terms,
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.160]   it's still, you wouldn't want to put your hand in it,
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.320]   you know, not live.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.920]   And it actually pipes that gas into the nozzle
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:30.040]   so that it creates a film cooling,
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.560]   an actual boundary layer of cooler gas
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.920]   against the hotter combustion chamber gas.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.280]   So basically repurposing that gas that was normally wasted
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.280]   and they pump it back into the engine
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.960]   and then into the nozzle, like kind of further down.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:46.800]   So the trick there is it has to be far enough down
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.960]   that the pressure in the nozzle,
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.160]   because remember as the nozzle gets bigger
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.000]   and bigger and bigger,
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.320]   the pressure's getting lower and lower
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.840]   and the temperature's getting lower and lower.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.320]   So you have to find this trade-off point
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:00.320]   where the pressure is lower than that gas from the turbine
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.600]   and then you pump it in and it's cooler
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:06.040]   than the gas still is in the nozzle
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.880]   and it can help not melt your nozzle.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.160]   So you'll notice that the F1 is actually a good example
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.080]   of regen cooling.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.560]   So the chamber walls,
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.560]   you can physically see the pipes actually on the F1
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.760]   'cause it's so big and they just literally used pipes
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.800]   and bent them and you can see the coolant channels
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.120]   all the way up and down the engine
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.000]   until you get to that manifold.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   Then from there on,
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.080]   it just has what's called a nozzle extension
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.240]   and it keeps going and going and going
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.960]   and that section of nozzle is cooled
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:34.040]   by the film cooling of the gas generator.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.920]   - They mean the aerodynamics of cooler gas
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.480]   and the hot gas,
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.480]   'cause you have to have this kind of layer, right?
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.360]   To protect the layer of cool,
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.360]   like understanding that obviously probably has to do,
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.240]   in modern times,
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.840]   there's probably really good simulation of aerodynamics.
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:54.360]   But, and to do it in terms of pressure too,
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.760]   like to make sure it's in the right place
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.240]   that doesn't go back up.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.240]   - Go backwards, exactly.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.600]   If they have that manifold even six inches too high
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.520]   on that nozzle, yeah, it's just gonna go upwards.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.120]   Pressure always wants to flow from high to low.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.000]   - The number of options you have here
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.400]   that result in it going boom is very large.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.800]   - Near infinity, yeah.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.720]   - Especially 'cause, I mean,
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.120]   you can't do like a small model of it.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.960]   Maybe you can, no, you can't.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.320]   - It doesn't really scale very well.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.680]   - No, you have to do the full testing
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.680]   and that's why you have all the kind of,
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:31.760]   that's why you have with Starship all the tests that,
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.440]   you know, you think,
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.960]   why would you need to do so many static fires
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:36.800]   and so many tests?
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.240]   Why is it failing so many times?
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.680]   Can't you get it right?
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.880]   But like, it's very tough to get it right.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.200]   - Well, and when you're pushing the boundaries,
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.800]   you want to know where and how it's going to fail.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:47.640]   - That's right.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.480]   - So you can engineer around them.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.000]   So that's a luxury that SpaceX does have
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   with the scale of Raptor.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.160]   You know, they're building Raptor cheaper
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.040]   than probably almost any other engine,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.400]   you know, maybe besides some of their own,
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.240]   at least at that scale.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.760]   Then before they're testing, you know,
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.160]   I think since last March or last April,
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.360]   they've tested a thousand Raptor,
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.600]   you know, a thousand engine fires, I guess,
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.680]   not just Raptors, but, you know,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.960]   that's just an insane amount of data
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.800]   and an insane amount of edge cases to learn,
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.640]   oh my God, we found out that we were actually
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   slightly over spinning our turbine at this degree
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.640]   and this frequency is harmonic at this blah, blah, blah,
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.400]   and all of a sudden realize it's rattling and, you know,
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.600]   it did this and then you can engineer around that.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.760]   You know, it's like, ultimately, you know,
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.640]   I think Elon said something like,
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:33.480]   high production rate solves many ills
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.080]   or something along those lines.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.640]   And it's just true, if you have an insane amount of engines
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.880]   and an insane amount of data
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.660]   and an insane amount of failures to learn from,
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.360]   you just know your system inside and out,
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.520]   you know those margins,
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.320]   you know where the failure points are,
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.320]   you know how to engineer around them.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.800]   - That's how I approach dating.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.640]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.520]   (laughing)
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.700]   'Cause we're talking about engines.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:57.420]   So most rockets, I think all rockets
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:00.000]   have multiple stages today.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.300]   Maybe they'll take us in a discussion
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:03.640]   of what ideas that could be for single stage
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.360]   to orbit rockets, but can you describe this whole thing
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.600]   that you've been mentioning here and there
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.060]   of multiple stages of a rocket?
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.200]   - Yeah, no, that's a good question.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.920]   So ultimately, you know, like I said,
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.960]   you're kind of pushing about 90%.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.360]   The rocket's like basically just fuel with some skin on it,
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.880]   you know what I mean?
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.960]   And so that skin weighs a lot of,
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.720]   you know, skin in the engines do weigh a lot.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.360]   You know, like I said, the Falcon 9 on its own
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.380]   is about 20 tons, just the booster is about 20 metric tons.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.880]   So it's not an insignificant amount of weight.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.200]   So the idea is, with staging,
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.880]   is you ditch anything you don't need, more or less.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.100]   So, you know, Falcon 9's a perfect rocket
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:44.920]   to think about this because you have an upper stage
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.320]   and you have a booster, you know, our first stage.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.960]   And the first stage burns through all of its fuel.
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.240]   Once it's out of fuel, you let go of the second stage
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.480]   and ta-da, you actually just basically started
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.360]   and lit a brand new, fresh rocket.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.760]   You know, and this brand new, fresh rocket
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.800]   now doesn't have all that 20 tons attached to it.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.700]   So it's a lot lighter.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.080]   It doesn't need, you know, as nearly as many engines
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:05.920]   to push it around.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.860]   It needs just one instead of nine.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:11.300]   Its engine can be optimized for the vacuum of space
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.560]   as opposed to having to operate at sea level
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.320]   with all of our, actually pretty thick atmosphere,
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.720]   you know, relatively.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.360]   So staging is basically the idea
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.320]   that you get rid of things you don't need.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.160]   On Earth, again, kind of that whole like 10%,
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.620]   harder, 10% easier.
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.600]   If it was 10% easier, single stage orbit
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.640]   would be no big deal.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.360]   And it probably would have been like the way
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.720]   to get to orbit by choice,
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.360]   just because like, it's not that hard.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.360]   But with our Earth as it is, with physics as it is,
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.960]   it's just, it's doable.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.920]   And we've had, and you know, we almost kind of,
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.040]   actually the first orbit to take humans,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.040]   or the first rocket to take humans into orbit
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   from the United States, which was the Atlas rocket,
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.680]   was kind of a stage and a half.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.120]   It actually only had like one big fuel tank.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.600]   And what that is, they actually dropped off
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.320]   two of its three engines.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.760]   So it just ditched some of the engines.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.020]   But if it hadn't done that, you know,
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.160]   so kind of people were like, well, that was single stage.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.600]   It's like, it still had a staging event.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.760]   It still had to ditch mass
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:12.920]   in order to even make it into orbit.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.240]   Had it not done that,
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.480]   it would have not been able to get into orbit.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.000]   So you pretty quickly look at your trade and say,
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.160]   okay, well, if I wanna stick to single stage for orbit,
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.720]   my payload mass becomes tiny.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.840]   You know, like you might be able to put like,
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.560]   you know, a Falcon 9 booster on its own.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.440]   Like if you just flew one of the side core boosters
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.120]   of a Falcon Heavy with a nose cone on and everything,
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.560]   just say, I'm just gonna fly this on its own.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.200]   You might be able to put like, you know,
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.320]   10 kilograms into space or something, you know,
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.840]   a very small amount.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.200]   Well, throw a second stage on that thing
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.320]   and now you can put, you know,
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.200]   17,000 kilograms into space.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.720]   So it's just an order, you know,
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.960]   orders of magnitude more payload capacity
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.960]   because you did staging,
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.880]   because you ditched the residual weight.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:01.880]   So the other thing that's hard about that too
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.040]   is that the engines, again, that operate at sea level
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.760]   are often not great in space and vice versa.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.920]   Like you physically can't,
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.920]   most optimized for space engines,
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.720]   you can't even operate at sea level.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.160]   They'll destroy themselves
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.240]   due to something called flow separation.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.800]   So not only are you getting the benefit
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.760]   of ditching all the weight,
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.080]   but you're also able to use a much more efficient
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.360]   and less, typically, you know,
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.200]   much less powerful engine in space.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.640]   - So you mentioned on the multistage rockets
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.280]   that maybe the dream would be,
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.000]   if we weren't living on Earth,
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]   but maybe we can on Earth,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.680]   to have a single stage to orbit rocket
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.640]   where it's all one package reusable.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.960]   - Reusable gets even harder.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.880]   - It gets even harder.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.120]   So first of all, what is, just to linger on it,
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.920]   what is the single stage to orbit rocket?
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.440]   And why is it so hard to achieve on Earth?
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.480]   You already kind of explained it a little bit,
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.240]   but just, if we were to say like,
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.880]   that's your assignment.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.720]   - Yeah.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.800]   - Tim, you're supposed to get together with Elon
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.600]   and other brilliant people,
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.320]   and like, you have to do this.
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.400]   - Yeah.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.680]   - Why is it so hard?
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.920]   - Why is it so hard?
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:19.280]   The payload fraction of a rocket is like three to five
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:22.040]   or six or 7% would be like, you know,
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.480]   that's the amount of payload
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.880]   compared to the total mass of the rocket.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.480]   Like, you're lucky to get into beyond 5%.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.600]   So if you're now having to deal with the weight
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.520]   of the rocket by the time you're in orbit,
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:34.320]   like, your payload fraction,
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.960]   you're talking about like margins,
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.640]   that's such, it's so small amount of leftover
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.880]   if you had to take all of it with you.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.880]   So the sooner you can ditch weight, the better.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.120]   The sooner you can ditch weight, the better.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.240]   The sooner you can, you know,
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.120]   and that's what you're doing,
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.760]   a rocket the whole time is actually ditching weight.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.680]   All of that fuel, all that big giant flame you see
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.560]   is literally mass being thrown out the back of the rocket.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.320]   But what typically isn't expended, you know,
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.280]   at least during nominal operations,
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.960]   you're not seeing the engines being, you know,
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.760]   expelled out the thing until you get to staging, of course.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.760]   And that's where, you know,
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.360]   you're ditching all that dead weight.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.240]   So single stage to orbit,
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:14.000]   your margins just become so small that it's border,
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.480]   it's not impossible, but it's just,
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.280]   at the end of the day, like almost no matter who you are,
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.320]   you end up saying it's just simply not worth it.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.560]   Like, it'd be, if you have two rockets
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.560]   that are using the same amount of propellant,
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.080]   you know, they're the same physical sizes,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.880]   and one of them is cutting, you know,
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:30.080]   on a third and has another little engine,
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.080]   it'll have a hundred or a thousand times
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.360]   more payload capacity
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.400]   than the one sitting right next to it.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.000]   And now, so there's tricks you can do
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.240]   to like try to offset that,
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.760]   things like aerospike engines,
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.760]   which operate as efficiently at sea level,
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.240]   at kind of optimized efficiency at sea level.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.560]   And just by their, by the way,
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.840]   their design, the physics of them,
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.060]   they're also efficient in a vacuum too.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:55.200]   You can do things like that.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.720]   And at the end of the day, though,
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.500]   you just end up with a worse rocket
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.920]   than if you had just done stage,
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.760]   like no matter what.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.600]   And people say like,
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.160]   "Well, what if you develop the new technologies?"
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.500]   Like, okay, apply that technology
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.780]   to a multi-stage rocket,
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:07.880]   and it's gonna do better, you know,
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.920]   like no matter where you end up,
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.000]   it's just always better to ditch that weight, you know?
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.520]   - Is there a cost to having multi-stage?
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.760]   'Cause you can still reuse the different stages?
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.280]   - That's the dream is, you know,
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.080]   it becomes easier to reuse multiple stages
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:21.920]   because now, you know,
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:24.000]   like the booster doesn't have to survive
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.920]   orbital re-entry temperatures and extreme environments.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.320]   And you only have to, you know,
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.720]   make survivable the upper stage.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.960]   So you only have to put a big heat shield.
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.720]   I mean, Starship's the perfect thing in this.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.640]   The upper stage has a big giant heat shield.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.600]   The booster doesn't need it
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.400]   'cause the booster's not going to orbit.
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.880]   It's only going a fifth or a quarter of orbital velocity.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.760]   So it's heat that it experiences is survivable
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.820]   just by the stainless steel.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.060]   You don't need an additional heat shield.
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:52.040]   So all of a sudden, if you're trying to reuse,
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.280]   pretend that you just welded
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.560]   the two stages of Starship together,
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.400]   remove those engines on Starship.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.880]   That whole vehicle, if you're trying to reuse it,
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.760]   the whole vehicle now has to have
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.440]   a heat shield on one side of it.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.960]   The whole thing has to have these big, heavy wings.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.800]   By the time you come down to it,
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:07.560]   there's probably just zero payload capacity.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.680]   You basically put your fuel tank in space, you know?
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.520]   Good job.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.600]   - So the dream of a single stage to orbit a rocket,
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:18.960]   is that just even the wrong dream on Earth?
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.520]   - That's what most convention tells you.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.280]   You know, by the time, if your goal is cheap,
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.800]   then you're going to spend,
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.640]   you're going to have a physically larger rocket
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.480]   that has more engines, that has more propellant,
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.440]   blah, blah, blah, to put the same amount of mass into orbit
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.320]   compared to something else.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.400]   You know, we're talking like Rocket Lab's Electron,
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.920]   a really small rocket.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.280]   It's like, I think 1.3 meters wide
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.800]   and something like, you know, 18 meters tall or something.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.040]   It's a small rocket.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.680]   If you were to, you know,
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.820]   and it can put something like 300 or so kilograms into orbit.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:54.520]   You could either launch something that size,
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.120]   or again, like a full, like big old Falcon 9 booster,
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.920]   the huge, huge thing.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.960]   And that would be lucky to put 300 kilograms into orbit.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:04.800]   You know, so it's like,
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.040]   which one's going to be cheaper to build, you know,
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.880]   ship around all the stuff.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.560]   And then you also look at, you have fixed costs.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.600]   Like the idea of flying a,
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.080]   but this, again,
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.520]   everything in rocket science is a compromise.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.600]   'Cause now you have things like people on console time,
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.060]   all the people that are, you know,
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:23.120]   on comms and working on the rocket,
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.680]   going down to the pad, you know, filing paperwork,
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.680]   doing range control,
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.440]   making sure there's not planes and boats in the way,
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.520]   flight termination.
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.680]   You have all these fixed costs for any launch.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.380]   I don't care how big the rocket is.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.840]   There's a relatively fixed cost.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.280]   So now you say like, okay, I'm going to be paying,
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.160]   well, let's just make a winner.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.440]   I'm going to pay $5 million to fly a rocket
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:45.320]   between all the people going on site,
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.520]   all the propellant, all the licenses, blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.320]   If your fixed cost is $5 million,
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.160]   you can put 300 kilograms in space
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.520]   versus you have a $5 million cost of operation
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.060]   and you can put 5,000 kilograms into space.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.600]   Like it's,
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.920]   the business case is going to send you
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.640]   in one direction pretty quickly.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:06.280]   - So you mentioned aerospike engines.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.680]   I think the internet informed me of your love affair
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.160]   with aerospike engines.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.720]   Find somebody that looks at you
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.080]   the way Tim Nott looks at aerospike engines.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.340]   (laughing)
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.560]   Can you explain what these are?
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.200]   How do they work?
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.400]   What's beautiful to them?
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.360]   How practical are they?
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.400]   Why don't we use them?
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:32.480]   Does it just boil down to the design of the nozzle?
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.200]   So maybe, can you explain how is it possible
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:37.480]   to achieve this thing for an engine to be as efficient
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:41.320]   at, in a vacuum and sea level and all different conditions?
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.080]   - You know what I love about this is that
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.200]   every question you've asked me is like a one hour video
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.800]   on my YouTube channel.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.880]   Now boil it down to 45 seconds.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.720]   - Go.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.560]   - So the aerospike engine basically
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:56.000]   is an inside out engine, more or less.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.520]   So with a traditional engine,
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.520]   we've talked about the combustion chamber and the throat
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.460]   and then it expands out into the nozzle.
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:05.320]   Those walls are containing the pressure, right?
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.520]   Aerospike is the opposite.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.400]   It's basically the pressure of the engine
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.800]   is on the outside of it
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.240]   and it's pushing inward against a spike.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.240]   So it's almost like the difference of if you were,
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.300]   let me think about this.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:22.480]   If you were standing in like a tent or a teepee, right?
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.960]   And you put your arms at the top
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.160]   and you pushed your arms out
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.080]   like into an iron cross or something, you know?
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.320]   You can physically lift the tent
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:31.960]   just by pushing outwards on the tent walls, right?
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.680]   Well, that would be like a traditional nozzle.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.240]   Now aerospike would be almost like squeezing an ice cube.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.280]   You know, if you squeeze an ice cube,
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.880]   you can push in on it and kind of that wedge force
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.440]   will shoot that ice cube.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.640]   So that's kind of what has happened.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.580]   We have the high pressure gases on the outside of the spike
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:46.800]   squeezing in on that spike
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.660]   and then it's pushing up against the,
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:51.700]   you know, 'cause it's equal on both sides
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:53.280]   against like kind of the ramp
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.060]   is pushing up against the rocket.
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:56.340]   So that's where that force comes in
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.740]   is against the nozzle and against the chambers.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:45:59.940]   The hard part with an aerospike.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.620]   So the cool, okay, I guess the cool thing
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:06.620]   about an aerospike is that it can operate in space.
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:10.380]   You can have what's known as a really big expansion ratio.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:12.400]   So that's your ratio between the throat,
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.080]   the area of the throat versus the area of the nozzle exit.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.360]   And remember how the bigger the nozzle is,
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.320]   the it's continually just converting more and more
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.920]   is converting that high energy, hot, high pressure gas
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.720]   into cooler and cooler, lower pressure and faster gas.
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:33.120]   So each little millimeter along that nozzle
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.360]   is just getting it lower pressure and cooler, but faster.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.000]   Now, if you take a big nozzle on earth
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.240]   and you at sea level and you fire it,
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.220]   you can actually get,
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:43.800]   even though we're going from say 300 bar,
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.480]   the Raptor engine, our atmosphere at sea level
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.400]   is about one bar.
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:51.000]   It's pretty much exactly one bar depending on conditions,
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.280]   but you can actually get a nozzle
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.260]   to get way below one bar of pressure.
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:00.720]   So every little, you can go from 300 bar
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.600]   in just two meters down to one bar or below one bar.
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.460]   There's actually a limit.
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:08.560]   You can actually only expand it below,
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.520]   we'll say something like 70%.
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.000]   So you can get down to like 0.7 bar at nozzle exit
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.960]   before the pressure of the atmosphere
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:18.800]   is actually squeezing in on that exhaust
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:21.480]   and tearing it away from the walls of the engine,
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:23.640]   the walls of the nozzle exit.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.880]   And what happens is it's kind of unpredictable.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.000]   You get these pockets, these oscillations,
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.240]   and they'll be so extreme
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.540]   that they'll end up just destroying the nozzle.
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:35.560]   So you can't lower, you can't have a bigger expansion ratio
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.400]   than again, relatively speaking, something like 0.7.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.020]   Like you can't go below,
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:42.120]   you can't get that pressure exit
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:43.780]   too much below ambient air pressure
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:46.160]   before flow separation can destroy the engine.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.160]   - So how come this engine can do so well
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.600]   in different pressure conditions?
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.320]   - So because it's inside out,
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:56.120]   the ambient pressure is pushing the exhaust gas
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:59.120]   into the wall as opposed to a conventional engine
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.200]   that exhaust gas, the ambient air
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.320]   is actually squeezing the exhaust gas
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.760]   away from the walls of the engine.
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:09.100]   And that squeezing away from is what can be destructive.
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:11.520]   So that since it's kind of inside out,
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.400]   the ambient air is pushing the exhaust gas
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.840]   into the engine walls.
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.400]   So you can't have flow separation.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.400]   You won't have flow separation.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.020]   Now what happens is, so you can have this huge,
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.240]   amazingly like efficient vacuum engine
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:26.240]   that has a, we'll say a 200 to one expansion ratio,
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.080]   which is really big.
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.320]   Like a lot of sea level engines are like 35, 40,
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.520]   50 to one expansion ratios.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:35.320]   And then in space, you know, it's common to use like 150,
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.200]   180, 200 to one expansion ratios.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.880]   So an aerospike can have something like 200 to one.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.500]   It's just that the, at sea level,
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:43.540]   it's kind of just getting pushed
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:45.140]   and it's kind of getting cut off early almost,
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:45.980]   but it doesn't matter.
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:46.820]   It's not like destructive.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.640]   It's just not running at its maximum efficiency.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.780]   As it climbs in altitude,
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:53.660]   as the ambient air gets thinner and thinner and thinner,
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.100]   it just inherently is pushing less and less and less
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:59.300]   against the walls of that aerospike engine.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:02.980]   So it actually continually gets more efficient at,
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:05.140]   you know, as it climbs in altitude.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:06.300]   As does a normal engine,
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.240]   but the difference is that you can use
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.520]   that huge expansion ratio at sea level
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:13.840]   and you can't use a huge expansion ratio at sea level
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.160]   with a traditional nozzle.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.920]   - Has anyone actually flown an aerospike engine?
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.400]   - No aerospike engine to date
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.520]   has ever been flown on an orbital rocket.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.340]   - Why not?
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:26.160]   And would you like to see a future where they're used?
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.760]   - Purely because I think they're cool.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.600]   - Yeah.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.420]   - You know, in the same way--
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.640]   - So that's the core of your love affair
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.760]   with aerospike engines is the coolness.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.880]   - It's just, and I said this in my video.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.500]   Actually, outside, before I came in here,
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.580]   I saw an RX-7 in the streets that I just love.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:43.460]   And that uses a rotary engine.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:46.140]   On paper, the rotary engine is like more efficient,
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.680]   does all, you know, smaller, more efficient,
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:48.520]   all these things.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.540]   But in practice, it's like,
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:51.980]   the thing is actually just like unreliable, hot,
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:55.400]   and it, you know, it blah, blah, blah, blah, burns oil.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:56.900]   It's kind of the same thing with the aerospike engine.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.140]   Like, yes, on paper, it's more efficient,
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.540]   but now you have a lot more surface area
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.480]   of your throat area, no matter what,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.800]   is going to have, the throat of the rocket engine
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:09.880]   is always where it's the hottest.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.440]   You know, it's the hardest thing to cool.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.440]   And with an aerospike, if, you know,
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.280]   if it's inside out, now your throat is,
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.400]   no matter what, like way bigger.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.700]   You know, it's almost like the size
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.320]   of the nozzle exit normally,
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.840]   but now it's your hardest thing to cool,
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.360]   and you have a ton of it,
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.480]   and you also have two edges of it, no matter what.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.000]   So even if you have like a, you know,
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.840]   a circle inside a circle,
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.140]   you have like a just insane amount more surface area
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:35.980]   to cool with a limited amount of fuel.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:39.820]   Don't forget, you're using your fuel as your coolant.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.900]   So if you all of a sudden now take your throat area,
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:46.100]   and you have X amount of space that you need to cool,
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:48.180]   you only have, you have a limited supply.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:50.980]   It's like, ugh, it's, sorry, this is the stuff that just--
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:52.840]   - Are there ideas of for cooling,
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:56.260]   for cooling aerospike engines?
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.380]   - It's, same physics apply for an aerospike as they would.
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.320]   So you just run into a limitation.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:04.400]   Like at some point, I'm not flowing enough propellant.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.360]   It scales, it scales kind of poorly.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.860]   Like you can increase the thrust of an aerospike
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:11.960]   by making it bigger and increase the mass flow
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:15.280]   and the fuel going through the throats or the throat,
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:16.960]   but at the same time, like it just,
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.640]   it's at the end of the day, it's physically possible.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.280]   It's a lot more complex.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.220]   You have a lot of issues with cooling,
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.640]   and it just, you end up kind of right back
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:26.880]   where you started.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.320]   So it's like, is it worth it
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.080]   to just keep going down this rabbit hole,
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.020]   trying to engineer this thing to work,
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.880]   when you could have probably spent a tenth
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.360]   of the amount of time just slightly increasing
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.680]   the performance of your normal engine in the first place?
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.960]   - Again, I'm going to anthropomorphize that lesson
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.760]   and apply it to my dating life.
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.300]   And once again, just kidding.
[01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:51.240]   Okay, actually just on a small tangent,
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.480]   since you are also a car guy,
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:57.880]   what's the greatest combustion engine car ever made to you?
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:59.560]   If you had to pick something,
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:03.840]   what's the coolest, the sexiest, the most powerful,
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.640]   the classiest, the most elegant, well-designed?
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:08.480]   I don't know what category.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:09.920]   - A lot of those things are different for me,
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.400]   but I'd still-- - They are?
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:12.980]   - I still, it's funny, 'cause now,
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:14.460]   maybe it's just 'cause it's fresh on mind,
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:18.920]   but I love that mid '90s RX-7,
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:23.920]   which, especially in Japan, they had the 20B, a tri-rotor.
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:26.720]   That is like the coolest engine ever to me.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.920]   - Yeah, what maybe?
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.360]   - The FD RX-7.
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:33.200]   It's just too darn cool, honestly.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.760]   It'd be, there you go.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.760]   - Well, what about the mid '90s that makes it special?
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.120]   - Just that's the only time-- - Everything was--
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.760]   - It's more that I love the engine
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.360]   and I like the car it's attached to.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.740]   I mean, I'm not actually a big fan
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.240]   of '90s styling, personally,
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.760]   but just that the 20B is just such a cool, cool engine.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.960]   And it's twin turbo, sequential turbos.
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:58.920]   So they used, a bigger turbo takes longer to spool up.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.480]   You know, it takes more, it's using that same,
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.640]   like a turbine and a compressor.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.600]   And it just, if it's a large turbine,
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:07.360]   it takes more exhaust gas to get it spooled up.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.560]   So if you have an engine that revs to 9,000 RPM
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:12.120]   and you wanna get a lot of pressure out of that turbo,
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.120]   you have a big turbo, it's gonna take forever.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.400]   Like you're gonna have, you know, your floor,
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.920]   and then like, it's gonna take a long time
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.320]   for that turbo to get spooled up.
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.140]   So they actually did a small turbo on it and a big turbo.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:23.960]   So the small turbo would spool up first,
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.400]   get some boost going through the engine,
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.160]   get that engine operating, get it up to speed,
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.880]   get it, you know, get some power to the wheels.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.720]   And then once that kind of reaches its limit,
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:34.660]   you'd flow it into the, divert the exhaust gas
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:37.520]   into the bigger turbo, it's this sequential turbo.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.320]   And then that now can supplement
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.680]   and actually increase the, you know,
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.920]   overall performance of the vehicle by a lot.
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.960]   And I just, I think that's just so cool.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.960]   It's just like the ultimate, like,
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.840]   brute force, out of the box thinking,
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.320]   and it actually made it into production.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.120]   - Can you, what's it sound like?
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.880]   Can you tell an engine by its sound?
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:00.740]   - It sounds like a really, really, really angry lawnmower.
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.840]   It sounds horrible.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.400]   It's actually a terrible sounding car.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:07.060]   In my opinion, like, it sounds just raspy
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:09.960]   and like the opposite of like a big muscle car.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:12.000]   You know, like a big muscle car has this deep guttural,
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.120]   like, oh, it just, it hits you.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.440]   This is like, it's just gonna annoy the hell out of you
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.280]   and all your neighbors.
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.100]   Like it's-
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:19.160]   - But you love the engineering.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.920]   - I love the engineering of it.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.240]   - So to you, the car is the engine.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.400]   It's not all the surface stuff, all the design stuff,
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.800]   all the, you know, yeah, the elegance,
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.440]   the curves, whatever it is.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:35.440]   - Well, those come and go, you know, to me, styles change.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.280]   - It's forever.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:37.100]   - Yeah.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.400]   - I'm gonna apply that to my dating life once again.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.200]   Metaphors, just keep on coming.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.880]   - Well, if you think about it, like,
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.280]   my taste has changed throughout the years.
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:48.320]   When I first saw a Model 3 Tesla,
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.400]   I thought it was the most hideous car I've ever,
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.960]   without the grill, I was like, this is so stupid.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.160]   It took me all but two months to think
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.600]   that it was one of the coolest looking cars.
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:57.440]   Same with Cybertruck.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.000]   I mourned Cybertruck.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.360]   When I first saw that thing, I was at that thing with,
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.360]   and I went with, we used to do a podcast
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:06.280]   called Our Ludicrous Future.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:07.640]   So we talked a lot about like, you know,
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.220]   cars and EVs and stuff.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.360]   We went to that unveiling and literally, like,
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.240]   we had like almost a non-alcohol induced hangover
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.480]   the next morning of like mourning
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.960]   the hideousness of Cybertruck.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.840]   Come six months later, a year later,
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:23.120]   and I'm like, damn it, that thing's actually kinda cool.
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:25.760]   - Yeah, that also teaches you something about,
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:28.560]   again, it's the thing you said earlier,
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:33.560]   sort of going against the current
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.960]   of the experts of the beliefs or whatever
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.720]   and making a decision from first principles.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:41.040]   Some of that also applies to design and styling
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:42.280]   and fashion and culture and all that.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.320]   - Big time.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.680]   - Some of that, you know, fashion especially.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.520]   It's so interesting.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.440]   - So subjective.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.440]   - Being rebellious against the current fads
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:58.520]   actually is the way to pave the new fads.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:01.320]   - Well, it didn't take long for others to follow.
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.500]   You look at like currently like what Hyundai's doing
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.400]   with their, I forget which one,
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:07.440]   like the Ioniq or something like that.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.840]   It's square, it's boxy, you know, it's a throwback.
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:13.200]   It's 80s, it's got these beautiful retro taillights.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.280]   It's got these square headlights.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:19.120]   It's very inspired by Cybertruck in my opinion.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.960]   It might not be, it might be coincidental
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:24.400]   that we're all kind of getting this retro future vibe.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.560]   - I personally like the boxy.
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.080]   So I never, I still haven't understood Porsches.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:37.240]   I still can't quite understand the small size,
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.080]   the curves, I don't quite get it.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.840]   - See, like I said, I don't love the look of the RX-7.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:46.960]   I don't love it, but I love it because of the engineering,
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.040]   I guess, that it represents, you know what I mean?
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.480]   - Yeah, it's not the surface stuff.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.880]   It's the deep down stuff.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.440]   - It's that 50/50 weight distribution that matters.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:59.520]   - All right, let's talk about Starship a little bit.
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.720]   We've been sneaking up to it
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:04.120]   from a bunch of different directions.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:08.960]   Can you just say, what is Starship
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:12.160]   and what is the most impressive thing to you about it?
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:14.960]   I mean, you've talked about sort of the engines involved.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:17.200]   Maybe you haven't really, you're kind of
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:21.880]   like dancing around it, but because this is such a crucial
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.480]   thing in terms of the next few years,
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.520]   in terms of your own life personally,
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.800]   and also just human civilization reaching out to the stars,
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.840]   it seems like Starship is a really important vehicle
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.680]   to making that happen.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.920]   So what is this thing that we're talking about?
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:42.920]   - Yeah, so Starship is currently in development,
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.000]   the world's largest, most powerful rocket ever built,
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.080]   fully reusable rocket, a two-stage rocket.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.640]   So the booster is landed, and all this
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:56.200]   is currently aspirational until it's working.
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:00.240]   So I'll say what it's aspirationally going to be,
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:01.760]   and obviously I have faith that that will happen,
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.280]   but just factually.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.120]   So the booster will be reused,
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:06.880]   it's landed and refueled and reused.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.920]   The upper stage will be landed, refueled, and reused,
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.600]   and ideally rapidly, in the sense,
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.240]   not talking about months or weeks of refurbishment,
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:18.080]   but literally talking about like mild inspections,
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:21.360]   and ideally like under 24-hour reuse,
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.500]   where you literally land it and fly it like an airplane.
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:27.760]   So it utilizes liquid methane and liquid oxygen
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.760]   as its propellants.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.320]   It utilizes, the current iterations of it
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:37.200]   are 33 Raptor engines on the booster engine, on the booster,
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.000]   and six Raptors on the second stage.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.320]   So there'll be three that are vacuum optimized,
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:45.080]   and three that are sea level optimized on the upper stage,
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.800]   that are primarily, they'll be used, I think,
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.260]   at stage separation anyway, in space,
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.520]   but their main reason that they use them
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.440]   is so they can use them for landing too,
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:56.140]   the three sea level engines,
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:59.040]   to be able to propulsively land the upper stage as well.
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.260]   - So the three Raptor engines are the ones
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:03.800]   that generate the thrust that makes it
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.600]   the most powerful rocket ever built.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:08.400]   - By almost double.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:09.920]   - Compared to the Saturn V, really?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.360]   - The N1 had 45 mega newtons of thrust,
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:16.620]   the Saturn V had, I think, 35 or 40 mega newtons of thrust,
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:18.440]   and this has 75 mega newtons,
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.740]   so we're talking almost double.
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:24.320]   (both laughing)
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:27.200]   It's a lot of power.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.320]   - That could be the sexiest thing I've ever heard.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:34.320]   Okay, so what are the different testing that's happening?
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.880]   So what's the static fire
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.280]   with some of these Raptors look like,
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.120]   and where do we stand?
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.280]   You were just talking about offline,
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.920]   like the thing that happened yesterday.
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:46.160]   - Yeah. - That was impressive.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.420]   - You know, everything in this is kind of iterations,
[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:51.320]   and so the milestones that we're seeing,
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:53.720]   we actually have on everydayastronaut.com,
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:54.920]   we have a milestone checklist
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.720]   of all the things we're hoping to see,
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:57.640]   that we kind of need to see
[01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:00.560]   before the first orbital flight of this rocket.
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.900]   So a big milestone that got checked off yesterday
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.640]   was a wet dress rehearsal.
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:07.800]   So it's literally like fueling the rocket up,
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.520]   getting ready to do everything
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.960]   but lighting the engines, basically.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.600]   So we're talking about loading it with propellant
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:14.680]   all the way, and this is the first time,
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.280]   yep, right there. - Where's the milestones?
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:17.120]   - Right there at the top.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.900]   Click that big picture.
[02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:21.720]   Yep, just anywhere, that big picture, yep.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:23.660]   - So there's the wet dress rehearsal,
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:25.640]   so what's the wet dress rehearsal?
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:28.400]   - Yep, so that's where they, for the first time,
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.200]   they filled it completely to the brim
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.640]   with both liquid oxygen and liquid methane.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.340]   Now, they had done component level testing
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:36.240]   where they fill it with liquid nitrogen,
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:38.280]   which is, you know, it's an inert gas,
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:39.760]   so it's not, like, say it leaks out,
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.400]   it's not gonna explode.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.680]   You could just have a big, giant pool of liquid nitrogen
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:45.420]   like flooding the area,
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.040]   but it's not gonna be an explosion.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:48.640]   So they've done that for cryo testing
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.000]   to make sure all the components and stuff can handle,
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.400]   you know, being at cryogenic temperatures.
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:54.600]   It's kind of a good analog
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.440]   before you start putting your fuel
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.620]   and your oxidizer in there.
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:00.160]   But now, as of yesterday,
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.780]   they fully fueled the rocket with propellant,
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:04.800]   both stages, the first stage and the second stage,
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:06.520]   while fully stacked on the pad.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.640]   Like, basically, I mean, it was the first sense
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:10.460]   we really got of, like, this is what it's gonna look like
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.140]   right before it takes off.
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:13.600]   You know, kind of breathing,
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:15.440]   coming to life for the first time.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.760]   - What does the pad look like?
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.920]   So there's a few interesting aspects to this.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.820]   What's up with the chopsticks and all of that?
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.180]   - Yeah, so the launch pad is unique.
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.340]   I've never seen anything like it
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:30.900]   in the prior history of space flight.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:32.940]   But it's a really simple launch stand.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:33.980]   They basically have like this,
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:35.520]   almost looks like a stool,
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.580]   like a milking a cow stool thing
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.060]   with a big giant--
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:41.780]   - Now I know you're from Iowa, but yeah.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.180]   (laughing)
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:44.620]   Yes, we all know what that stool looks like.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.060]   - Oh yeah, we all been sitting on that stool milking cows.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:50.060]   - Yeah, been there, done that.
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:51.420]   - With a giant hole in the middle,
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:52.900]   and that hole in the middle of that stool
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:53.980]   is where the rocket sits,
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:56.380]   and it sits on these launch clamps.
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:58.900]   And then next to it is the,
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:00.500]   so that's the orbital launch mount,
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:03.260]   and then next to it are the OLM, some people will say.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.500]   Next to it is the orbital launch tower, the OLT.
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:11.500]   And that is not only integral to fueling up the upper stage,
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:12.820]   you know, the upper stage has to have
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:14.460]   propellant lines run to it
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:17.820]   so that they can fill it with propellant and all that.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:20.100]   But it also, they ended up making it
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:22.020]   so instead of having a big crane on site
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:23.860]   to stack the two on top of each other,
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:26.700]   they literally just used that tower as a crane.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:28.140]   So the crane has these giant arms,
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.460]   lovingly called the chopsticks,
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:32.500]   or the whole system can be called Mechazilla.
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:33.460]   And that will grab onto,
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:35.340]   first it'll grab onto the booster,
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:37.420]   pick it up off of its transporter
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:39.980]   that transports it from the production site,
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:42.460]   lifts it up, puts it down onto the launch mount,
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:44.820]   and then it will pick up the second stage
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:46.260]   or the upper stage starship,
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:49.660]   and plop it down on top of the booster.
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.620]   And they did that for the first time last year.
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:53.220]   Actually, I think it was like Valentine's last year
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:55.700]   was the first time they used the chopsticks to stack it.
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.300]   And now they're doing it quite frequently, you know.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.980]   But ultimately, those chopsticks
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:01.300]   have to serve a second purpose.
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.140]   They're actually going to utilize,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:06.300]   if you say, it's not so much they're going to catch
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:07.620]   the booster with these chopsticks,
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:08.540]   it's not like it's, you know,
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:11.260]   a dad trying to catch a falling child, you know.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.860]   It's more that the booster and the starship
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:17.300]   will someday land on those arms.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:18.180]   - Yeah.
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:20.740]   - So they're more or less stationary.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:22.660]   I'm sure there's some bit of, you know,
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:23.760]   adjustment that the arms will do,
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:26.580]   but more or less, the rocket's going to propulsively land
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:27.940]   and get picked up by like,
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:32.420]   what's essentially like two relatively small ball joints
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:34.300]   that hold the entire thing.
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:38.700]   And so it has to land very precisely on these mounts
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:40.620]   and onto the launch mount.
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:43.020]   And that's what's going to just place it back onto the stand
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:46.260]   and allow it to be refueled and fly again.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:48.180]   - What's the idea of using the arms
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:50.860]   versus having a launch pad to land on?
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:52.500]   What's the benefit?
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.540]   - You are basically removing the mass
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.300]   of what would be heavy landing legs,
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.660]   and you're putting kind of that landing infrastructure
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:03:59.700]   onto a ground system.
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:02.740]   So you're not having to carry those landing legs into orbit.
[02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:04.660]   - But it's also elevated off the ground.
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.780]   Is there some aspect of that
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.660]   where you don't have to balance the thrust and all the--
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:10.860]   - You can negate some of those,
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:12.300]   like there's like plume-plume interactions.
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:14.460]   There's like, you know, the exhaust hitting concrete,
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:15.900]   and especially with a rocket this big,
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:19.420]   it's gonna use like three Raptor engines firing.
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:22.180]   If you have them firing really close to the ground,
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:24.260]   you're just gonna absolutely destroy and crater the ground,
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:26.260]   and you're gonna have to refurbish the ground
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:28.460]   and the landing pad every time,
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.620]   and, you know, or have huge landing legs
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:33.340]   that are super long and tall, you know,
[02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:36.660]   to make it so it's elevated enough to not do that.
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:39.740]   So yeah, you're avoiding that whole mess
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.780]   by catching it high enough off the ground
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:43.580]   that you don't have to factor that in.
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:45.100]   - That's how many engines are involved
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.260]   in the landing part, is it three Raptor engines?
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.420]   - Well, we haven't actually, you know,
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:52.380]   we haven't to date seen the exact landing sequence,
[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:53.940]   so it might be something like at first,
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:56.460]   they might light up, you know, seven or something,
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:05:00.020]   or nine or something, some number to accelerate quickly,
[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:01.820]   or decelerate quickly, same thing,
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:05.500]   and then shut it down to three or something
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:07.700]   for a little bit more granular control.
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:10.820]   'Cause unlike Falcon 9, Starship has enough engines
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:12.940]   and variability to actually, if it needed to hover,
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:15.860]   you know, to maybe more precisely align itself with the pad,
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:17.460]   it would have that capability.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.340]   And especially having multiple engines, you know,
[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:21.100]   if you only have a single engine running,
[02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:24.260]   you can't really roll, you know, your roll axis,
[02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:25.180]   you can do pitch and yaw,
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.740]   because the engine is kind of like a rudder,
[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:30.100]   it can move in two axes,
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:32.420]   so you can easily pitch and yaw the vehicle,
[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:35.580]   but to actually induce roll along its vertical axis,
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:38.340]   you would either need like auxiliary engines to roll it,
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.780]   or you'd need a pair of engines
[02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:42.700]   so they can be opposed and induce roll.
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.740]   So by having two or three running,
[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:47.460]   they have all three axes of control that they would need,
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:48.620]   kind of like a broomstick, you know,
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.980]   and balancing a broomstick on your hand,
[02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:52.060]   they can just move it over,
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:55.220]   and if they need to align it to those landing nubs,
[02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:56.660]   you know, on the landing arms and stuff like that,
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.780]   then they can do that.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:01.460]   - Speaking of pitch and yaw,
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:05.820]   the thing, so Starship flips on its belly flops,
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:10.100]   there's a interesting kind of maneuver
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:12.220]   on the way down to land.
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:14.140]   Can you describe that maneuver, what's involved with that?
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:16.300]   - Yeah, so this is definitely a first.
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:18.340]   I don't think anything's tried landing like this before,
[02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:21.820]   but the idea is when you're falling through the atmosphere,
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:23.860]   the atmosphere could actually do a lot of work for you.
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:25.500]   You know, you're moving quickly,
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.700]   something is falling from space,
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:29.020]   there's a lot of energy involved.
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:30.860]   - You have a really good video on this as well.
[02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:32.340]   (laughing)
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:33.700]   - And-- - Thank you.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:37.700]   - As it's falling, you know, you can,
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:40.660]   you wanna let the atmosphere do as much work as it can.
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:44.340]   And so if you have a unsymmetric,
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:46.100]   you know, it's not a ball that's falling,
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.540]   this is some kind of object with shape,
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:50.780]   some, you know, at one face of it
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:53.140]   is going to have more surface area than the other face.
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:55.580]   So, you know, in the shape of like a cylinder,
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:58.220]   if you're falling, you know, like a soda can,
[02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:00.580]   if you're falling top or bottom first,
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:02.700]   it's a certain amount of surface area.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:03.780]   If you flip that on its side,
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:05.740]   you actually have a lot more surface area.
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:07.900]   So with the same exact vehicle,
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:09.340]   you can actually have a lot more drag,
[02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:11.220]   you can actually slow it down a lot more
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:13.700]   using the exact same like, same atmosphere,
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:17.340]   same vehicle, just by turning it 90 degrees,
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:18.660]   you can slow it down substantially,
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:21.380]   like three or four times slower.
[02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:24.340]   So that's energy that you don't have to use anywhere else.
[02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:25.980]   You don't have to use an engine to slow you down,
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.020]   you don't have to do anything else.
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:29.180]   So SpaceX realized, okay, if we flip this thing on its side
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:31.300]   and let it fall like a skydiver almost, you know,
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:32.740]   instead of like pencil diving into the pool,
[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:33.860]   you're belly flopping.
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:37.500]   You're maximizing the amount of surface area
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:39.900]   that's in the wind stream that's being slowed down.
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:42.660]   But obviously like, in order to land,
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:44.900]   especially if you're SpaceX and you know,
[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:48.260]   Elon's obsessed with like not having different parts,
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:50.860]   you know, he wants, the best part is no part.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:53.220]   So if you're going to land with the engines,
[02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:55.980]   you might as well use engines that you've already have,
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:57.380]   the engines that are, you know,
[02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:59.380]   used for the other portions of flight.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:01.460]   So you kick those on and you use those engines
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:03.020]   to actually turn it 90 degrees
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.620]   from belly flopping to feet first.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:09.100]   And that way you can use those same engines to land
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:11.580]   and you don't have to have like auxiliary landing engines.
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:13.220]   You don't have to have forces, you know,
[02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:15.580]   even if you were to land like on its belly
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.060]   with a separate set of engines,
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:19.140]   not only would those engines weigh a lot, you know,
[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:21.700]   and be extra complexity, et cetera, et cetera,
[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:23.300]   but you also don't have to make the ship
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.980]   be able to handle landing, you know, like on its belly
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:28.540]   as opposed to having the forces be vertical through it.
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:30.580]   - But it's a giant thing.
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:33.580]   You have to rotate in the air.
[02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:34.420]   - Huge.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.300]   - And as you also highlight, you know,
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:41.060]   there's liquid fuel slushing around in the tank.
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:44.820]   So like you can't, I guess, use that fuel directly.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:46.060]   You have to have another kind of fuel.
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:49.260]   Like there's just complexities there that are involved.
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:53.620]   Plus the actual maneuver is difficult from the,
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:57.100]   like what are the thrusters that actually make that,
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:58.380]   make all that happen?
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:02.940]   You're adding a lot of complexity, not a lot,
[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:06.060]   but your complexity to the maneuver
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:08.100]   and possibility where failure could happen
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:10.860]   in order to sort of save,
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:14.260]   in order for the air to do some of the work.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:16.380]   So what is some of that complexity?
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:18.180]   Just you can linger on it.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:19.940]   - You know, if you think about what it's gonna take
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.560]   to go from horizontal to vertical,
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:24.660]   this rocket in particular,
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:26.940]   Starship has these big flaps.
[02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:30.780]   So it has kind of two nose flaps and two rearward flaps.
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:31.980]   The rearward flaps are a lot bigger
[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:33.620]   because the majority of the mass,
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:35.820]   the engines and stuff are in the back of the vehicle.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:37.940]   So in order to kind of be stable,
[02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:40.140]   and they just fold themselves inwards,
[02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:42.700]   like on their dihedral angle,
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:46.620]   at a dihedral angle in order to increase or decrease the drag.
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:49.340]   So you can control it's all three axes of control
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:52.220]   while it's falling on its belly,
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:53.220]   you can control it that way
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:55.380]   using these four different fins.
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:57.560]   So you have these giant moving surfaces
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:00.220]   that take thousands of horsepower.
[02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:01.420]   It's just insane amount of torque
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:02.920]   in order to move these quickly enough
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:05.420]   to be a valid control surface.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:07.540]   So that's a huge complication is moving these fins
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:09.820]   and developing that landing algorithm
[02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:13.820]   and the control for a huge vehicle with flaps
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:17.460]   going like in and out, in and out, in and out to stay stable.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:19.780]   Then right as you light the engines,
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:22.180]   now all of a sudden you want the top,
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:23.620]   you wanna flip the rocket 90 degrees
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:26.460]   so the rearward flaps, the bottom flaps fold in,
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.240]   they tuck all the way in to minimize drag.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:30.480]   That's gonna make it wanna swing down.
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:31.700]   You extend the upper flaps,
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:34.020]   that makes it so the nose wants to pitch up.
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:36.000]   You kick on the engines,
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.760]   they're now lighting all three engines,
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.140]   at least as of the last successful attempts.
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.060]   They light all three of the sea level Raptor engines
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:43.580]   and they're pitched all the way,
[02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:45.860]   like 10 or 15 degrees or whatever
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.860]   the maximum pitch is on them.
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:51.060]   And that induces, it does that kick maneuver
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:53.880]   to kick it over from horizontal to vertical.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:55.700]   Now the problem is you lit your engines
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.100]   while you're horizontal.
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:11:00.060]   So they put some horizontal velocity
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:02.160]   into the rocket, they push the rocket.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.460]   At the time of lighting those engines,
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:06.360]   the nose is facing the horizon
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.040]   and the engines are facing the opposite horizon.
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.260]   So you now shot it a decent amount
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:14.800]   in the direction that you're not falling.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:19.000]   So you have to factor that in to where you're landing
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.200]   'cause you're gonna land on this precise,
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.840]   in this case you're gonna land on the inside
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.960]   of the loving arms of the chopsticks,
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.840]   the creed arms wide open,
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.200]   you're gonna try to land inside this.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.520]   - Exactly, the song that will be playing
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.280]   through my head as I watch this now.
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:33.980]   Thank you, thank you for forever joining those two.
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:36.440]   I appreciate this.
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:38.160]   - And you have to very precisely control.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.240]   So what you have to do is now that it's done that kick,
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:42.980]   you also have to cancel out that horizontal velocity.
[02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:46.160]   So it's actually gonna rotate beyond 90 degrees
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:49.160]   to cancel out that horizontal velocity
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:52.560]   and then modulate the engines to make it so the thrust
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:55.680]   is perfect so that it can control itself
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:57.360]   into a controlled landing.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.240]   And all this is done in like 500 meters, like 1500 feet.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:03.560]   You're doing all of those things
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:04.960]   stupidly close to the ground.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:06.240]   It looks absurd.
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:08.240]   So far they've done five of these tests.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:11.480]   The first four all blew up.
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:14.640]   They're all coming in from about 10 kilometers
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:15.800]   or 33,000 feet.
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:19.560]   Falling, flipping, again, this thing's huge.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:22.280]   That just the booster or just the upper stage of this
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.640]   is like 50 meters tall.
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.160]   So it's 150, it's like 45 meters,
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.520]   about 50 meters tall, about 165 feet tall.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.240]   Nine meters wide to 30 feet wide.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:34.160]   It weighs something like,
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.440]   God, I don't remember if it's something
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:38.880]   like 120 metric tons, so 120,000 kilograms,
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:42.040]   two quarter of a million pounds empty.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.840]   And it's doing this flip maneuver.
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.520]   And it has to do all this perfectly.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.080]   So the first four attempts of this
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.240]   were pretty spectacular failures.
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:51.720]   - So just to clarify, which stage is doing this maneuver?
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:54.720]   - It's the upper stage is doing this belly flop maneuver.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:59.000]   So this is the stage that would presumably
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.720]   have humans on board if we were to use.
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.360]   - And if things continue to plan.
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:08.440]   Now here's something I would love to see.
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:09.960]   Just saying this.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:13.440]   If you already have these big aero surfaces, the flaps,
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.680]   they also have to move.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:16.840]   They're on heavy motors and hinges and flaps
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:18.080]   and all that stuff.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.720]   I'm actually surprised that for Earth,
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.520]   they aren't just looking at landing it horizontally
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:24.280]   on a runway like the space shuttle.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.000]   - Ooh.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.640]   - I mean, that worked.
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:28.720]   The Bron did it.
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:30.600]   You know, the Soviet Union's Bron.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:32.600]   I rolled my R real hard there, sorry.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:33.560]   - Thank you, wow.
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:35.040]   - Wow, really good space.
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.080]   - I'm very impressed, I'm very impressed.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:38.680]   - And you know, the Bron did it.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:41.520]   We have other space planes like the X-37B.
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.320]   We have the upcoming Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser.
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:46.880]   It's, yeah, you have some extra mass in the wings,
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.080]   but so does Starship.
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.560]   Starship has the extra mass of those flaps
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:53.760]   and the motors and the hinges and all that stuff.
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.120]   I would like to see the trade on like,
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:59.560]   is it actually lighter weight to do that
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.920]   versus doing what SpaceX is doing?
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:04.760]   So yeah, I mean, that's the funny thing.
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:07.320]   I think realistically, if Elon walks in the door tomorrow
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:09.480]   and says, guys, we did some simulations
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.560]   and actually it's like, we can get another 5,000 kilograms
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:14.480]   into space if we just land it horizontally.
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:16.760]   If we kind of give up on our ego and land horizontally,
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:19.360]   at least on Earth, then, you know,
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.720]   I think they could be doing that pretty quickly.
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.440]   'Cause that's the thing is,
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.560]   this ultimate thing has been to land on Mars
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:28.360]   and other planets, and Mars doesn't have a runway,
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.120]   doesn't have a thick enough atmosphere
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:32.920]   to utilize aerodynamic flight like that.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:36.000]   So you have to do propulsive landing for Mars.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.120]   You're gonna land on an unprepared surface, you know?
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:41.080]   So it has to be able to do this at some point.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:45.000]   It sounds ridiculous, and it is,
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.400]   but the ultimate goal of it is to land on Mars.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.680]   - There's not much of an atmosphere to like,
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.280]   to help you with the, for the belly flop to be useful.
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.520]   - There's only 1% the atmosphere on Mars
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.040]   as there is on Earth, but you still wanna utilize
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.520]   as much of that atmosphere as possible.
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.280]   So in the upper atmosphere, it's still going to be
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:05.360]   coming in more or less kind of perpendicular
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:06.200]   to the airstream.
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.920]   I guess it's probably more like, you know,
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.840]   60 degrees, 70 degrees to the airstream,
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.600]   like where it's belly flopping.
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.380]   And it's gonna especially do that on Mars.
[02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:17.460]   It's gonna need to, you know, use up as,
[02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:19.400]   let the little bit of atmosphere there is,
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.880]   you know, you're coming in at insane velocities.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:23.720]   And so even that 1% thin atmosphere
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:25.560]   is still going to do a lot of work.
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:30.240]   Now on Mars, there's only 38% of Earth's gravity on Mars.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:32.720]   So the belly flop maneuver is a lot,
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:34.160]   it could be a lot more conservative.
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:37.300]   You could do that at like 5,000 feet up,
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.960]   and it just wouldn't matter as much
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:41.480]   'cause there's not as much gravity loss or gravity drag.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.800]   So you can kind of just more slowly, gently,
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:46.080]   you know, you don't have to do this crazy extravagant
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:49.000]   like belly flop, you know, flip maneuver.
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:51.200]   But it would still, something at some point,
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.240]   you would transition from more or less
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:55.000]   perpendicular to the airstream to, you know,
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000]   on a horizontal to landing vertically.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.800]   - I like how we're having this old, boring conversation
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:04.180]   about the differences of landing on Earth versus on Mars.
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:10.760]   This is surreal that this is actually a real conversation,
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:13.800]   that this is something that we're discussing.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.640]   'Cause it has to do both.
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:16.600]   - Yeah.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:19.880]   But in my opinion, I think we'll pretty quickly
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.560]   see an evolution of Starship that's like
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:24.800]   dedicated versions for certain tasks.
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:26.680]   And at the end of the day, again,
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:29.300]   if someone runs a simulation and says
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:31.760]   it's actually more efficient and it's better
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:34.100]   just to land horizontally on a runway,
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:35.760]   then that's what's gonna happen.
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:39.320]   You know, it doesn't matter, but they still will develop,
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:41.080]   you know, if the ultimate goal is to land on Mars,
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:44.040]   then they'll have a dedicated Mars variant, you know,
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:46.720]   which will likely look different than the Earth variant,
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:48.400]   you know, and they'll probably be launched
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.560]   on the same booster, you know what I mean?
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:51.400]   So there's--
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:53.440]   - Oh, you mean like that particular vehicle
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:55.000]   will not be returning back to Earth,
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]   it'll need to be modified.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.560]   'Cause the ultimate is to have one Starship
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.120]   that goes to Mars, lands on Mars,
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:03.520]   then takes off of Mars, lands back on Earth,
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:05.000]   and is reused again.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.120]   - Yeah. - Over and over and over.
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:07.440]   - And there's a chance that you, you know,
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.080]   you have just a cycler, just a, you know,
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.440]   if you're, at the end of the day,
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:14.280]   you're just really trying to see what is most feasible,
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:15.620]   what's the most efficient.
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:17.440]   You literally have a vehicle dedicated to Mars.
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.720]   Mars is easy to do a single stage orbit.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:22.400]   It's a lot lower gravity, a lot thinner atmosphere.
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.760]   You can easily do a single stage orbit.
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:27.320]   You get into orbit, you'd park to a dedicated, you know,
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.360]   transfer vehicle that goes between Earth and Mars.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.280]   It only stays in space.
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:31.880]   You don't have heat shields, you don't have landing legs,
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:34.280]   you don't have all these things that you need.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.440]   And ideally, it's nuclear powered, so it's super efficient.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.600]   That gets you back to Earth.
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:40.440]   Once you're at Earth, you rendezvous again
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:42.440]   with another landing starship,
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:45.840]   and that starship might be a horizontal runway starship,
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:48.640]   you know, like there's no, I don't see the,
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:50.640]   and I think ultimately it'll win out
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.360]   where we don't have a one size fits all.
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:54.880]   I think that's the flaw of the space shuttle,
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.880]   really, is that it was trying to do everything
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:58.960]   and ended up kind of doing nothing well.
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.040]   But that's, I think, what SpaceX has proven.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.680]   I mean, SpaceX already has variants coming.
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:04.580]   There's already going to be a dedicated lunar lander
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:06.760]   for NASA, for the Artemis program.
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:08.840]   There's already going to be a tanker variant.
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:11.880]   There's already going to be likely just a pure cargo version.
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:13.800]   There's likely going to be a human version.
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:16.640]   We'll likely see evolutions of this thing happen,
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:18.720]   you know, relatively quickly.
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:20.520]   - And once it's all working,
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:23.920]   it's only a matter of weeks before people riding on it
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:26.520]   will be complaining about the speed of the wifi.
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.200]   (laughing)
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:30.440]   As the old, like, Louis C.K. joke,
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.000]   with like, you're flying on a chair through the air.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.280]   It's incredible.
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:37.760]   - You didn't even know this existed,
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:39.960]   and now you're complaining about it.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:41.480]   - It's great. - Exactly.
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:44.400]   - So you tweeted, "Fun fact about Starship.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.720]   "By doing the flip around 500 meters
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:50.440]   "versus higher up, like 2,000 meters,
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:55.440]   "the difference in delta-v is 500 meters per second.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:58.000]   "That's a 20-ton fuel saving,
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.360]   "which means basically 20 tons more you can put into orbit.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.820]   "That's more than Falcon 9 has ever launched,
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:07.120]   "just by flipping later."
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:08.040]   - That's really interesting.
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.080]   So that was the decision, too, to flip close to the ground.
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:12.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:13.200]   The closer to the ground, the better.
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:16.240]   The more, again, the more the atmosphere is doing work,
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:18.240]   and, you know, we get into,
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.600]   that video really dives into, like,
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:21.080]   gravity losses and gravity drag.
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:22.680]   The more time you're spent,
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.520]   every second that your rocket engine is running,
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:27.560]   Earth is stealing 9.8 meters per second
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.120]   of acceleration against you.
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:31.080]   There's just inherently 9.8 meters per second
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:32.720]   squared of acceleration.
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:35.300]   So every second that engine is running,
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:38.280]   the first big majority of your thrust
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:41.040]   is actually being just stolen by Earth's gravity well.
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:43.400]   So the longer you're fighting that,
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.800]   the more inefficient it is.
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:46.520]   So I mean, the best thing would be,
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:49.840]   you flip at 100 meters off the ground,
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.760]   you light all your engines to maximum thrust,
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.720]   and you pull 50 Gs, you know,
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:55.820]   and you land on a dime, basically.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.200]   Obviously, there's no margin there,
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.840]   and there's diminishing returns on that gravity loss thing
[02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:02.520]   and in your high thrust weight ratios.
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:04.520]   So that's a pretty good compromise.
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:05.400]   Yes, it looks scary,
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:07.340]   but they could be a lot more aggressive with that, yeah,
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.820]   and squeeze out even a little bit better performance,
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.020]   but there are diminishing returns.
[02:20:11.020 --> 02:20:14.380]   So that's kind of the magic number we've seen so far today,
[02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:17.460]   but we'll likely see that, you know, be played with.
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:19.240]   - You've attended some of these.
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.300]   What does it feel like to see Starship in person?
[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:23.900]   First of all, when it's just sitting there stacked,
[02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:27.660]   and second of all, when it's doing some of these tests,
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:29.460]   some of these maneuvers?
[02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:32.260]   - Well, first off, if you have the freedom of traveling
[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:35.320]   and happen to live within a reasonable,
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:39.640]   either by plane or car, it's worth going down to South Texas.
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:42.500]   So Starbase is right on the border of Mexico
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:45.180]   and the United States, in the very southern tip of Texas,
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:47.140]   right along the Rio Grande,
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:51.800]   and it's insane because it's right along a public highway.
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:53.800]   You can literally, anyone can drive down this,
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.440]   assuming it's not closed for testing,
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:57.800]   'cause they do close the highways during the week
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:20:59.800]   a decent amount while they're doing tests,
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:03.980]   but sans any of those days, anyone can just drive down
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.620]   and see these things up close and personal
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:06.460]   with their own eyes.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:10.500]   Like we're talking, you know, from 100, 200 meters away,
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.040]   you know, so two football fields away
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:14.220]   from the world's biggest, most powerful rocket.
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:16.700]   Imagine being able to do that during the, you know,
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:20.700]   Soviet Union and, you know, during the N1 and the Saturn V,
[02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:22.540]   you know, imagine just being able to drive up
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.100]   right next to the launch pad.
[02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:28.560]   There's no way, you know, and so to have this kind of access
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.580]   to this program is so incredible.
[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:33.780]   The craziest thing is when you're driving out
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:38.780]   on Highway 4, it's bumpy, it's riddled with potholes now
[02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:41.220]   because of all the insane amount of trucks
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:42.580]   having to go out there and traffic,
[02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:45.020]   and you're going through this, it's just this weird,
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:46.020]   you're like, where am I?
[02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:48.540]   You occasionally are seeing, like you can kind of see the,
[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:50.260]   I mean, you can see Mexico out your right window
[02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:51.620]   as you're driving down this highway, you know,
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:53.260]   and you're just sitting there, like, where am I?
[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:55.420]   And then all of a sudden you kind of turn this corner
[02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:57.140]   and the trees and the brush kind of clear out,
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:59.160]   and all of a sudden you get a sense of everything
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.160]   on the horizon, and at that point you're pretty much
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.700]   five miles on the nose or eight kilometers away.
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:07.540]   And from there, you can just see through the heat haze,
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:10.180]   through the, you know, the atmospheric distortion,
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:12.660]   and you just see this weird, like,
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:15.480]   it looks like a city almost on the horizon, you know?
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:17.660]   There's tons of these tall buildings,
[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:20.960]   there's a weird ominous launch tower thing
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.120]   with arms wide open, and sometimes,
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:26.740]   and, you know, a giant metal rocket.
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:30.880]   And it just looks so, so weird.
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:34.620]   I mean, it's, the word surreal, I think, by definition,
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:37.820]   I think if you are expecting it, it's not surreal.
[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:39.100]   I think surreal kind of means, like,
[02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:41.580]   unexpected surprise or whatever, you know?
[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:43.940]   Even if you're expecting it, even if you've seen pictures,
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:46.540]   even if everything, it is surreal.
[02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:47.380]   - Yeah.
[02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:50.980]   - You stand there and you just go, what is this?
[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:55.980]   - And also, I mean, there's a kind of magical aspect
[02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:59.580]   to the, this is the place where, over the next few years,
[02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:04.380]   we'll start, as a human species, reaching out there,
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:05.760]   traveling out there.
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:09.020]   - We'll for sure see the development of the rockets
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:11.660]   that I think will take us further than ever before.
[02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:13.300]   Be born right there.
[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:18.300]   - What's it like to witness the actual testing of Starship?
[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:24.620]   - So far, it's been high stakes, like, it's been insane,
[02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:26.940]   so the first I kind of mentioned earlier,
[02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:29.140]   there's been SN8, 9, 10, 11, and 15
[02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:30.980]   that have all done these suborbital hops.
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:33.020]   The highest one went 12.5 kilometers
[02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:36.540]   and the rest of the four went 10 kilometers in altitude
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.980]   and then turned off the engines and just fell.
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:41.660]   Now, the cool thing about that is the general public
[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:43.660]   could be about five miles away,
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:45.660]   so again, like eight kilometers away,
[02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:50.140]   and the weird thing is this rocket's slowly accelerating.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:52.080]   They didn't want to exceed a certain speed,
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.820]   so they didn't have to worry about the aerodynamics of it.
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.140]   They just slowly climbed,
[02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:56.940]   and it probably also appeased the FAA.
[02:23:56.940 --> 02:23:58.500]   They were like, "Here, we'll just limit
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:01.180]   "the thrust to weight ratio and just make it
[02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:03.660]   "so it's slow and controlled, no big deal."
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:06.300]   So it's basically more or less like slightly above a hover,
[02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:10.260]   just climbing for minutes, for like four or five minutes,
[02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:12.780]   you just hear and feel the roar of this thing.
[02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:16.660]   Normal rockets, after the first 30 seconds or minute,
[02:24:16.660 --> 02:24:20.220]   they're so far away that it's just diminishing.
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:21.700]   It's just fading, fading, fading, fading.
[02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:23.220]   You still get that rumble, that sense,
[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:27.460]   but those first five flights, the suborbital hops were,
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:29.100]   just, I'll cherish them forever,
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.380]   'cause you're watching this thing
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:33.180]   that you've driven up next to,
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:34.820]   you've seen it with your own eyes,
[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:36.960]   that's bigger than most buildings
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:40.180]   in a fairly dense urban area.
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:41.840]   It's this massive thing.
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:43.540]   You stand there, you stood there, you look at it,
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:44.820]   you're like, "Wow, that's crazy."
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:45.820]   You've seen people working on it,
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:47.780]   they're little ants compared to it.
[02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:49.660]   Then you drive away, and you see it on the horizon,
[02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:51.220]   and all of a sudden, that thing leaves.
[02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:52.340]   It starts moving.
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:53.700]   - Hovering. - Hovering.
[02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:55.860]   - Essentially. - The first time,
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:25:00.260]   I mean, for me, at least, I put my hands on my head.
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:02.700]   I can't help it.
[02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:04.020]   It's not, I don't know what it is.
[02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:05.980]   - It's surreal, like you said.
[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:08.140]   - I don't know what in human nature decides
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:10.180]   this is what to do when you can't believe something,
[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:11.940]   but that's what happens.
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:13.260]   When that thing first took off,
[02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:18.100]   it was just like my brain couldn't process seeing,
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:20.580]   'cause I had spent so much time driving around
[02:25:20.580 --> 02:25:21.420]   and seeing it, and all of a sudden,
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:22.660]   you're watching it just take off,
[02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:24.540]   and you're like, "It's moving."
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:25.780]   And all these, you know,
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:27.620]   the most complicated rocket engines ever made
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:29.540]   are all firing simultaneously,
[02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:31.260]   and it didn't blow up on the launch pad,
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:34.500]   and it's slowly increasing, and it's just crazy,
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:37.180]   and the sound, everything about it.
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:40.140]   And so by the time, the first one specifically,
[02:25:40.140 --> 02:25:45.140]   it was December 2020, was the first SN8.
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:50.300]   It went up, and I actually, we all lost it in the sky.
[02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:53.180]   We couldn't quite see it, but we had telescopes
[02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:56.700]   and high telephoto lenses tracking it,
[02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:58.980]   and what's funny is there's a pretty strong wind
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:02.180]   up there at altitude, and it was moving.
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:05.420]   There's a lot of gaseous oxygen being vented
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:08.500]   out of the rocket, and it's being blown by this air,
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:11.180]   so it looks like it's moving actually quite quickly,
[02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:14.940]   like away from us, like it was strafing to one side.
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:16.140]   So I'm watching the monitor.
[02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:17.820]   I'm going, "Oh my God, they're moving it
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:21.660]   "like over Brownsville," and we're all, all of us,
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:25.420]   everyone on this hotel balcony is looking out down,
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:28.540]   like way out over, and we can't find it,
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:30.300]   and we're like, "Where did they lose it?"
[02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:31.980]   Like we're thinking like, "Oh my God,
[02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:34.660]   "this is gonna crash down in Brownsville."
[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:37.380]   And finally, they shut the engines off,
[02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:39.020]   and we're watching it fall, and again, we're tracking it.
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:41.500]   We know it's falling, and it's falling, falling, falling.
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:42.880]   It's falling super controlled, and we're like,
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:45.460]   "Oh my God, this is perfect," and all of a sudden,
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:48.180]   it clicked, and I see it with my eyes.
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:50.980]   I finally like track it, and it's straight out,
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:53.020]   like straight in front of us, and it looks like
[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:56.220]   it was a blimp, just barely moving,
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:27:00.080]   'cause it is falling slowly, thanks to all of its drag,
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.640]   and again, that's one of those moments I'm like,
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:05.780]   "It's falling so slow," 'cause it's so big.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:06.620]   It's so massive.
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:08.300]   It's falling sideways.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:10.780]   I've seen Falcon 9 boosters and Falcon Heavy boosters,
[02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:11.700]   and they scream.
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:15.180]   They come in so fast, and you can barely even see them.
[02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:16.020]   You can just barely track them,
[02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:16.860]   and all of a sudden, they light their engines,
[02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:18.660]   and they decelerate so quickly.
[02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:19.540]   This was like the opposite.
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.580]   It was like, "Is that thing ever coming down?"
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:25.420]   It was just falling so slowly, and so right there.
[02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.180]   It just felt like it was so close,
[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:29.140]   and so when it finally lit its engine, and it flipped,
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:32.420]   I was losing my mind, 'cause I'm like, "It's working."
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:35.940]   You know, this crazy plan, this huge, massive thing
[02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:39.000]   is doing this absurd feat, and the first one,
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.320]   well, the first four, again, didn't work out as planned,
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:43.120]   but getting to that point already,
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:45.540]   getting to that flip maneuver was a huge milestone,
[02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:49.100]   and it was so exciting just going through those firsts
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:51.660]   were amazing, and I think we're coming up now
[02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:54.100]   on them doing the full stacks of the booster
[02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:55.940]   and the upper stage.
[02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:57.340]   I think when we see that fly,
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:00.260]   when that leaves Earth for the first time,
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:01.980]   it'll be, like I said, almost twice the amount of thrust
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:02.800]   as anything else.
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:05.920]   It'll be the biggest, heaviest, largest thing to ever fly.
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.980]   It's going to shake everything.
[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:11.140]   I can't wait.
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:15.200]   - Have all 33 Raptor engines been active at once?
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.480]   Have they tested that?
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:17.720]   - No, that's coming up.
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:19.240]   That's kind of the next milestone.
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:20.560]   I don't know when this will come out,
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:22.680]   but that's like the next--
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:24.760]   - Just a few days, very quickly here.
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:26.520]   - Then, but if people are listening to this,
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:27.840]   if they're listening to it early on,
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:29.280]   they'll likely be able to catch,
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:31.480]   you know, I think at this point, it seems like next week.
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:33.440]   - So step one would be static fire?
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.480]   - Yep, holding onto the rocket and lighting up the engines,
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:39.360]   and so, so far, they've lit, at most,
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:41.120]   they kind of, they went for like a,
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:42.980]   more than 14 engines static fired.
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.560]   I don't recall if it was like, you know,
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:46.800]   16 or something engines lit at once,
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:50.100]   and they ended up going down to 14 engines.
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:52.460]   That's the most engines they've ever lit.
[02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:55.480]   So the next step, and the final kind of step
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:56.320]   before they fly this thing,
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:57.160]   is they're actually going to light
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.840]   all 33 engines simultaneously.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:02.080]   And although that sounds scary,
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.800]   let's not forget the Falcon Heavy
[02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:06.880]   that's now flown five times completely flawlessly,
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:10.880]   has 27 engines running simultaneously.
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:11.960]   So they definitely have, you know,
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:15.520]   SpaceX has experience with a high number of engines running
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:18.040]   at the same time, but it is still like,
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:20.560]   this is going to be a lot of moving parts
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:24.680]   and a lot of potential and a lot, just a lot of everything.
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:29.680]   - What are the upcoming milestones, expected milestones?
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:32.520]   And I think there's one in particular
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:33.680]   I'd like to talk to you more about,
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:36.200]   but leading up to that, of course, is like,
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:38.320]   what are some of the tests here on the way?
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:40.240]   So is it the static fire,
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:44.140]   the fully stacked with the two stages?
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:48.600]   Will there be, and then all that leading
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:51.920]   to an orbital launch test?
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.760]   So what are the things we should know about?
[02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:56.400]   And what do you think, like,
[02:29:56.400 --> 02:29:58.240]   what do you think the timeline will be
[02:29:58.240 --> 02:29:59.780]   with like the orbital test?
[02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:02.640]   - Timeline, the reason that we have this website,
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:04.520]   the expected milestones, is because I always tell people
[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:07.720]   to ignore any time you ever hear for any of this stuff,
[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:09.160]   just pay attention to milestones,
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:11.840]   because when you're doing stuff for the first time,
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:13.520]   you just have no idea.
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:16.360]   - So just to understand the expected milestones here,
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.080]   the first column is the event,
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:22.400]   the second column is the date and status TBD complete,
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:23.900]   green means what?
[02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:25.600]   - Green means it's been completed
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:27.040]   and it shows the completion date there.
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:28.160]   - And the completion date.
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:32.320]   And then the other is, maybe more, maybe not,
[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:34.320]   for the full stack testing.
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:37.360]   The D-stack and there's a 33 engine.
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:39.960]   - So realistically, we're expecting them to D-stack,
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:41.720]   and SpaceX, I think, just tweeted that, actually,
[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:45.120]   that they're going to be D-stacking the second stage
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:45.960]   from the first stage,
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:48.440]   kind of get the ship safe while they test,
[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:49.720]   because they don't want to, you know,
[02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:51.400]   33 engines is pretty high risk
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:54.080]   if they do blow up the rocket.
[02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:55.040]   When they test it for the first time,
[02:30:55.040 --> 02:30:57.760]   it's not going to be fully fueled, I don't think, at least,
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:30:59.760]   but there is a limit to how,
[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:01.140]   they do have to have it weighed down enough
[02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:03.200]   that the launch clamps can hold onto it,
[02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:04.640]   because if you think about it,
[02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:07.920]   normally the launch clamps are holding onto an entire rocket
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:11.400]   weighing five million kilograms?
[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:14.280]   Five million, you know, it's weighing an insane amount,
[02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:16.440]   so those clamps don't actually have to hold
[02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:18.180]   75 mega newtons of thrust,
[02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:19.400]   they really only have to hold down
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:21.880]   25 mega newtons of thrust, you know what I mean?
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:25.000]   They're not designed to hold down all 75.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.480]   They do have to have enough weight on the rocket,
[02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:30.140]   so even when they do the testing of the 33 engines,
[02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:31.320]   they'll have to have enough propellant in there
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:32.800]   that they don't exceed the clamping
[02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:34.280]   and the holding force of the stand,
[02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:36.840]   otherwise it'll break free from the launch stand
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:39.240]   and that booster will go flying off uncontrolled.
[02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:41.680]   - So it's a difficult thing to figure out in the test
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:45.520]   how many simultaneous things you test, right?
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.080]   - So they're kind of mitigating risks,
[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:48.600]   which is why like, they're destacking,
[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:49.520]   you know, they don't want to have,
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:50.880]   although the ship could be on top of it
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:53.400]   to help weigh it down and simulate the, you know,
[02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:55.160]   the launch environment better,
[02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:57.320]   at some point that's a risk they're just going to take
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:58.680]   when they go for launch,
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:00.320]   and so for now they're taking the ship off
[02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:03.160]   in case something goes wrong during the 33 engine test.
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:05.800]   And then once we see if the 33 engine test goes well,
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:09.160]   hopefully we see the second stage get stacked back on it.
[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:12.060]   We'll see them get closer, like closing out all the items
[02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:15.320]   and hope, the big one too is the FAA launch license.
[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:16.960]   That's a, that'll be publicly filed.
[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:19.560]   We'll see that, you know, in the system,
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:20.520]   having a launch license.
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:23.040]   And I have no sense of that type of thing,
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:24.480]   you know, that's outside of,
[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:26.040]   but that is a big milestone
[02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:28.920]   and it might be something that could potentially hinder,
[02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:30.120]   you know, hold up the launch date,
[02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:32.360]   we'll just be waiting for a launch license.
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:35.080]   - Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of fascinating bureaucracy
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:38.720]   and politics and legal stuff
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.780]   and all that kind of beautiful, magical thing
[02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:42.400]   when you live in reality.
[02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:47.400]   Because it is, I mean, it is a big rocket.
[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:48.560]   - Yeah.
[02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:50.320]   Well, and the biggest thing, it's not so much,
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:51.980]   the FAA doesn't necessarily care
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:53.600]   about the success of the rocket.
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:55.440]   They really just care about the safety
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:58.280]   of public and public property, you know?
[02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:00.960]   So it's a matter of being convinced
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:02.640]   and having the data to prove,
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:05.280]   okay, if this thing blows up,
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.680]   we have a control of how and when it blows up.
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:10.040]   We have control of, you know, X, Y, and Z.
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:12.800]   Here's the potential damage, here's the blast radius.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:16.480]   You know, this again is over twice as powerful
[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:18.240]   and twice as much potential.
[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:20.200]   Actually, it's a lot more potential
[02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:22.840]   for an explosive energy if it, you know,
[02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:24.160]   if it were to happen to,
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:25.960]   well, let me walk back a little bit
[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:27.640]   because in order to have a real detonation,
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:29.040]   you have to have a perfect mixture ratio
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:30.520]   of your fuel and oxidizer.
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:33.240]   When a rocket blows up, typically, you know,
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:35.240]   it kind of unzips and some of the fuel
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:36.640]   will mix into some of the oxidizer
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:39.000]   and you could have some explosive energy.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.240]   But a lot of it's actually just a deflagration.
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:42.720]   It's just, you know, flames.
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:46.000]   And there would be explosive energy,
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.440]   but it's not like you're lighting all of it simultaneously
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:50.240]   and it's this giant bomb.
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:51.080]   It's just really not.
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:53.480]   So that's good, but at the same time,
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:55.520]   even in those circumstances,
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:57.480]   the amount of energy is still absurd.
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:59.360]   Enough to likely blow out windows, you know,
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:03.320]   for miles and miles and miles, including my studio space.
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:08.340]   - Well, if the cameras hold up,
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:11.280]   it would be one heck of a show.
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.720]   Hopefully, of course, would not happen.
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:15.740]   So how does that take us to an orbital launch?
[02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:17.640]   When do you think that would happen?
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:20.600]   - In my opinion, this is a very fluid
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:22.400]   and this will change literally by the hour.
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:24.240]   - So you really think that it's very difficult
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:26.520]   to really say like, even for something
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:28.640]   that could very well happen this year,
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:30.320]   even just a few months away,
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:33.680]   you should make a prediction.
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:35.200]   By the way, are you like superstitious
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:36.520]   on this kind of stuff a little bit?
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:38.240]   Like, you're worried about jinxing it
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:39.440]   and that kind of stuff? - No, not at all.
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:40.280]   No.
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:43.080]   - Because I would imagine you would be like waiting
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:45.940]   for all of these launches that keep getting delayed,
[02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:48.160]   where you start thinking that there's certain things
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:49.480]   you do will control the weather.
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:50.680]   - My socks.
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:51.880]   Why am I wearing these socks?
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:53.640]   Just scrubbed again, you know, like, yeah.
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:54.480]   - You're lucky.
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:55.800]   You have to wear the same lucky socks,
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:59.120]   otherwise there's going to be bad weather.
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:01.160]   So the reason that I say this and why it's so difficult
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:05.880]   is they did a first full stack test in July of 2021.
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:08.160]   And the expectation was we're a month or two away
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:09.520]   from a launch.
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:11.840]   So like, realistically for 18 months,
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:13.840]   I've been in a purgatory thinking that we're a month
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:15.800]   or two away of an orbital launch.
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:19.120]   Now I did say, for the record, when that thing stacked
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:20.960]   and when a lot of speculation was saying,
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.480]   you know, a month or two, I was saying,
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.800]   I don't expect it to fly in 2021.
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:27.040]   You know, and I've been just saying,
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:29.040]   I just saw the amount of work that still needed to be done,
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.960]   like on the ground systems, the tanks, the launch mount,
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.000]   all the stuff I'm sitting there like,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.160]   there's still a lot of stuff.
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.040]   They're gonna have to validate it.
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:37.440]   They're gonna have to test everything, every component.
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:38.800]   And, you know, people were like,
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:40.680]   how dare you say that even Gwen Shotwell,
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:43.480]   the president of SpaceX is saying Q3 of 2021.
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:46.440]   I'm like, okay, but like, I'm just,
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:49.080]   I'm not going to be surprised if it slips into 2022.
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:51.240]   And here we are at the beginning of 2023.
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:55.120]   And I think we're finally within like two months.
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:57.680]   I'm expecting, like I'm trying to keep my March
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:35:59.040]   and April as free as I can.
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:01.840]   We'll put it that way.
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:03.400]   - I love it.
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:06.200]   Actually, just in a small tangent on Gwen Shotwell,
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:10.560]   like what do you, from everything I know,
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:12.920]   she's an instrumental, a really crucial person
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:15.800]   to the success of SpaceX in running the show.
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:18.000]   She's the president, the COO.
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:23.840]   What do you know about her that sort of,
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:26.320]   the genius of Gwen Shotwell?
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.120]   - Man, my understanding is she's really the glue.
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:31.120]   You know, she's the glue to the tornado.
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:34.840]   Tornado comes in and then she comes around
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:39.560]   and just really executes on, and helps, you know,
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:43.400]   a famous story is that at some point Elon walked in
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:45.200]   or she sprinted into a meeting
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:48.440]   because Elon was actively trying to cancel Falcon Heavy,
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:51.040]   saying it's too far, like it's too much development,
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:51.880]   it's still too far away.
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.480]   And this is like, you know,
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:55.400]   this might've been like end of 2017 or something.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:56.920]   And it flew for the first time in 2018.
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:00.160]   So we're talking like it's close to the end of development.
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.080]   You know, there's hardware being built, all this stuff.
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.400]   And Elon's literally in a meeting telling people
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:06.920]   they're gonna cancel it and we're gonna move on to BFR,
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:10.240]   or now Starship, and just go full steam ahead on that.
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:12.480]   And she runs into the meeting and reminds Elon,
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:15.000]   we have X amount of customers
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.440]   have already purchased a ride on Falcon Heavy.
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:19.000]   We can't delay that.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.240]   You know, so it's that business sense of like,
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:23.480]   yes, it's great to innovate,
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:25.000]   but we also have to pay our dues
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.120]   and make the money to continue our operations.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:30.640]   And I think she's just a lot better at,
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:33.480]   she has, I think she has such a great perspective
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:34.320]   on everything.
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:36.760]   It really seems like everything, she doesn't,
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:37.840]   I wish she did more interviews
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:40.160]   'cause I would love to hear more from her.
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:41.640]   But man, like it just seems--
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:42.640]   - Hear that, Gwen?
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:43.480]   (laughing)
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:44.520]   - For both of us.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:47.080]   - Yeah, she hasn't actually done that many interviews, right?
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:47.920]   - Not really, no.
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:49.360]   She's done like a TED Talk,
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:51.000]   a couple of little things here and there,
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.560]   but not really many interviews.
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:55.640]   And I would just love to hear like what,
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:57.360]   you know, what on a daily basis,
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:00.640]   like what is she doing to keep her head on
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:02.520]   and keep everything so organized?
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:05.200]   You know, it's, you know, yeah.
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:08.680]   My understanding is that she is absolutely integral
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:11.720]   and does just an insane amount of work at SpaceX.
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:14.440]   - Yeah, I mean, so it's the project planning,
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:17.400]   but also the, how the teams integrate together
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:20.640]   and the hiring and just the management of the whole thing.
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:22.000]   - I think it's a lot of it, honestly,
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:22.840]   even just the business,
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:25.040]   making sure the money's flowing
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:26.920]   in a positive trend, more or less, you know?
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:28.880]   That, yes, Elon's obviously a money guy,
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:32.440]   but he thinks, he's so, I think Elon is so risky.
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:34.720]   You know, he just loves to throw it all in
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:37.080]   that he leaves little margin for error.
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:40.120]   You know, he's been really lucky with rolling his dice,
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:43.320]   you know, especially like when he started SpaceX and Tesla.
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.640]   That was the ultimate roll of the dice.
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:48.160]   But I think she's a healthy balance to be like,
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:50.920]   well, here's our, you know, operations
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:53.160]   and now we can continue to do this
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:54.520]   without risking everything, you know?
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.960]   And Starship's close, let me be clear.
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:59.520]   Starship is close to risking everything already.
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:02.080]   It's just such a big, fast-moving,
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:04.200]   high-risk developmental program that like,
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:07.800]   I personally think, you know, SpaceX would probably be fine
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:09.480]   if they shut the doors on Starship
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:11.160]   and just flew Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:12.200]   for the next 10 years,
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.600]   they would still be commercially valid.
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:15.360]   They could not spend another dollar
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:16.200]   on research and development.
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:18.080]   They could fire, I don't want them to,
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:20.520]   fire everyone involved in anything research and development
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:22.840]   and just ran operations on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:25.040]   and they would still be dominant for 10 years.
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:26.400]   And they would still have a business case
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:27.960]   and they'd still be fine.
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:32.040]   But they're all in, like all chips are pretty much,
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:35.160]   as many chips as possible are in for Starship.
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:40.160]   - And this, I don't know what else I could say.
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:45.080]   I've talked to a lot of great leaders.
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:46.720]   There's just not many people like Elon
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:48.220]   that would push for Starship.
[02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:51.440]   - When they're already as far ahead.
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:53.000]   - A very successful company.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.960]   Sort of everyone doubted
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:57.480]   that it could be a successful company.
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:00.120]   It was so close to bankruptcy and failing.
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:03.080]   And then to take it into a financially viable,
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:06.120]   successful company, and just when you do,
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.020]   you take on a project that again risks everything.
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:13.480]   - Well, he already did this with Falcon 1 to Falcon 9.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:16.420]   Like literally people were like, what are you doing?
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:17.860]   They basically signed over
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:20.440]   and were fully ramping up Falcon 9
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:23.360]   by the time they finally had their first Falcon 1 success.
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:24.400]   They had one more flight.
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.640]   They only flew Falcon 1 successfully twice.
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:27.720]   They flew it five times altogether.
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:30.020]   The fourth one was successful and they flew one more time.
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:33.020]   And anyone else out there would have been like,
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:34.960]   let's keep flying the Falcon 1.
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:36.720]   We have a working rocket.
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:39.640]   We can start making money and profiting.
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:42.400]   And already he was risking it all and saying, nope,
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.240]   we're going from Falcon 1 to Falcon 9
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:47.000]   was a huge, huge leap.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.240]   I think it's at least as big as a leap from Falcon 1 to 9
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:52.720]   as it is from Falcon 9 to Starship
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.480]   or around relatively a similar leap.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:56.800]   So it's just that same thing again.
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:58.640]   People are going, why are you leaping
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.180]   into this insane program and system and risk
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:06.600]   when you finally have this workhorse of a rocket
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:09.200]   that's so dominant in the industry,
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.600]   yet they're going 10X.
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:15.800]   - It so happens that you've been selected
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:19.220]   for the Dear Moon mission that will fly Starship
[02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:22.300]   once around the moon with nine people on board.
[02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:25.360]   You are one of those people.
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:29.600]   So just pause to take that in.
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:34.160]   Everything that we've been talking about,
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:36.000]   you will not just be reporting on,
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.500]   you will be a part of it.
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:41.400]   So tell me about the objective of this mission
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:43.780]   and how does it feel to be a part of it?
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:46.400]   - Well.
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:50.600]   Man.
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:57.240]   Yeah, it's basically, it's the Willy Wonka of space.
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:02.100]   Like a generous, a generous individual
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:06.440]   purchased a ride from SpaceX as early,
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:09.040]   at least as far as I know, the earliest I knew about it
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:11.120]   was February 27th, 2017.
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:12.520]   - Who's the individual?
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:13.920]   - Yusaku Maezawa, but at the time,
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:16.320]   I'm telling a story at the time we didn't know.
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:17.880]   Okay, great.
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:20.500]   So February 27th, 2017, a press release comes out
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:24.320]   from SpaceX saying someone purchased a ride
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:26.680]   through us around the moon.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:27.840]   We're gonna fly someone around the moon.
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:29.400]   And at the time it was on a Crew Dragon capsule
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:30.880]   and a Falcon Heavy.
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:31.800]   It's like, wow.
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:32.840]   And that was enough.
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:34.960]   That little moment right there, that press release.
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:36.140]   It's the first time I'm like,
[02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:37.960]   I'm gonna make a YouTube video about this.
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.200]   And I stood up, turned on my camera,
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:42.720]   put on my, at the time, space suit.
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:45.480]   And I basically yelled at the camera for three minutes
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:47.520]   about someone's going around the moon.
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:52.080]   Fast forward to 2018, end of 2018 or near the end,
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:54.960]   they introduced, there was a SpaceX press conference.
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:57.740]   I'm there as a member of the press.
[02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:00.320]   I'm reporting on, we're going to meet this person
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:01.720]   that's going around the moon
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:03.000]   and come to find out, boom,
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.820]   they're going to be riding on Starship now.
[02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:06.680]   They changed from Falcon Heavy and Dragon.
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:08.040]   SpaceX is no longer going to do that.
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:10.460]   They're going to upgrade them basically to Starship.
[02:43:10.460 --> 02:43:12.720]   So instead of being in like a small tin can,
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:14.840]   they're in this giant, luxurious,
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:17.540]   mega rocket around the moon.
[02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:20.280]   And it comes out that this individual named Yusaku Maezawa,
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:24.640]   who is a Japanese billionaire, purchased this ride.
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:28.360]   And instead of inviting his friends and colleagues
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:31.280]   and whatever, whoever's family members or whatever,
[02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:34.040]   he decided that the most impactful thing he could do
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:38.620]   with this opportunity is invite more or less artists.
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:40.360]   And the original thing was like artists,
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:43.500]   journalists, a painter, an athlete,
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:48.560]   photographer, videographer, all walks of life basically.
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:50.400]   - When they said athlete, they thought of you.
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:51.240]   (laughing)
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:53.400]   - They're like, I know a guy.
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:55.080]   This guy rode rag by once.
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:57.320]   (laughing)
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.000]   And at the time, I was like, this is crazy.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.200]   I can't believe this is gonna happen.
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:05.580]   And he had this vision of we're gonna find people
[02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:06.420]   from all around the world.
[02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:08.840]   I'm going to invite people from all around the world,
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:12.200]   from different walks of life, different trades.
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:14.040]   And I'm going to share this experience
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:15.560]   so that they can share it with the world
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.220]   and really have an impact much greater than any one country
[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:23.800]   or any one individual or any set of military trained
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.400]   astronauts could do, offer up a new perspective.
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:28.240]   Beautiful.
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:30.280]   Literally, I mean, at the press conference, I cried.
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:31.600]   Like I had a couple of tears in my eyes.
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:32.800]   I was like, this is so cool.
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:33.960]   - We could just pause on that.
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:35.560]   So he goes by MZ.
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:36.400]   - MZ, yep.
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:39.080]   - How incredible is that?
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:43.240]   - It's, I'd like, I think it's,
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:47.240]   you often don't realize the importance of individuals
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:48.180]   in human history.
[02:44:48.180 --> 02:44:51.240]   Like they define because this could be,
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:54.160]   we talked about the importance of Elon in particular.
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:57.120]   Most of the work is done by large groups of people
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:59.760]   that are collective intelligence that we band together.
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:04.440]   But like these individuals can be the spark
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:07.400]   of the catalyst of that progress.
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:12.400]   And I mean, just this idea of getting not just civilians,
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:14.000]   which is already incredible,
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.840]   but civilians with a sort of an artistic flame
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:19.480]   that burns inside them, they're able to communicate.
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:22.040]   Whatever they do, are able to communicate something
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:23.360]   about that experience.
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.040]   And it's just a genius idea to spend quite probably
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.360]   a very large amount of money for that.
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.280]   I mean, it's, and that will be part of history.
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:39.360]   - Yeah, and it's easy these days for people to be cynical,
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:43.620]   especially about like space flight and wealthy individuals.
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:47.440]   But really, in my opinion, and maybe just the time
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:50.280]   I was just so couldn't believe this idea,
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:55.040]   I'm someone that has studied a lot about the Apollo program,
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:56.160]   the people that have been to the moon,
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:59.120]   and they're incredible individuals, incredible individuals,
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:01.720]   but they're so saturated with tasks,
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:04.680]   and they're military trained and often,
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:06.680]   that they didn't really have the luxury
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:09.160]   of just being able to soak in the experience
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:12.720]   of going around or to the moon
[02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:14.700]   and seeing the moon up close with your own eyes.
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:19.200]   Like that just psychologically has to be insane.
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:23.080]   And so to have this opportunity to be able to observe
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:26.040]   our closest celestial neighbor with your own eyes
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:28.760]   and your sole purpose is to soak it in and share it
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:32.360]   and communicate and create with the rest of our planet,
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:34.860]   like that to me is just beautiful.
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:39.680]   - So that is the objective of the mission.
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:41.720]   - That right there is the objective of the mission.
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:45.680]   - And how does it feel to be selected
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:48.080]   as one of the nine to do it?
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.720]   - It's a gradient.
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:53.640]   It's slowly, it's doing a few things.
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:55.420]   Since I've known it's become,
[02:46:55.420 --> 02:46:58.960]   I think the closer it gets, the more excited
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:00.360]   and the more nervous I get.
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:02.840]   - And the more real it becomes.
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:04.120]   - The more real it becomes.
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:05.720]   The announcement was a big,
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:08.880]   it just got announced at the end of 2022 publicly,
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:09.720]   who's involved.
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.520]   And so prior to that, I had each step
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:14.720]   of the selection process,
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:17.400]   there's a pretty comprehensive selection process
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:18.680]   with interviews and stuff.
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:20.960]   Each step, I'd try not to get my hopes up.
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.720]   And frankly, let me be clear,
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:25.640]   this was not something that I've always wanted to do.
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:26.800]   It's not like I'm out there,
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:28.280]   I didn't start doing YouTube videos
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:29.560]   'cause I wanted to even go to space,
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:30.960]   like none of that.
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:33.520]   And I've said, hilariously, I've probably said
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.680]   dozens or hundreds of times on air,
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:37.040]   yeah, I don't ever wanna go to space.
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:38.980]   'Cause it's not a driving force.
[02:47:38.980 --> 02:47:41.240]   It's not really a thing I even really truly pictured
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:43.960]   or let myself fantasize about, frankly.
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:46.120]   So each step of the selection process,
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:49.360]   I didn't really let myself dream about it too much
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:51.680]   or it would kinda chip away,
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:54.000]   like, oh my God, this is actually becoming more real.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.400]   This is actually more and more of an opportunity.
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:57.600]   And I get equally more nervous too.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:02.600]   Like, frankly, I've seen space flight stuff go wrong.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:06.000]   I think about this stuff a lot.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.880]   So like, yeah, I get more nervous,
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:09.720]   but I also get more excited about that opportunity.
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:12.040]   Like it's an opportunity that how can you pass?
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.080]   And I still have to actually stop, pause, think,
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:18.320]   and actually realize the reality
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.200]   that I am going to the moon,
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.680]   I'm going to see the moon up close,
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:24.520]   flying around the moon.
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:26.800]   I'm sorry, some people get mad when I say going to the moon
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:28.200]   since I'm not landing on it.
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:30.280]   But flying around the moon,
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:32.400]   seeing the far side of the moon with my own eyes
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:36.360]   and seeing the earth rise behind it.
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:38.120]   Yeah, it's going to, I just,
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.320]   I can't tell you what it's going to be like and feel like.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:42.720]   - It's so epic.
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:43.920]   - But it's insane to me
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:45.560]   that like we're having this conversation
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:48.360]   and that that is my reality, you know?
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:49.920]   And that someone was generous enough
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:52.200]   to consider the option of sharing this
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:55.160]   with frankly strangers.
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:58.240]   And the process that they had for selecting,
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:01.600]   like how much thought and time
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:03.720]   went into the selection process is incredible.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:07.240]   You know, they did a public call at the beginning of 2021.
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:10.320]   And so the teams involved in whittling it down
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.680]   from a million applicants,
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:13.920]   there's a million applicants that whittled it,
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:17.280]   and they got it down to eight crew members and two backups.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:19.880]   Amazing people.
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:21.560]   I would have, you know,
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:23.480]   I don't know how they wound up where they did,
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:24.800]   but it's incredible.
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:26.480]   I feel very deep connection
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:28.760]   to everyone that's already involved.
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:30.120]   - What can you say about the crew?
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:32.200]   You've gotten the chance to meet them and talk to them.
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:34.200]   I know Steve Aoki is on the crew.
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:36.600]   Like, who else is there?
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:39.840]   So you are obviously the star athlete.
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.880]   Who else, in terms of the artists that are there?
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:45.000]   - So, oh man, we might just want to pull up,
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.360]   just so I don't totally butcher and forget anybody.
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:49.640]   But because so far I haven't actually had the chance
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:50.720]   to meet everyone in person.
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:53.640]   You know, so far a lot of this was done during the pandemic,
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:55.400]   but we've met through a couple of different things.
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:57.880]   We've had a couple of different times to get together.
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:01.600]   But so, so far I've not met Steve Aoki yet or Top.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.200]   We've been on calls and stuff.
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:07.160]   I also have not yet met Dev Joshi,
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:09.000]   who is an actor from India.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.880]   So yeah, Steve Aoki, American DJ and producer and musician.
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:18.880]   Top from South Korea is also a musician and a producer.
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:20.120]   - So this is all across the world.
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:23.760]   So like truly global, all different kinds of walks of life.
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:24.600]   - Yes. - All artists
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:25.600]   of different forms.
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:28.240]   - And Steve is Japanese.
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:29.160]   His parents are Japanese,
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:32.160]   but he, you know, born and raised in the United States.
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:36.880]   Yemi is a dancer and choreographer from the Czech Republic.
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:39.840]   Rhiannon is a fine art photographer from, well,
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:41.160]   England and Ireland.
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:44.000]   I guess she lives in both and kind of a bit of a,
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.480]   she's all over the place.
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:47.120]   Technically she's Irish, I guess.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:51.320]   Tim Dodd, yep, that's me, from the United States.
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:54.880]   Then you have Kareem, who is from England
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:58.560]   and does also as a photographer and documentarian.
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:02.720]   Does a lot of work with oceanography and volcanoes.
[02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:04.840]   So he does really incredible work.
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:08.360]   Brendan Hall is a documentarian and filmmaker.
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:11.640]   Dev Joshi, sorry, Brendan is also from the United States.
[02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:15.160]   Dev Joshi is an Indian actor.
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:18.120]   I believe also, I believe he's also already been producing
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:19.120]   and things, he's very young.
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:21.280]   I think he's only like 19 or 20.
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.760]   And he's, I mean, he's been acting since he was like
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:24.840]   five years old or something.
[02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:26.720]   He's a Bollywood star.
[02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:29.200]   Like he is a star in India, which is really cool.
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:30.240]   - Right.
[02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:31.840]   - Caitlin Farrington from the United States
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:35.800]   is an Olympic gold medalist snowboarder.
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:38.920]   So she, believe it or not, is the athlete and not me.
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:39.760]   - Oh, all right.
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:40.600]   (laughing)
[02:51:40.600 --> 02:51:43.120]   - And then, and she's one of the back up crew members,
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:47.120]   as so is Miyu from Japan, who's a dancer.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:47.960]   - That's amazing.
[02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:49.560]   I mean, it's such an interesting group.
[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:52.640]   I mean, is there something else you could say about MZ?
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:53.480]   About Yusaku Maezawa?
[02:51:53.480 --> 02:51:54.840]   - Yeah, Yusaku Maezawa.
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:57.560]   So he's also a musician.
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:51:59.560]   So he was actually in like some kind of punk,
[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:01.360]   hardcore Japanese bands in the early,
[02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:03.720]   in the '90s and stuff, in the early 2000s.
[02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:08.720]   He started a record company and distribution and sales
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:13.520]   ended up in fashion and owns one of the biggest
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:15.280]   fashion companies in Japan.
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:17.160]   And has become a fine art collector
[02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:19.120]   and just kind of a philanthropist.
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:20.760]   - And he's been out to space already.
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:22.680]   - He's already not only been to space,
[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:25.360]   like he's been to the International Space Station.
[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:27.360]   He's been on orbit and on the ISS.
[02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:30.080]   And so he, what's cool is like,
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:33.520]   there's talks of, frankly, to be honest,
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:34.400]   we still don't, I still don't know
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:35.840]   all of the details about this.
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:38.040]   We're not yet into training.
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:39.520]   I kind of always assumed prior
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:41.320]   that there'd be some professional astronaut,
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:42.560]   when they talked about in 2018,
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:44.720]   there's talks of we'll have a professional astronaut
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:47.120]   on board, but realistically now,
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:50.400]   like MZ is a trained astronaut.
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:54.880]   He has trained a lot, like six months plus
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:56.680]   to be able to fly on Soyuz.
[02:52:56.680 --> 02:52:59.160]   So as far as like, it's good to know for me
[02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.520]   that I have someone on the crew
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:04.080]   that has experience with spaceflight,
[02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:06.760]   has trained and has some knowledge on spaceflight as well.
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:08.960]   You know, that is an important aspect for sure.
[02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:10.400]   - So you made an excellent video
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:12.880]   about flying in a fighter jet
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:16.760]   that I think you mentioned may be relevant to the training.
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:19.400]   Is there some high level aspects to training
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:22.360]   that you anticipate that you might be able to speak to?
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:24.880]   - Yeah, so, you know, so far I think we can really lean
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:28.240]   on what has happened with the other, you know,
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:31.400]   commercial crew missions and in private missions
[02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:33.760]   like the Inspiration4 mission or Axiom
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:35.320]   where SpaceX flew individuals.
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:37.160]   They trained for about six months,
[02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:41.000]   a lot of like reading manuals and learning the spacecraft.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.900]   - Are you gonna do like a Rocky IV montage or?
[02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:46.000]   - I hope I just get shredded.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.320]   I hope it's physical, a lot of physical training.
[02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:50.320]   - And they're like, we didn't tell him to do it.
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:55.160]   He just seems to wanna fill himself shirtless in the snow.
[02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:56.000]   Doesn't make any, how is this relevant?
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.240]   - Punching meat, why is he always doing this?
[02:53:58.240 --> 02:54:00.040]   Can't get him to stop punching meat.
[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:04.560]   So yeah, hopefully, realistically.
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:08.600]   - That's a manual reading, I like it.
[02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:10.880]   But there's a physical component to all of this
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:13.840]   and that's really, I mean, that's fascinating.
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:17.400]   It's also inspiring the sort of civilians can do this.
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:18.920]   That's really interesting.
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:22.160]   - Yeah, I mean, this is, and to me this represents,
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:24.840]   this and the other commercial space, you know,
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:26.080]   private spaceflight missions like this
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:29.360]   represent really a turning point, like truly an inflection.
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:30.980]   And again, it's easy for people to be cynical
[02:54:30.980 --> 02:54:34.720]   that, oh, you know, why are people wasting all this money
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:35.680]   doing spaceflight stuff?
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:37.680]   It's like, well, I'm sure some people
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:40.160]   were saying that same thing about airplanes
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:43.560]   and early aviation, going like, why are we,
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:45.520]   can't believe those people are wasting the government's,
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:48.120]   you know, funding these stupid planes and stuff.
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:49.240]   How's this ever gonna benefit me?
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:50.960]   And nowadays, like imagine if all the planes
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:52.520]   just stopped working.
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:55.440]   Like we'd freak out, it's like our economy would collapse.
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:56.680]   It would suck, you know?
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:59.880]   And it might be a long time before we get to that reality
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:00.720]   with spaceflight.
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:04.040]   But no, if spaceflight halted today, you know,
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.520]   space assets, all of our, you know, on-orbit assets,
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.240]   our life would be crippled.
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:11.160]   And I don't think people realize that.
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:13.240]   So it's already, we're already reliant on it.
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:14.760]   But now we're getting to the point where it's,
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:16.040]   we're really turning that corner
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:19.280]   where it's the average person alive today.
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:22.680]   You know, if you're born, you know, now, from now on,
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:25.160]   I think there's a real decent chance that by the time
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:28.840]   you pass, there's an opportunity to have flown in space.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:31.320]   - Yeah, I mean, I, if I'm being honest,
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:33.960]   I still haven't lost the feeling of magic
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:35.600]   of flying in an airplane.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:38.940]   I often catch myself thinking like, how is this real?
[02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:44.880]   How is, and like the contrast of this incredible thing
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:48.480]   that's incredibly safe, flying through the air,
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:51.480]   taking off and landing, while everyone else
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.400]   just looks bored, watching like, I don't know,
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:01.400]   some romantic comedy on their phone with wifi.
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:02.280]   - Yeah.
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:06.680]   - So it's just, it's like, the contrast of that is like,
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:11.480]   wow, we're incredible, we're incredible as a society.
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.880]   And it's like, we develop some amazing technology
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:19.760]   that improves almost immeasurably our quality of life,
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:21.320]   and then we take it for granted,
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:23.760]   and now still reach for the next thing.
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:26.680]   And the next thing in life becomes more beautiful
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:28.000]   and complex and interesting.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.040]   And yeah, it's just, the same stuff will be happening
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:34.560]   with space travel.
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:37.320]   - Oh, it'll become mundane and boring at some point.
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:39.720]   - The tough thing about space travel, of course,
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:43.520]   you know, I don't even know if it's such a giant leap
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.480]   over airplanes, because airplanes are already incredible.
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:50.560]   But the tough thing with space travel is the destination,
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:54.880]   right, is the landing on whole other worlds,
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:58.000]   whether it's docking with different transport vehicles
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.800]   or the space station, or it's landing elsewhere.
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:03.440]   And it really is incredible.
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.360]   I think you mentioned, since there's artists,
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:11.320]   there's filmmakers and so on, and you're all of those,
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:14.720]   on top of being a great athlete.
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:17.880]   I don't know, I'll just stop the running joke at this point.
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:22.880]   But is there, have you thought about, just in general,
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:25.000]   we've offline talked about microphones
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.640]   and all the different ways to film space launch,
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:31.320]   yeah, rocket launches.
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:33.000]   Have you thought about the different options
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.760]   of how to capture this?
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:39.920]   Have you, have the team, have been brainstorming
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:41.160]   and thinking about this?
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:43.640]   Do you anticipate it being super challenging?
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:44.800]   'Cause there's so many opportunities
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:47.640]   to sort of think of how to do this.
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:49.360]   - So one of the fun things to remember
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:52.120]   is that Starship is huge.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:54.480]   Like its internal volume is,
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:55.760]   the pressurized volume on Starship
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:59.000]   is bigger than a 747's pressurized volume.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:02.400]   And it can take 100 metric tons to anywhere
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.040]   with enough refueling.
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:07.440]   So we have, in theory, very little mass
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:08.880]   and volume constraints.
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:12.040]   Unlike prior, all other space flight missions ever,
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:15.960]   you're counting grams down to,
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:18.640]   and just really can't risk,
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:21.520]   you have very defined parameters
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:23.560]   on what you can and cannot do.
[02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:25.640]   We're going to likely have the luxury
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:27.080]   of being able to film and capture this
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:29.000]   in a way that's just never been done before.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:32.320]   We won't be inhibited by mass
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:34.720]   and volume constraints like prior.
[02:58:34.720 --> 02:58:37.400]   So all that said and done,
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:39.720]   I'm hoping that we'll be able to just
[02:58:39.720 --> 02:58:40.840]   arm ourselves to the teeth
[02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:44.520]   with the absolute best cameras and equipment possible,
[02:58:44.520 --> 02:58:48.080]   backups on backups, and pre-wire,
[02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:49.760]   like pre-rig things.
[02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:52.960]   Starship is going to be a transportation system
[02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:56.320]   and it has, it's being built from the ground up.
[02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:58.440]   There's no reason why they can't
[02:58:58.440 --> 02:58:59.960]   put infrastructure in for cameras
[02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:01.720]   that are just housed in the vehicle.
[02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:04.720]   These are talks that I'm excited to have.
[02:59:04.720 --> 02:59:06.160]   'Cause I really, ideally,
[02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:07.960]   one of the things I'd love to do,
[02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:09.120]   I'm going to be pushing really hard
[02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:11.240]   to actually try live streaming
[02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:13.880]   from inside during the launch.
[02:59:14.800 --> 02:59:17.640]   - During the launch, live stream from the inside.
[02:59:17.640 --> 02:59:18.720]   That would be incredible.
[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:20.000]   - Wouldn't that be?
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.480]   - If that's possible to pull off,
[02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:23.880]   that's really, really incredible.
[02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:25.640]   There is the magic to the live stream
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:27.800]   because like that's real, that's right there.
[02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:29.880]   That would, the world would tune in.
[02:59:29.880 --> 02:59:31.960]   That would be truly inspiring, yes.
[02:59:31.960 --> 02:59:33.800]   - To me, that's one of those things,
[02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:36.040]   a lot of people ask why they aren't doing it.
[02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:37.840]   Of course, NASA and other individuals
[02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:39.680]   will have their reasons of why not.
[02:59:39.680 --> 02:59:41.360]   You know, there's obviously some technical hurdles,
[02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:44.440]   but now with Starlink and other capabilities,
[02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:46.480]   there's less hurdles.
[02:59:46.480 --> 02:59:48.760]   There's obviously some transparency reasons why,
[02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:50.000]   you know, and safety reasons
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:51.560]   why it might not be a great idea
[02:59:51.560 --> 02:59:54.680]   to live stream a risky rocket launch.
[02:59:54.680 --> 02:59:55.600]   You know, the Challenger, I think,
[02:59:55.600 --> 02:59:57.760]   put a pretty bad taste in our mouth
[02:59:57.760 --> 02:59:59.880]   as far as publicizing an event
[02:59:59.880 --> 03:00:02.360]   and having every student in the United States
[03:00:02.360 --> 03:00:05.800]   tune in to, you know, a tragedy.
[03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:08.400]   But that's something I'm pushing for really hard
[03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:10.280]   just because I think it could be magical.
[03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:12.000]   I think it could really connect with people
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.720]   in a way that hasn't been done before.
[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:16.120]   - Speaking of Challenger,
[03:00:16.120 --> 03:00:22.080]   have you thought about the fact that you're riding
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:24.920]   a thing, as we've been talking about,
[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:29.920]   that's a giant, explosive, powerful rocket?
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:36.200]   Have you thought about the risk of that,
[03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:37.880]   the danger of that?
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:41.080]   Have you contemplated your own mortality?
[03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:42.280]   - How could I not?
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:45.800]   You know, I've seen and felt
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:48.240]   four of these prototype vehicles blow up,
[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:49.880]   you know, with my own eyes.
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:53.880]   I don't know if there's anyone else,
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:56.600]   you know, early days, some of the, you know,
[03:00:56.600 --> 03:01:00.760]   Mercury and Gemini astronauts watched failures of rockets
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:02.600]   and then got on them.
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:03.560]   I don't know of too many people
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:04.960]   that are dumb enough to do that, though,
[03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:06.640]   these days, this day and age.
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:11.240]   It's obviously, I will have to see
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:12.880]   a lot of successful launches
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:15.400]   and have to have a lot of confidence
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:18.000]   in the engineering, the data,
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.520]   that they've developed a safe system.
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:22.760]   'Cause currently, the current iteration of Starship
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:26.640]   has no abort system, has no escape tower.
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:28.560]   So, you know, Dragon Capsule,
[03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:29.760]   which is currently flying people,
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:31.360]   has a launch abort system.
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.600]   It has Super Draco engines that,
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:34.600]   either by the push of a button
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:37.040]   or by the automatic triggering of the flight computer,
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:40.880]   can shoot the capsule off of the rocket in milliseconds
[03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:43.200]   and pull it safely away, get it far enough away
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:46.040]   that it can pull the parachutes and safely splash down.
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:50.080]   Starship, by all iterations I've ever seen,
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:52.200]   does not have that.
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:53.720]   The Space Shuttle also did not have that.
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:56.360]   So it's not absurd to not have an abort system.
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:01:59.760]   Like, it is, there is, you know,
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:02.160]   certain engineering principles that prove
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:04.200]   that that could be a completely valid thing.
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:07.320]   You know, the Space Shuttle flew 133 times
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:08.280]   fully successfully.
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:09.680]   It did have two failures,
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:11.400]   resulting in the loss of 14 lives.
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:16.480]   85, or sorry, 98.5% success rate.
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:19.160]   Pretty, I mean, yeah.
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:22.200]   I've probably done things that are a lot riskier.
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:24.680]   I have raced motorcycles, drag raced motorcycles,
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:26.480]   and, you know, ridden like an absolute jerk
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:27.640]   on the streets on a motorcycle.
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:31.960]   I'm sure I've had a higher than a 98.5% survival rate,
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:34.120]   or lower than that, I mean, at some point.
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:39.880]   So it's, you know, yes, it's risky, it's scary.
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:43.280]   And I think about it a lot, a lot.
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:46.320]   It definitely is one of those things that I, you know,
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:47.760]   I will have to see.
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:50.520]   And I'm in no hurry for this to happen either.
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:52.120]   You know, personally, I'm in no hurry,
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:54.760]   because it's like, I would rather see this thing
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:57.840]   be developed and iterated and see 10, you know,
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:02:59.640]   or I was gonna say 10 dozen,
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:02.480]   but I'd be happy with a dozen fully successful,
[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:05.440]   like, oh, we've got this thing totally nailed down,
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:07.720]   you know, before I get on it.
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:09.920]   But, and that likely is the reality.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:12.400]   There will likely be a dozen or two or three launches,
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:14.280]   because just even to get to the moon on Starship,
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:16.260]   they have to refuel it in orbit.
[03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:20.120]   So it will get to Earth orbit basically empty
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:20.960]   and out of fuel.
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:23.600]   So I'll have to dock with a fuel depot,
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:25.760]   fill up, and then go to the moon.
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:28.600]   So just to even get that full, you know,
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:30.600]   we're already talking about, you know,
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:31.640]   a handful of launches.
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:34.880]   So there will be a lot of launches before we fly.
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:39.120]   - Would they do a test flight without humans on board
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:40.920]   that goes to the moon, or no?
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:41.760]   - I'm not sure.
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:43.620]   I'm not sure if they'll do that exact flight profile,
[03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:45.760]   but by then they will have already flown,
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:48.200]   most likely the Artemis III program
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:51.800]   will have flown a Starship variant to the moon
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:53.000]   that lands on the moon.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:57.140]   So doing, at that point, you're pretty much,
[03:03:57.140 --> 03:03:58.840]   I would like them to test the heat shield
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:00.000]   at that entry velocity, though,
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.000]   'cause it is, you know, it takes another,
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.640]   it's about 30% faster to get,
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:08.320]   like, you have to go 30% faster than the low Earth orbit
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:10.360]   to get out to a translunar injection.
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:12.920]   And although that only sounds like, oh, it's 30% faster,
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:15.680]   it's, you know, the reentry heating
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:19.480]   experienced by a vehicle goes up by velocity cubed,
[03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:21.680]   not squared, so, and not even, not linear.
[03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:22.840]   So it's not like if you go twice as fast,
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:24.280]   you get, you see twice as much heat,
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:26.600]   you know, 30% faster, 30% more heat.
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:27.920]   It's, and it's not squared.
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:30.320]   It's not go twice as fast, get four times as much heat.
[03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:32.520]   It's go twice as fast, get eight times
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:34.840]   as much heat on reentry.
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:37.280]   So 30% faster on reentry is actually
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:38.760]   a really, really big deal.
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:41.880]   So I would love to see that be tested.
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:42.720]   You know, there's certain things
[03:04:42.720 --> 03:04:43.680]   that I would love to see milestones
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:44.860]   that I would love to see tested out
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:47.180]   and proven before I get on board.
[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:50.520]   But at the end of the day, I really do believe
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:52.920]   that just like Falcon 9 and the success of that,
[03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:56.960]   that they're going to push it and get all the kinks out
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:58.480]   well before anyone's on top of it.
[03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:00.640]   Nowadays, Falcon 9 and Dragon is, you know,
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:04.480]   arguably the, one of the safest, most reliable
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:07.080]   and best rides you could take to space.
[03:05:07.080 --> 03:05:09.220]   - Are you afraid of dying?
[03:05:09.220 --> 03:05:11.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:14.320]   - Is this one of the first times you get to, you're young.
[03:05:14.320 --> 03:05:15.140]   - Yeah.
[03:05:15.140 --> 03:05:17.000]   - Have you gotten a chance to think about death
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:21.760]   as one of the first times you've really contemplated it?
[03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:23.700]   - I mean, yeah.
[03:05:23.700 --> 03:05:28.660]   I mean, like I said, I've had dumb moments on motorcycles
[03:05:28.660 --> 03:05:30.820]   where I kind of saw, you know, like,
[03:05:30.820 --> 03:05:34.460]   I am going to smash into this thing at 120 mile an hour.
[03:05:34.460 --> 03:05:36.180]   - So you've had moments when you realized
[03:05:36.180 --> 03:05:37.380]   it could end just like this.
[03:05:37.380 --> 03:05:38.220]   - Yes.
[03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:40.500]   - Where you literally, and I have,
[03:05:40.500 --> 03:05:45.420]   for most of my adult life, had dreams of falling
[03:05:45.420 --> 03:05:47.660]   and hitting the ground and it just all,
[03:05:47.660 --> 03:05:49.340]   you get a ring in your ears, it all goes black.
[03:05:49.340 --> 03:05:51.460]   And in my head, I go, oh shit, that was it.
[03:05:51.460 --> 03:05:53.500]   - Have you seen a therapist about this or?
[03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:54.340]   - Uh-uh.
[03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:55.300]   - I wonder what it means.
[03:05:55.300 --> 03:05:56.300]   (laughing)
[03:05:56.300 --> 03:05:57.980]   - So I've, and--
[03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:59.740]   - I'm sure there's a Freudian interpretation
[03:05:59.740 --> 03:06:00.660]   somewhere in there.
[03:06:00.660 --> 03:06:03.660]   That I'm going to also apply to my dating life.
[03:06:03.660 --> 03:06:07.020]   No, the joke is, the running joke continues.
[03:06:07.020 --> 03:06:12.020]   Okay, so, I mean, it's fascinating in general,
[03:06:12.020 --> 03:06:15.100]   as I hope we'll talk about in the early days of space flight
[03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:20.100]   that there is, the task of reaching out to the stars
[03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:22.260]   is a fundamentally risky one.
[03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:23.660]   You have to take risks, and of course,
[03:06:23.660 --> 03:06:26.580]   there's really rigorous safety precautions and so on,
[03:06:26.580 --> 03:06:27.900]   but it's still a risk.
[03:06:27.900 --> 03:06:30.740]   - Well, and I think like most people,
[03:06:30.740 --> 03:06:33.940]   for me, the idea of dying isn't so much about myself,
[03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:36.180]   it's about those affected by it, you know?
[03:06:36.180 --> 03:06:40.540]   My loved ones, my family, my girlfriend, my friends.
[03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:43.180]   Obviously, I don't want to have this be
[03:06:43.180 --> 03:06:45.700]   a traumatic experience for anybody.
[03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:46.540]   It's already gonna be hard.
[03:06:46.540 --> 03:06:49.140]   Like, it's already, I know, my mom gets,
[03:06:49.140 --> 03:06:52.040]   my parents and family and friends are very supportive,
[03:06:52.040 --> 03:06:56.500]   and my parents are all about it, of course,
[03:06:56.500 --> 03:06:59.020]   but my mom is also very emotional, too.
[03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:02.980]   So, speaking of athletes, my brother-in-law's actually
[03:07:02.980 --> 03:07:06.060]   been on "American Ninja Warrior" two seasons,
[03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:08.620]   phenomenal athlete, and even just when he competes,
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:10.060]   my mom gets so emotional, like,
[03:07:10.060 --> 03:07:12.380]   she can't even hold it together seeing that.
[03:07:12.380 --> 03:07:14.060]   So, what's it gonna be like when she sees her son
[03:07:14.060 --> 03:07:17.420]   get on top of a skyscraper and ascend
[03:07:17.420 --> 03:07:19.100]   on a column of flames into the heavens?
[03:07:19.100 --> 03:07:22.520]   Like, that's going to be very difficult, you know?
[03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:27.300]   And I've taken them out, they've seen "Star Race"
[03:07:27.300 --> 03:07:29.820]   and they've seen "Starship," they've seen a couple launches.
[03:07:29.820 --> 03:07:31.500]   - I don't know if that's gonna make him feel better.
[03:07:31.500 --> 03:07:33.620]   (laughing)
[03:07:33.620 --> 03:07:34.540]   - Exposure therapy, I guess.
[03:07:34.540 --> 03:07:36.080]   - Exposure therapy, okay.
[03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:39.940]   Have you had that conversation with them about this?
[03:07:39.940 --> 03:07:44.100]   Like, before agreeing to join?
[03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:46.580]   I mean, was that, what the, was that,
[03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:48.480]   or is it one of those things like,
[03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:54.740]   you just, you don't have that conversation?
[03:07:54.740 --> 03:07:55.580]   - I didn't have that conversation.
[03:07:55.580 --> 03:07:56.780]   - I suppose it's understood that there's a love,
[03:07:56.780 --> 03:07:58.420]   there's a passion here.
[03:07:58.420 --> 03:08:00.700]   - And realistically, I'm not,
[03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:05.980]   I'm going to be convinced and statistically convinced
[03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:08.200]   that this is relatively safe.
[03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:11.660]   You know, like, again, in the 99s, percent safe.
[03:08:11.660 --> 03:08:15.160]   Again, there's things that people do every day
[03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:17.540]   that are less safe than this, you know?
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:19.180]   - Like you riding a motorcycle.
[03:08:19.180 --> 03:08:20.180]   - Again, yeah, riding a motorcycle,
[03:08:20.180 --> 03:08:22.140]   doing wheelies at over 100 mile an hour, not--
[03:08:22.140 --> 03:08:25.780]   - You did wheelies over 100, what?
[03:08:25.780 --> 03:08:28.420]   All right.
[03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:29.900]   - I'm not a smart guy always, okay?
[03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:33.300]   Formation flying in the fighter jets
[03:08:33.300 --> 03:08:35.780]   was likely a more dangerous thing
[03:08:35.780 --> 03:08:39.160]   than what I'll be doing in space flight.
[03:08:42.380 --> 03:08:46.000]   - So as surreal as it is, we're talking about you
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:49.320]   flying around the moon.
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:53.640]   Let's rewind and talk about the origin story.
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:56.180]   What's the origin story of Everyday Astronaut?
[03:08:56.180 --> 03:08:59.040]   - I used to be a professional photographer.
[03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:02.160]   So from 2008 until the end of 2016,
[03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:05.280]   that was my income, was photography full-time.
[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:06.480]   - Like you were an Instagram model
[03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:08.360]   and took butt pictures of yourself?
[03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:10.440]   - Instagram fitness model, obviously.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:11.280]   - Obviously.
[03:09:11.860 --> 03:09:14.860]   - Now I did a lot of weddings.
[03:09:14.860 --> 03:09:17.660]   I shot 150 weddings all around the world.
[03:09:17.660 --> 03:09:19.300]   - So subjects, all kinds of material,
[03:09:19.300 --> 03:09:21.340]   like did you do portrait also?
[03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:22.180]   - A lot of portrait work
[03:09:22.180 --> 03:09:24.060]   and then just random commercial things
[03:09:24.060 --> 03:09:26.520]   like food and beverages for businesses
[03:09:26.520 --> 03:09:30.780]   or wheelchair ramp company, I shot their product.
[03:09:30.780 --> 03:09:31.980]   You know, it's random,
[03:09:31.980 --> 03:09:33.820]   whatever a professional photographer does
[03:09:33.820 --> 03:09:35.340]   in Cedar Falls, Iowa.
[03:09:35.340 --> 03:09:37.660]   - When did you fall in love with photography
[03:09:37.660 --> 03:09:39.060]   with a visual medium?
[03:09:39.060 --> 03:09:39.900]   Do you remember?
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:41.100]   - Yeah, I do actually remember.
[03:09:41.100 --> 03:09:45.100]   I grew up drawing constantly.
[03:09:45.100 --> 03:09:49.180]   I was the weird kid that I would bring a sketch pad
[03:09:49.180 --> 03:09:50.020]   to the restaurants,
[03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:51.900]   like every restaurant when I was growing up
[03:09:51.900 --> 03:09:53.420]   until I was like 18, 19,
[03:09:53.420 --> 03:09:54.820]   I literally would just sit there and draw
[03:09:54.820 --> 03:09:55.660]   or waiting for food.
[03:09:55.660 --> 03:09:56.820]   And my parents like fostered that.
[03:09:56.820 --> 03:09:58.540]   They would, you know,
[03:09:58.540 --> 03:09:59.860]   and I'd be the weird kid,
[03:09:59.860 --> 03:10:01.060]   but I'd be engaging and talking,
[03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:02.740]   but I'd be sitting there drawing.
[03:10:02.740 --> 03:10:05.100]   And I was always obsessed with realism
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:08.700]   and like recreating and visualizing things.
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:10.860]   And so when I got my hands on a camera,
[03:10:10.860 --> 03:10:12.340]   it was actually my dad's old Pentax
[03:10:12.340 --> 03:10:15.020]   that I first shot on a film camera
[03:10:15.020 --> 03:10:16.260]   and developing the film.
[03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:17.220]   I didn't personally develop it,
[03:10:17.220 --> 03:10:18.520]   like, you know, getting the film back,
[03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:19.480]   back in those days.
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:23.440]   You know, I just was like so excited about the idea
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:27.700]   that I had this visual thing that I saw with my own eyes
[03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:30.260]   and now I can stop time and capture it
[03:10:30.260 --> 03:10:32.020]   and show it to other people.
[03:10:32.020 --> 03:10:32.860]   Just kind of like, to me,
[03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:34.820]   that was like the ultimate form of realism
[03:10:34.820 --> 03:10:38.260]   was like literally showing you the photons basically
[03:10:38.260 --> 03:10:40.060]   that affected this film.
[03:10:41.060 --> 03:10:45.260]   And so, I mean, I was 19 when I got my first digital SLR
[03:10:45.260 --> 03:10:48.760]   at Canon 20D and started shooting.
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:51.900]   And yeah, I just, I fell in love with it.
[03:10:51.900 --> 03:10:54.020]   It became like, I got a job at a camera store
[03:10:54.020 --> 03:10:56.060]   and, you know, basically all my extra money
[03:10:56.060 --> 03:10:58.700]   went into buying everything that I could at the time.
[03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:00.940]   And I only worked there for about exactly a year
[03:11:00.940 --> 03:11:03.220]   before I went into pursuing photography full-time.
[03:11:03.220 --> 03:11:05.620]   And I basically was shooting weddings
[03:11:05.620 --> 03:11:07.900]   so that I could travel and pay, like, you know,
[03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:11.340]   afford to be able to do some big trips every year
[03:11:11.340 --> 03:11:14.620]   and develop some kind of, you know, portfolio of traveling.
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:18.300]   And not necessarily like, not for, you know,
[03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:19.940]   I guess Instagram wasn't much of a thing at the time.
[03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:21.980]   It was really just, I liked making big prints
[03:11:21.980 --> 03:11:25.820]   and having them displayed and that kind of stuff.
[03:11:25.820 --> 03:11:27.020]   And pretty soon-
[03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:28.660]   - Are you still a Canon guy?
[03:11:28.660 --> 03:11:30.380]   You still a Canon elitist?
[03:11:30.380 --> 03:11:32.780]   - No, no, I moved around.
[03:11:32.780 --> 03:11:34.260]   I did Sony for a bit.
[03:11:34.260 --> 03:11:36.540]   I still kind of shoot mostly Canon glass,
[03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:39.820]   but adapted to either Sony, like lenses,
[03:11:39.820 --> 03:11:41.420]   sorry, like Canon lenses.
[03:11:41.420 --> 03:11:42.340]   - Look at you.
[03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:46.460]   What do you think about these things that I'm using?
[03:11:46.460 --> 03:11:48.500]   Sony a7 IV.
[03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:49.420]   - Great.
[03:11:49.420 --> 03:11:50.820]   - It's great, see, yeah.
[03:11:50.820 --> 03:11:54.620]   It's, I've been, you know, I Googled around
[03:11:54.620 --> 03:11:57.660]   just trying to find a camera that can do video
[03:11:57.660 --> 03:11:59.620]   and photography pretty well.
[03:11:59.620 --> 03:12:03.700]   And obviously going with just like generic lenses,
[03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:06.020]   prime lenses, I resisted everything.
[03:12:06.020 --> 03:12:07.620]   My whole journey with these camera thing,
[03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:09.140]   I'm trying to figure stuff out,
[03:12:09.140 --> 03:12:11.900]   is like prime lenses seem so stupid.
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:14.660]   So prime lenses is like a fixed zoom thing.
[03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:16.340]   It's like, why?
[03:12:16.340 --> 03:12:18.580]   'Cause I remember I was going to like Ukraine
[03:12:18.580 --> 03:12:21.540]   and thinking it's similar, like,
[03:12:21.540 --> 03:12:24.420]   yeah, very similar to space flight.
[03:12:24.420 --> 03:12:25.900]   But you're very constrained
[03:12:25.900 --> 03:12:28.140]   because you're going into an unknown environment.
[03:12:28.140 --> 03:12:30.580]   You go into a war zone, you go into a front,
[03:12:30.580 --> 03:12:32.900]   you don't know what, like you don't know anything.
[03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:34.980]   And there's like a little suitcase you have to like see,
[03:12:34.980 --> 03:12:36.540]   figure out like, how do you film this?
[03:12:36.540 --> 03:12:39.100]   What's robust?
[03:12:39.100 --> 03:12:40.860]   What gives you like a good image
[03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:43.420]   versus the flexibility versus the weight?
[03:12:43.420 --> 03:12:44.460]   'Cause weight is important there.
[03:12:44.460 --> 03:12:46.020]   You have to think about like,
[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:48.100]   can you really bring like a bunch of zoom lenses
[03:12:48.100 --> 03:12:49.260]   and all that kind of stuff.
[03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:51.380]   So I had to learn really quickly, but yeah.
[03:12:51.380 --> 03:12:54.700]   It's a whole journey that you've already been on,
[03:12:54.700 --> 03:12:56.940]   but it's nice to have a beginner like me,
[03:12:56.940 --> 03:12:59.620]   like to explore that.
[03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:02.900]   I think there's a nice thing,
[03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:04.340]   just like as we've been talking about
[03:13:04.340 --> 03:13:06.060]   with the beginner's mind,
[03:13:06.060 --> 03:13:11.060]   to not let equipment get in the way of like,
[03:13:11.060 --> 03:13:14.940]   what your vision is of what a thing should look like.
[03:13:14.940 --> 03:13:18.260]   Sometimes like, especially if you're a professional
[03:13:18.260 --> 03:13:21.500]   videographer, photographer, cinematographer,
[03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:22.820]   whatever you call it,
[03:13:22.820 --> 03:13:25.860]   you can like fetishize equipment too much.
[03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:27.660]   You could get so much equipment.
[03:13:27.660 --> 03:13:28.660]   And I've interacted with that
[03:13:28.660 --> 03:13:30.340]   'cause I've been trying to learn from other people
[03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:33.020]   that have so much more experience than me.
[03:13:33.020 --> 03:13:35.420]   I think their advice is often like,
[03:13:35.420 --> 03:13:42.180]   pushing a lot of equipment versus like the final thing.
[03:13:42.180 --> 03:13:44.580]   Like how do you create the art of it?
[03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:49.380]   'Cause to me, even photography is just like storytelling.
[03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:54.380]   And so like a lot of the discussion to me that I enjoy,
[03:13:54.380 --> 03:13:56.460]   especially talking to creative people,
[03:13:56.460 --> 03:13:58.780]   is like the final story.
[03:13:58.780 --> 03:14:00.940]   Like how, and I've learned, you know,
[03:14:00.940 --> 03:14:04.940]   like light, light is a weird thing.
[03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:07.100]   Like it's so interesting.
[03:14:07.100 --> 03:14:10.860]   It's so interesting how you can create emotion with light.
[03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:14.940]   Like with a little, you can take a phone
[03:14:14.940 --> 03:14:17.380]   and like you light your face in different ways
[03:14:17.380 --> 03:14:19.780]   and like it changes the emotion.
[03:14:19.780 --> 03:14:21.060]   It's so weird.
[03:14:21.060 --> 03:14:23.780]   I'm like, holy shit.
[03:14:23.780 --> 03:14:26.620]   'Cause like that's the conversation I wanna have.
[03:14:26.620 --> 03:14:28.460]   People give me advice how to light a scene
[03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:30.060]   and all that kind of stuff is great.
[03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:33.620]   But the reality is that a little bit of light
[03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:34.860]   in a different direction,
[03:14:34.860 --> 03:14:37.100]   you have to understand how that changes.
[03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:39.660]   - The contour on your face and everything.
[03:14:39.660 --> 03:14:41.700]   - And the expression that your face can,
[03:14:41.700 --> 03:14:47.060]   the expression that could be effectively communicated
[03:14:47.060 --> 03:14:49.380]   under different lighting conditions.
[03:14:49.380 --> 03:14:53.660]   And then like the mystery of like having some of your face
[03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:55.660]   in darkness and some not,
[03:14:55.660 --> 03:14:58.900]   or when you can only see the eyes and not the face,
[03:14:58.900 --> 03:15:00.860]   when the background is visible or not.
[03:15:00.860 --> 03:15:05.860]   I mean, yeah, it's all just like this interesting art form
[03:15:05.860 --> 03:15:09.100]   that can be so powerful when you're telling a story.
[03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:11.500]   - Well, and what's fun for with me with photography
[03:15:11.500 --> 03:15:13.860]   and rockets, they're both like the ultimate story
[03:15:13.860 --> 03:15:14.860]   of compromise.
[03:15:14.860 --> 03:15:16.100]   'Cause when you start learning about photography,
[03:15:16.100 --> 03:15:18.980]   you learn about how the aperture affects both your exposure,
[03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:21.060]   but also your depth of field, higher shutter speed,
[03:15:21.060 --> 03:15:23.100]   affects both your exposure, your depth of field,
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:27.700]   how the medium format camera versus a crop camera affects,
[03:15:27.700 --> 03:15:30.660]   everything is a compromise and price versus performance.
[03:15:30.660 --> 03:15:32.740]   You're like, there's always a compromise.
[03:15:32.740 --> 03:15:34.700]   You're always literally doing like a trade study
[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:36.000]   of what can I afford?
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:36.880]   What's my outcome?
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:38.140]   Like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:15:38.140 --> 03:15:40.680]   How fast is the autofocus or whatever?
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:41.540]   Same with rockets.
[03:15:41.540 --> 03:15:45.060]   Like there's a million choices and every single one of them
[03:15:45.060 --> 03:15:46.440]   affects every single thing.
[03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:48.500]   So there's always all these trades and it's so cool
[03:15:48.500 --> 03:15:52.320]   that you can see the same, totally different outcomes
[03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:53.940]   based on the same like requirements.
[03:15:53.940 --> 03:15:56.940]   You know, like do X, then here's how we're gonna do it.
[03:15:56.940 --> 03:15:58.580]   And, you know, two teams of people
[03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:00.740]   will come up with wildly different things.
[03:16:00.740 --> 03:16:03.980]   - When did you fall in love with rockets?
[03:16:03.980 --> 03:16:06.980]   - So yeah, so the story kind of keeps going for me.
[03:16:06.980 --> 03:16:07.820]   So I was doing-
[03:16:07.820 --> 03:16:08.640]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:10.580]   (laughing)
[03:16:10.580 --> 03:16:11.700]   - Can't talk photography, man.
[03:16:11.700 --> 03:16:14.340]   We'll go down a deep rabbit hole there.
[03:16:14.340 --> 03:16:18.360]   So it ended, you know, through all this,
[03:16:18.360 --> 03:16:20.460]   doing a lot of weddings, I was already getting saturated
[03:16:20.460 --> 03:16:23.140]   and feeling like I'm not being as creative.
[03:16:23.140 --> 03:16:25.140]   You know, you can only shoot them so many weddings
[03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:26.980]   before you're like, well, now we do this pose,
[03:16:26.980 --> 03:16:27.820]   this pose, this pose.
[03:16:27.820 --> 03:16:29.420]   You know, even if like they're amazing places,
[03:16:29.420 --> 03:16:31.980]   like, you know, in front of a castle in Germany or something
[03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:33.700]   I'm still like, well, it's the end of the day,
[03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:37.140]   I'm not being very creative, you know?
[03:16:37.140 --> 03:16:41.500]   So I remember craving like some projects.
[03:16:41.500 --> 03:16:45.540]   And so I was sitting at my friend's coffee shop
[03:16:45.540 --> 03:16:48.740]   in my hometown in Cedar Falls, Sidecar Coffee.
[03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:50.260]   And I'm sitting on this red couch
[03:16:50.260 --> 03:16:52.980]   and I see this article from I think Gizmodo.
[03:16:52.980 --> 03:16:56.500]   And it said, you could own the flight stick
[03:16:56.500 --> 03:16:58.140]   of an Apollo command module.
[03:16:58.140 --> 03:17:00.700]   And I knew enough to know what that meant,
[03:17:00.700 --> 03:17:03.260]   but that's really about the end of my space knowledge.
[03:17:03.260 --> 03:17:04.900]   And so I clicked on it, the click bait got me.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:07.300]   Like, I'm like, oh yeah, I'm gonna see if, you know,
[03:17:07.300 --> 03:17:09.940]   and see that the minimum bid was like $250,000.
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:12.860]   And I'm like, okay, no, I can't own the Apollo joystick,
[03:17:12.860 --> 03:17:16.060]   you know, but it got me on this website called RROction.
[03:17:16.060 --> 03:17:17.420]   And so I started scrolling through that,
[03:17:17.420 --> 03:17:19.460]   looking for things that hadn't been bid on.
[03:17:19.460 --> 03:17:20.500]   And they had like, you know, at the time
[03:17:20.500 --> 03:17:22.740]   they were doing a huge space auction.
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:25.220]   And so I'm looking for things just out of curiosity, fun.
[03:17:25.220 --> 03:17:27.580]   These are cool, like starting to really, you know,
[03:17:27.580 --> 03:17:28.820]   like I said, I like space,
[03:17:28.820 --> 03:17:30.660]   but I wasn't like in love with it or anything,
[03:17:30.660 --> 03:17:34.340]   but I'm very just seeing all this stuff.
[03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:35.340]   I'm like, this is so cool.
[03:17:35.340 --> 03:17:37.500]   Look at all this old history stuff.
[03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:41.940]   Ended up seeing, there's an article for a VMSTK-44
[03:17:41.940 --> 03:17:46.780]   flight suit, high altitude flight suit
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:50.060]   that came from the Soviet Union and looks, you know,
[03:17:50.060 --> 03:17:52.860]   it's like a MiG fighter jet, fighter pilot suit,
[03:17:52.860 --> 03:17:56.180]   very similar to like the SR-71, like kind of pumpkin suit,
[03:17:56.180 --> 03:17:59.980]   semi-pressure suit with a full helmet.
[03:17:59.980 --> 03:18:02.020]   I mean, it looks like a space suit, you know,
[03:18:02.020 --> 03:18:05.460]   for all intents and purposes, it's kind of like a space suit.
[03:18:05.460 --> 03:18:09.780]   And I just bid on it, you know, I bid like, I think $325.
[03:18:09.780 --> 03:18:12.380]   And next thing you know, like it arrives at my door.
[03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:17.020]   And from that point on, like literally I got it out,
[03:18:17.020 --> 03:18:18.900]   I immediately tried to put it on.
[03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:21.220]   And the first thing that I do is almost die in it
[03:18:21.220 --> 03:18:25.180]   because I closed the helmet down on myself and locked it
[03:18:25.180 --> 03:18:27.140]   and didn't know how to unlock it.
[03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:30.980]   So I'm literally, and so as soon as I seal it up,
[03:18:30.980 --> 03:18:32.820]   I'm realizing I can't breathe.
[03:18:32.820 --> 03:18:33.780]   I'm going to run out of air.
[03:18:33.780 --> 03:18:35.860]   So luckily like there's a hose, you know,
[03:18:35.860 --> 03:18:37.420]   kind of that long hose thing that would normally plug
[03:18:37.420 --> 03:18:39.580]   into an air supply, had a little plug on the end of it.
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:42.020]   So I just unplugged it and was able to temporarily breathe
[03:18:42.020 --> 03:18:44.980]   through the hose until I figured out the locking mechanism.
[03:18:44.980 --> 03:18:47.780]   So there was my almost, that was my mortality rate thing
[03:18:47.780 --> 03:18:50.860]   right there, so that was probably above a 98
[03:18:50.860 --> 03:18:51.700]   or below a 98.
[03:18:51.700 --> 03:18:55.260]   - So you're there panicking inside for a few seconds.
[03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:57.780]   - Already reading like my premature obituary,
[03:18:57.780 --> 03:19:00.420]   like idiot dies alone in space suit in his living room.
[03:19:00.420 --> 03:19:02.540]   You know, like just imagine,
[03:19:02.540 --> 03:19:05.740]   that would be like Darwin award for sure, for sure.
[03:19:05.740 --> 03:19:10.820]   So I get the space suit and it kind of-
[03:19:10.820 --> 03:19:12.980]   - That's literally take my breath away.
[03:19:12.980 --> 03:19:17.340]   - You should feel bad for that one.
[03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:19.540]   You introduced Creed to me,
[03:19:19.540 --> 03:19:22.460]   so you should feel bad about that one.
[03:19:22.460 --> 03:19:23.500]   Stars wide open.
[03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:29.220]   - Okay, so I ended up like the space suit kind of like
[03:19:29.220 --> 03:19:31.060]   more or less haunted me, 'cause it kind of just,
[03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:32.980]   it sat in like my living room for a long time
[03:19:32.980 --> 03:19:34.620]   and I didn't know what to do with it.
[03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:37.140]   And I actually had a friend who is also a photographer,
[03:19:37.140 --> 03:19:38.540]   wanted to do like a photo.
[03:19:38.540 --> 03:19:39.820]   He was just kind of taking pictures randomly.
[03:19:39.820 --> 03:19:41.060]   He's like, "Hey, bring your space suit over.
[03:19:41.060 --> 03:19:42.300]   We'll do a picture."
[03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:44.020]   It's like, all right, you know, I walk across the street,
[03:19:44.020 --> 03:19:45.940]   like literally lived across the street, Taylor.
[03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:48.500]   And I put the space suit on, I took this funny picture,
[03:19:48.500 --> 03:19:49.500]   I'm like, "This is awesome."
[03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:51.980]   And I got a lot of like fun out of like creating a character,
[03:19:51.980 --> 03:19:53.140]   you know, of everyday astronaut,
[03:19:53.140 --> 03:19:56.260]   or at the time, I guess I didn't know, an astronaut.
[03:19:56.260 --> 03:19:57.780]   And then that kind of just continued.
[03:19:57.780 --> 03:20:00.420]   I was like thinking of more and more funny situations
[03:20:00.420 --> 03:20:02.540]   where I could have this astronaut on earth
[03:20:02.540 --> 03:20:04.940]   doing mundane everyday things
[03:20:04.940 --> 03:20:06.820]   and came up with the name everyday astronaut.
[03:20:06.820 --> 03:20:09.180]   And originally it was just literally a photo project,
[03:20:09.180 --> 03:20:12.260]   like this whole art series of an astronaut
[03:20:12.260 --> 03:20:15.100]   doing these things, these funny, whimsical,
[03:20:15.100 --> 03:20:16.500]   you know, silly mundane things.
[03:20:16.500 --> 03:20:18.540]   But I was researching a lot about like,
[03:20:18.540 --> 03:20:19.700]   you know, I was trying to hide Easter eggs.
[03:20:19.700 --> 03:20:21.900]   Like I was gonna hide in like the, you know,
[03:20:21.900 --> 03:20:25.980]   the echocardiogram of Alan Shepard, you know,
[03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:27.700]   like his first flight into space
[03:20:27.700 --> 03:20:29.460]   and Photoshopping that into pictures.
[03:20:29.460 --> 03:20:31.660]   And like, you know, doing all these little like facts
[03:20:31.660 --> 03:20:32.580]   about space flight,
[03:20:32.580 --> 03:20:35.020]   but they're just hidden little elements in these photos.
[03:20:35.020 --> 03:20:37.220]   And man, doing that, I just fell in love with it.
[03:20:37.220 --> 03:20:39.460]   I just was going over every little detail
[03:20:39.460 --> 03:20:40.380]   that I could learn.
[03:20:40.380 --> 03:20:42.420]   I just couldn't stop learning.
[03:20:42.420 --> 03:20:44.220]   And I was getting excited 'cause I was like,
[03:20:44.220 --> 03:20:46.940]   I could be teaching people about all this exciting stuff
[03:20:46.940 --> 03:20:48.780]   and all the cool things people figured out,
[03:20:48.780 --> 03:20:51.260]   you know, 40 years ago, 50 years ago.
[03:20:51.260 --> 03:20:54.140]   And was trying to portray that through images on Instagram.
[03:20:54.140 --> 03:20:55.980]   And, you know, it took me a little while,
[03:20:55.980 --> 03:20:57.660]   but eventually I realized, you know,
[03:20:57.660 --> 03:20:58.800]   on Instagram, your retention rate,
[03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:01.400]   you're lucky if you get like two seconds
[03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:03.020]   of someone looking at an image, you know,
[03:21:03.020 --> 03:21:04.620]   or maybe nowadays 60 seconds
[03:21:04.620 --> 03:21:07.460]   of a quick little Instagram short or something.
[03:21:07.460 --> 03:21:10.580]   But yeah, I--
[03:21:10.580 --> 03:21:12.540]   - It doesn't give you a chance to really teach
[03:21:12.540 --> 03:21:15.340]   to explore a little topic that you felt,
[03:21:15.340 --> 03:21:16.900]   like you felt the curiosity about the thing.
[03:21:16.900 --> 03:21:17.900]   There's so much to learn here.
[03:21:17.900 --> 03:21:18.740]   This is so beautiful.
[03:21:18.740 --> 03:21:20.900]   - There's so many opportunities to have a light bulb
[03:21:20.900 --> 03:21:23.660]   go off for someone and be like, this is awesome.
[03:21:23.660 --> 03:21:26.020]   And so, yeah, I think I started,
[03:21:26.020 --> 03:21:28.420]   so by the end of 2016, like throughout 2016,
[03:21:28.420 --> 03:21:32.360]   I realized I wanna be done doing photography as a profession
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:33.980]   and I want to pursue everyday astronaut.
[03:21:33.980 --> 03:21:35.340]   But I didn't know what it meant yet.
[03:21:35.340 --> 03:21:37.580]   I just knew like I had this thing, you know,
[03:21:37.580 --> 03:21:39.980]   and at that time I'd been doing it for roughly two years
[03:21:39.980 --> 03:21:41.900]   and had, you know, seen, I don't know,
[03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:43.940]   like 50,000 Instagram followers or something.
[03:21:43.940 --> 03:21:46.540]   I thought like I could just be a full-time influencer now,
[03:21:46.540 --> 03:21:49.500]   you know, like just go around taking pictures of myself
[03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:52.140]   in a space suit and doing public appearances
[03:21:52.140 --> 03:21:53.420]   and write a children's book or something.
[03:21:53.420 --> 03:21:54.260]   I don't know.
[03:21:54.260 --> 03:21:55.540]   I don't know what this thing is.
[03:21:55.540 --> 03:21:57.140]   I'll figure it out, you know?
[03:21:57.140 --> 03:22:01.580]   And so, basically I gave myself like a runway of one year,
[03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:04.140]   of 2017 of like, I'm gonna throw stuff at the wall
[03:22:04.140 --> 03:22:05.940]   and see what sticks.
[03:22:05.940 --> 03:22:07.340]   So I was doing like Twitch streams.
[03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:09.460]   I was playing Kerbal Space Program,
[03:22:09.460 --> 03:22:11.300]   which is like a video game,
[03:22:11.300 --> 03:22:14.860]   like a physics-based rocket building simulation game,
[03:22:14.860 --> 03:22:16.340]   but it's also like, it's fun and silly
[03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:18.020]   'cause you're not playing with like humans.
[03:22:18.020 --> 03:22:19.660]   You're playing with these little Kerbal,
[03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:23.260]   like little alien guys and it's fun and silly.
[03:22:23.260 --> 03:22:25.660]   You know, I was streaming that on Twitch and doing things
[03:22:25.660 --> 03:22:28.580]   and posting some of those things onto YouTube.
[03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:29.420]   But finally, like I said,
[03:22:29.420 --> 03:22:32.700]   it actually happened to be February 27th, 2017
[03:22:32.700 --> 03:22:34.420]   when SpaceX had that announcement
[03:22:34.420 --> 03:22:35.380]   that they're flying someone around the moon
[03:22:35.380 --> 03:22:38.140]   that I'm, I gotta tell people about this
[03:22:38.140 --> 03:22:40.660]   and stood there and made my first like
[03:22:40.660 --> 03:22:42.340]   produced YouTube video.
[03:22:42.340 --> 03:22:44.980]   And I didn't want it to be over three minutes.
[03:22:44.980 --> 03:22:47.460]   I was afraid that'd be way too long for YouTube.
[03:22:47.460 --> 03:22:49.100]   And I got it down to like, I don't know,
[03:22:49.100 --> 03:22:51.140]   two minutes and 40 seconds or something.
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:51.980]   And that video-
[03:22:51.980 --> 03:22:53.340]   - Were you wearing the-
[03:22:53.340 --> 03:22:54.740]   - I was wearing the space suit.
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:55.820]   - The space suit. - Yep, yep.
[03:22:55.820 --> 03:22:58.220]   And very like horrible audio.
[03:22:58.220 --> 03:23:00.660]   It looks like it was color graded by a seven-year-old
[03:23:00.660 --> 03:23:02.300]   with a tan marker or something.
[03:23:02.300 --> 03:23:03.700]   Like it just looks terrible.
[03:23:03.700 --> 03:23:04.540]   Sounds horrible.
[03:23:04.540 --> 03:23:05.740]   I'm yelling.
[03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:07.220]   No one's happy.
[03:23:07.220 --> 03:23:11.020]   But the video, you know, did relatively well.
[03:23:11.020 --> 03:23:12.660]   Like I had no followers on YouTube.
[03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:15.260]   Like I had, you know, maybe 102 or something.
[03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:16.340]   - Is the video still up?
[03:23:16.340 --> 03:23:17.180]   - Yeah.
[03:23:17.180 --> 03:23:18.020]   - That's great.
[03:23:18.020 --> 03:23:18.860]   I'll go to watch it after this.
[03:23:18.860 --> 03:23:20.700]   - It's so cringy.
[03:23:20.700 --> 03:23:22.020]   And as it should be, you know,
[03:23:22.020 --> 03:23:23.740]   your first video should be terrible.
[03:23:23.740 --> 03:23:24.580]   If it's not terrible,
[03:23:24.580 --> 03:23:26.380]   then you spent too long trying to make it.
[03:23:26.380 --> 03:23:30.400]   So the thing that clicked for me is
[03:23:30.400 --> 03:23:32.140]   I had very little audience
[03:23:32.140 --> 03:23:34.280]   and all of a sudden that video kind of took off,
[03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:35.120]   you know, relatively.
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:36.980]   I think it got like 10,000 or 12,000 views.
[03:23:36.980 --> 03:23:38.140]   And I was like, holy crap,
[03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:40.180]   that's way more engagement than I'd have.
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:41.020]   - Famous.
[03:23:41.020 --> 03:23:42.260]   - I'm famous now.
[03:23:42.260 --> 03:23:45.020]   10,000 people, that's almost my whole town.
[03:23:45.020 --> 03:23:46.540]   - First of all, that is kind of crazy.
[03:23:46.540 --> 03:23:48.300]   Like 10,000 people is crazy.
[03:23:48.300 --> 03:23:49.140]   It's crazy.
[03:23:49.140 --> 03:23:53.020]   Like if you had 500 people attend a thing that you do,
[03:23:53.020 --> 03:23:56.300]   that would be like, you're like a rockstar.
[03:23:56.300 --> 03:23:57.460]   It's crazy.
[03:23:57.460 --> 03:23:58.500]   - We lose perspective.
[03:23:58.500 --> 03:24:00.460]   - Yeah, we lose perspective very quickly.
[03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:01.300]   - Very quickly.
[03:24:01.300 --> 03:24:03.640]   So I'd made another video.
[03:24:03.640 --> 03:24:04.940]   This one I spent more time on.
[03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:07.100]   And I had, before photography,
[03:24:07.100 --> 03:24:09.500]   actually I used to do like wedding videography too.
[03:24:09.500 --> 03:24:11.700]   So I had done my woes with videography
[03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:12.780]   and weddings and stuff.
[03:24:12.780 --> 03:24:13.980]   I hated video.
[03:24:13.980 --> 03:24:15.820]   Like I thought video was the worst,
[03:24:15.820 --> 03:24:17.180]   took so long to edit.
[03:24:17.180 --> 03:24:18.020]   You know, and I love photography.
[03:24:18.020 --> 03:24:20.060]   It's like, boom, you snap it, boom, post,
[03:24:20.060 --> 03:24:21.580]   you're done in an hour, you know?
[03:24:21.580 --> 03:24:23.420]   And video, it's like this whole cumbersome thing.
[03:24:23.420 --> 03:24:25.540]   So I thought I'll never do video.
[03:24:25.540 --> 03:24:27.100]   And here I was making this long,
[03:24:27.100 --> 03:24:28.620]   what at the time seemed like a long,
[03:24:28.620 --> 03:24:30.180]   seven minute long YouTube video
[03:24:30.180 --> 03:24:32.380]   about how the Falcon 9 lands.
[03:24:32.380 --> 03:24:34.100]   And again, like that one I posted it
[03:24:34.100 --> 03:24:35.420]   and actually it did really bad.
[03:24:35.420 --> 03:24:36.260]   And I was really upset.
[03:24:36.260 --> 03:24:39.460]   I'm like, I spent two weeks on this stupid video,
[03:24:39.460 --> 03:24:42.380]   you know, worked really hard scripting and blah, blah, blah.
[03:24:42.380 --> 03:24:44.340]   And then it, you know, had like a thousand views
[03:24:44.340 --> 03:24:46.460]   or something, it did much worse than the first video.
[03:24:46.460 --> 03:24:47.860]   And I was so upset.
[03:24:47.860 --> 03:24:49.700]   And I kind of like was ready to keep throwing
[03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:50.540]   more spaghetti at the wall
[03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:52.740]   to see what's gonna stick for everyday astronaut.
[03:24:52.740 --> 03:24:54.380]   And I think it was like a month or two later,
[03:24:54.380 --> 03:24:55.460]   I happened to like, you know,
[03:24:55.460 --> 03:24:58.380]   check the analytics on YouTube and all of a sudden,
[03:24:58.380 --> 03:25:00.440]   that video like kind of took off.
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:02.900]   And it got like 40 or 50 or 60,000 views or something.
[03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:04.660]   I was like, no way.
[03:25:04.660 --> 03:25:06.500]   And it just kept, you know, that just honed it in more
[03:25:06.500 --> 03:25:09.060]   that like, okay, YouTube will bring a bigger,
[03:25:09.060 --> 03:25:10.860]   like bring an audience to me,
[03:25:10.860 --> 03:25:11.780]   as opposed to like Instagram,
[03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:14.180]   I had to find and, you know,
[03:25:14.180 --> 03:25:15.580]   try to get the audience to come to me.
[03:25:15.580 --> 03:25:17.720]   And this was like, they were gonna do the legwork.
[03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:20.340]   So if I make decent videos,
[03:25:20.340 --> 03:25:22.300]   and I realized like really the fun thing for me
[03:25:22.300 --> 03:25:25.500]   was explaining a topic that was scary and intimidating
[03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:28.000]   and try to make it, you know, fun and engaging.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:29.660]   - What were some of the struggles
[03:25:29.660 --> 03:25:31.940]   of building up a YouTube channel?
[03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:33.980]   So for people who don't know, once again,
[03:25:33.980 --> 03:25:35.020]   (laughing)
[03:25:35.020 --> 03:25:38.260]   you have a YouTube channel called Everyday Astronaut,
[03:25:38.260 --> 03:25:39.580]   and there's some incredible videos on it.
[03:25:39.580 --> 03:25:40.740]   So what was the,
[03:25:40.740 --> 03:25:42.380]   what was the some of the challenges
[03:25:42.380 --> 03:25:44.420]   and the struggles in the early days?
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:45.660]   - Definitely like at first,
[03:25:45.660 --> 03:25:47.020]   you're not gonna find your own voice.
[03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:48.120]   And I know like even, you know,
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:50.140]   Jimmy talked to you about that,
[03:25:50.140 --> 03:25:51.540]   like how your first video is gonna suck.
[03:25:51.540 --> 03:25:52.780]   You don't, you're not gonna be yourself.
[03:25:52.780 --> 03:25:53.620]   You're gonna be nervous.
[03:25:53.620 --> 03:25:55.780]   You're gonna be, you're not gonna know the tone, the pace,
[03:25:55.780 --> 03:25:57.780]   the things that are interesting.
[03:25:57.780 --> 03:26:00.280]   And actually, originally I had constraints.
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:02.580]   I was really worried about making a short video
[03:26:02.580 --> 03:26:04.300]   'cause I thought there's no way anyone's gonna watch
[03:26:04.300 --> 03:26:06.620]   a three minute video and then a seven minute video.
[03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:09.140]   And pretty quickly I realized like YouTube as a whole
[03:26:09.140 --> 03:26:10.340]   was kind of changing,
[03:26:10.340 --> 03:26:13.340]   but also there's always that historic backbone
[03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:16.380]   of like 22 minutes of programming
[03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:18.540]   for a 30 minute spot on TV.
[03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:21.020]   Like no one goes over 22 or 44 minutes,
[03:26:21.020 --> 03:26:22.660]   you know, if you have the full hour special or whatever,
[03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:24.780]   like that is the absolute limit
[03:26:24.780 --> 03:26:27.980]   of what a human being can watch, you know,
[03:26:27.980 --> 03:26:29.860]   basically it was what I thought.
[03:26:29.860 --> 03:26:32.400]   And slowly I just kept playing and getting longer
[03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:35.400]   and actually more and more in depth into the topics.
[03:26:35.400 --> 03:26:36.920]   And instead of getting like pushback, you know,
[03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:38.680]   and being like, this is so boring.
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:40.060]   I realized as long as it's like,
[03:26:40.060 --> 03:26:42.360]   as I was walking people through the whole step,
[03:26:42.360 --> 03:26:44.640]   you know, giving them all the context they need,
[03:26:44.640 --> 03:26:46.640]   they're happy to get as deep into the weeds
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:47.880]   as I can get them.
[03:26:47.880 --> 03:26:49.840]   And so that just kind of fed the snowball
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:51.920]   just kept rolling and I'm like, all right.
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:53.160]   And you know, before you know it,
[03:26:53.160 --> 03:26:54.640]   I'm making hour long videos,
[03:26:54.640 --> 03:26:57.520]   like an hour long is more or less a normal length
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:27:00.100]   on my channel for a produced video.
[03:27:00.100 --> 03:27:03.140]   And they're really, really in depth,
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:06.260]   but I love like that process of trying to preemptively
[03:27:06.260 --> 03:27:08.700]   kind of guess what the questions might be.
[03:27:08.700 --> 03:27:10.520]   And, you know, part of that is like,
[03:27:10.520 --> 03:27:13.660]   we do like script read-throughs with like our supporters
[03:27:13.660 --> 03:27:16.140]   and do like cuts of videos and people,
[03:27:16.140 --> 03:27:18.660]   a decent amount of people see it before it goes public.
[03:27:18.660 --> 03:27:20.300]   And we get those questions out of the way, you know,
[03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:22.220]   we get those people asking the questions.
[03:27:22.220 --> 03:27:25.700]   And then I love nothing more than trying to, you know,
[03:27:25.700 --> 03:27:28.500]   get all those questions answered by the end of the video.
[03:27:28.500 --> 03:27:32.480]   - A question about being a creator on YouTube,
[03:27:32.480 --> 03:27:35.400]   that could be a challenging psychological aspect to it,
[03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:39.260]   which is like, you might invest a huge amount of your effort
[03:27:39.260 --> 03:27:44.200]   into a thing and it doesn't receive much attention at all.
[03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:46.760]   And, you know, there's something about YouTube
[03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:49.000]   and in general social media
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.280]   that makes you feel really crappy about that.
[03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:54.960]   If you let it, if you really look at the numbers,
[03:27:54.960 --> 03:27:57.600]   it's very, very difficult not to pay attention to that.
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:27:59.680]   I mean, that's the reason why I turn off numbers
[03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:04.180]   on my interface for stuff that I've created.
[03:28:04.180 --> 03:28:07.140]   'Cause I just see it having a negative effect on your mind.
[03:28:07.140 --> 03:28:09.360]   But even then, it still has an effect.
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:15.600]   Your epic video on the history of Soviet rockets
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:19.860]   comes to mind, and we'll talk about that in a second,
[03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:22.800]   but it's called, people should check it out,
[03:28:22.800 --> 03:28:25.520]   the entire Soviet rocket engine family tree.
[03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:28.120]   So that's something you've researched for two years.
[03:28:28.120 --> 03:28:29.160]   - Yeah.
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:30.960]   - Right, you put your heart and soul into it.
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:33.720]   There's a lot of passion, there's a long journey,
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:36.360]   and I think about like an hour and a half video.
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:41.160]   Is there like, is there challenges?
[03:28:41.160 --> 03:28:44.280]   Is there like, how difficult is that
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:46.760]   to put so much of yourself into a video
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:49.160]   and it maybe not do so well?
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:53.680]   - Yeah, that's the struggle for sure, honestly.
[03:28:53.680 --> 03:28:57.520]   Especially as we grow, I try to make better
[03:28:57.520 --> 03:29:00.200]   and better videos, which means hiring more and more people
[03:29:00.200 --> 03:29:03.240]   to do higher end animations and spend more time editing
[03:29:03.240 --> 03:29:05.120]   and shooting and scripting.
[03:29:05.120 --> 03:29:07.200]   But at the end of the day,
[03:29:07.200 --> 03:29:10.160]   it still can't be just losing money.
[03:29:10.160 --> 03:29:13.180]   And I have videos that definitely lose a lot of money
[03:29:13.180 --> 03:29:16.200]   because I hire 3D artists and stuff.
[03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:21.440]   And I was so certain, the Soviet rocket engine video,
[03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:24.040]   I thought was just purely gonna be a passion project.
[03:29:24.040 --> 03:29:27.080]   I honestly was like, if it ever crosses a million,
[03:29:27.080 --> 03:29:28.240]   it's a home run.
[03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:30.760]   - And is it, does it cross like a couple of million now?
[03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:34.240]   - I think it's a little over two, which is insane to me.
[03:29:34.240 --> 03:29:36.880]   Like I just really thought this was more something
[03:29:36.880 --> 03:29:39.240]   just to put on the shelf as a resource, almost for myself,
[03:29:39.240 --> 03:29:41.260]   you know, like just to kind of have that knowledge bank
[03:29:41.260 --> 03:29:43.140]   and something I've always wanted to straighten out
[03:29:43.140 --> 03:29:45.800]   in my own head and kind of know the history
[03:29:45.800 --> 03:29:46.880]   a little bit better.
[03:29:46.880 --> 03:29:48.840]   But come to find out, like it took a while,
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:49.920]   you know, it was a slow turn.
[03:29:49.920 --> 03:29:52.520]   - Well, I remember when you first released it
[03:29:52.520 --> 03:29:53.980]   and that's when I watched it.
[03:29:53.980 --> 03:29:58.080]   I remember like, this has so few views.
[03:29:58.080 --> 03:29:58.900]   - Yeah.
[03:29:58.900 --> 03:30:00.040]   - I remember being just sad.
[03:30:00.040 --> 03:30:03.840]   Like I was like sad about the state of the world
[03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:05.760]   because I know how much love you put into it,
[03:30:05.760 --> 03:30:08.280]   how like, how much, I don't know.
[03:30:08.280 --> 03:30:11.760]   To me, for some reason that somehow would directly connect
[03:30:11.760 --> 03:30:13.880]   to huge views.
[03:30:13.880 --> 03:30:16.640]   But see, you know what made me sad is like,
[03:30:16.640 --> 03:30:18.960]   if you use a different thumbnail or a different title
[03:30:18.960 --> 03:30:21.120]   that could affect the popularity.
[03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:21.960]   - I know.
[03:30:21.960 --> 03:30:23.800]   - And then I just could imagine the torment
[03:30:23.800 --> 03:30:24.840]   you're going through.
[03:30:24.840 --> 03:30:27.320]   What if I use the different thumbnail?
[03:30:27.320 --> 03:30:30.640]   It's that Jimmy, the Mr. Beast torment,
[03:30:30.640 --> 03:30:34.040]   like just a slightly different title
[03:30:34.040 --> 03:30:37.000]   or slightly different, it could change everything.
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:40.240]   - I have videos, ironically, the last like,
[03:30:40.240 --> 03:30:41.880]   I don't know, five videos I've produced
[03:30:41.880 --> 03:30:43.760]   are horribly flopping.
[03:30:43.760 --> 03:30:45.680]   Like some of my worst videos I've ever made.
[03:30:45.680 --> 03:30:46.840]   - Statistically.
[03:30:46.840 --> 03:30:48.880]   - The interesting one is like the,
[03:30:48.880 --> 03:30:51.240]   you summarize, incredible video.
[03:30:51.240 --> 03:30:53.680]   You summarizing that people should go watch
[03:30:53.680 --> 03:30:57.040]   about all the awards video for 2022.
[03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:59.400]   Like all the cool stuff that happened in 2022.
[03:30:59.400 --> 03:31:00.880]   I remember that not being that popular.
[03:31:00.880 --> 03:31:03.120]   There's a few ones recently that are not that popular.
[03:31:03.120 --> 03:31:04.320]   - Like riding in a fighter jet.
[03:31:04.320 --> 03:31:08.360]   I thought that was gonna be easy, like one or two million.
[03:31:08.360 --> 03:31:11.600]   I don't know if I've paid the flights off to go there.
[03:31:11.600 --> 03:31:12.440]   You know what I mean?
[03:31:12.440 --> 03:31:13.360]   Like in that video.
[03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:14.880]   - It makes no sense.
[03:31:14.880 --> 03:31:18.400]   - And frankly, here's, at the end of the day,
[03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:20.920]   I realized like I have lately,
[03:31:20.920 --> 03:31:22.040]   especially the last like year or two,
[03:31:22.040 --> 03:31:24.200]   kind of disconnected from that aspect of it.
[03:31:24.200 --> 03:31:25.200]   I'm super fortunate.
[03:31:25.200 --> 03:31:27.440]   I have very generous like Patreon support
[03:31:27.440 --> 03:31:29.440]   and people that can help me sustain to produce.
[03:31:29.440 --> 03:31:32.760]   - People go support, support Tim on Patreon.
[03:31:32.760 --> 03:31:35.600]   - Well, it's that, but as you know, as a creator,
[03:31:35.600 --> 03:31:37.440]   like that is what keeps the lights on it
[03:31:37.440 --> 03:31:39.600]   and makes it so it, you know, I can go this deep.
[03:31:39.600 --> 03:31:40.520]   Like if I didn't have that,
[03:31:40.520 --> 03:31:43.960]   if I had to rely solely on like YouTube ad revenue,
[03:31:43.960 --> 03:31:46.680]   I mean, I would just, they'd be super different videos.
[03:31:46.680 --> 03:31:48.600]   I wouldn't spend as much time researching
[03:31:48.600 --> 03:31:49.440]   'cause I'd just, you know,
[03:31:49.440 --> 03:31:50.880]   they'd just be more glossed over.
[03:31:50.880 --> 03:31:52.560]   It's like a hurry to churn them out
[03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:54.480]   so I can keep the machine going.
[03:31:54.480 --> 03:31:57.400]   And I have this incredible freedom
[03:31:57.400 --> 03:31:59.360]   to really dive into a topic.
[03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:00.560]   Like a video that I've been working on now
[03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:03.600]   for almost three months is how to start a rocket engine.
[03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:06.960]   And let me tell you, it's not as easy as one might think,
[03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:09.760]   or I guess as it is as difficult as you might think.
[03:32:09.760 --> 03:32:11.880]   I mean, it's an insane topic.
[03:32:11.880 --> 03:32:12.920]   - And what do you mean by start?
[03:32:12.920 --> 03:32:13.960]   You mean like the ignition?
[03:32:13.960 --> 03:32:15.760]   - Yeah, like how do you physically get them running?
[03:32:15.760 --> 03:32:18.000]   You know, like there's all these, you know,
[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:20.520]   the valves and the turbine,
[03:32:20.520 --> 03:32:22.200]   the turbine, you know, that we were talking about earlier,
[03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:23.600]   like that has to run on the pumps,
[03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:25.840]   but it itself is powering the pumps.
[03:32:25.840 --> 03:32:27.400]   So how do you get that, like chicken and egg,
[03:32:27.400 --> 03:32:29.300]   how do you get that thing started?
[03:32:29.300 --> 03:32:31.480]   You know, there's tons of, it's so cool.
[03:32:31.480 --> 03:32:33.000]   There's so many ways.
[03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:35.800]   And so for me, you know, that required reading a lot
[03:32:35.800 --> 03:32:38.560]   and talking to people that know a lot more than me
[03:32:38.560 --> 03:32:42.000]   and just really trying to make sure I understand
[03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:44.520]   enough of it to explain it and try to weave a narrative,
[03:32:44.520 --> 03:32:47.180]   you know, and so that video is three months in the making.
[03:32:47.180 --> 03:32:50.080]   We're still probably another two or three weeks out.
[03:32:50.080 --> 03:32:51.280]   And it's, I don't expect, I mean,
[03:32:51.280 --> 03:32:53.740]   I think this one will do relatively well, you know,
[03:32:53.740 --> 03:32:55.200]   but in the grand scheme of YouTube,
[03:32:55.200 --> 03:32:57.660]   like still child's play, you know.
[03:32:57.660 --> 03:33:01.040]   But I'm okay, and I'm okay with that.
[03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:04.440]   I'm at that point actually where I am okay with that.
[03:33:04.440 --> 03:33:07.280]   It still stings and I'm more worried about just like,
[03:33:07.280 --> 03:33:11.320]   can I continue to do it at this quality and at this level
[03:33:11.320 --> 03:33:13.040]   if it's losing money, you know what I mean?
[03:33:13.040 --> 03:33:14.880]   So it's, there is a trade-off
[03:33:14.880 --> 03:33:17.360]   and I am kind of having to navigate that.
[03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:22.360]   - But you have sort of the depth of the impact you have
[03:33:22.360 --> 03:33:27.240]   is a thing that YouTube can't give you numbers on,
[03:33:27.240 --> 03:33:30.600]   but it's a really important thing to sort of remember
[03:33:30.600 --> 03:33:32.920]   that it's really not just about the YouTube numbers
[03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:37.920]   or it's for people like you that are basically educating
[03:33:39.280 --> 03:33:43.720]   and revealing the brilliance in a technology
[03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:47.900]   that will make humans a multi-planetary species
[03:33:47.900 --> 03:33:51.400]   and give hope to millions of young minds
[03:33:51.400 --> 03:33:53.200]   that will build that future.
[03:33:53.200 --> 03:33:54.680]   I mean, that's immeasurable.
[03:33:54.680 --> 03:33:56.060]   That's not just the views.
[03:33:56.060 --> 03:33:57.760]   (Lex laughing)
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:00.680]   But you know, it's, that's really important
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:03.520]   to sort of remember as you're creating it.
[03:34:03.520 --> 03:34:06.940]   That's something I try to think about as well.
[03:34:06.940 --> 03:34:08.040]   So like views.
[03:34:09.120 --> 03:34:11.200]   - Yeah, and that becomes more.
[03:34:11.200 --> 03:34:12.480]   - Don't matter.
[03:34:12.480 --> 03:34:14.360]   - I realize that more and more like every day,
[03:34:14.360 --> 03:34:16.800]   you know, the more the channel matures,
[03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:18.880]   the more I realize the importance of it
[03:34:18.880 --> 03:34:21.480]   as an overall mission, as opposed to like,
[03:34:21.480 --> 03:34:22.520]   you know, in the first year or two,
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:25.880]   it's a rat race of growth and popularity
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:27.020]   and all that kind of stuff, you know?
[03:34:27.020 --> 03:34:29.400]   And you feel that, you feel that it's a driving force.
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:30.880]   These days, not so much,
[03:34:30.880 --> 03:34:33.840]   just because that will wear you out very quickly.
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:37.400]   - So back to the Soviet rocket video, the epic video,
[03:34:37.400 --> 03:34:40.920]   probably the most epically researched video you've done.
[03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:44.320]   I mean, it's like, it's truly an epic video.
[03:34:44.320 --> 03:34:48.680]   So what, again, called the entire Soviet
[03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:51.200]   rocket engine family tree.
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:53.360]   Took you two years to research.
[03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:55.800]   What are some fascinating things you've learned
[03:34:55.800 --> 03:34:57.720]   about the history of rocket engines
[03:34:57.720 --> 03:35:02.200]   in the Soviet Union and in general
[03:35:02.200 --> 03:35:04.240]   through the process of making that video?
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:10.240]   - The coolest thing to me is how it's this weird blend
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:12.800]   for the Soviet Union went through
[03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:17.840]   an insane iteration process and made so many engines.
[03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:20.320]   Like I didn't even touch, you know,
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:22.400]   any like maneuvering thrusters or missile engines.
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:24.960]   Like I only really dealt with main propulsion engines
[03:35:24.960 --> 03:35:26.760]   on orbital rockets and there's still
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:27.880]   way too many to talk about.
[03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:30.480]   I mean, it's still dozens and dozens of engines.
[03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:33.440]   And I could have gone deeper into this, which is hilarious.
[03:35:34.720 --> 03:35:36.800]   They iterated so much, made a new engine
[03:35:36.800 --> 03:35:39.000]   for just at the drop of a hat,
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:43.320]   yet they still also like did super primitive things.
[03:35:43.320 --> 03:35:46.040]   You know, they physically are still today
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:47.880]   lighting the main combustion chambers
[03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:50.520]   of the Soyuz engines of the RD-107 and RD-108
[03:35:50.520 --> 03:35:52.120]   with essentially matchsticks.
[03:35:52.120 --> 03:35:55.000]   Like they literally stick a T-shaped thing
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:58.960]   up into the chamber and have a pyrotechnic in it
[03:35:58.960 --> 03:36:00.960]   that ignites the actual propellants
[03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:02.200]   in the combustion chamber.
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:04.640]   It's not the most elegant solution in the world.
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:05.600]   They're still using that.
[03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:09.000]   So they went from like the whole spectrum of like,
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:11.280]   it's a mixture of like make it better, faster,
[03:36:11.280 --> 03:36:13.880]   harder, stronger, gooder, all the way around
[03:36:13.880 --> 03:36:15.840]   to also if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:18.680]   It's like it employs all of the above.
[03:36:18.680 --> 03:36:21.520]   - So it's like it's a lot of innovation,
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:23.040]   but also they use duct tape.
[03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:24.960]   - Yes. - So like all of it together.
[03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:27.120]   - Yes, that's exactly like,
[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:28.480]   that's exactly the way to put it.
[03:36:28.480 --> 03:36:30.680]   And they did things that are insane.
[03:36:30.680 --> 03:36:33.360]   They developed a full flow stage combustion cycle engine.
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:35.480]   This engine, had it been used,
[03:36:35.480 --> 03:36:36.480]   I mean, it would have put the F,
[03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:40.120]   it was same relative size as the F1 engine on the Saturn V,
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:42.840]   like in that same category, way up there of like,
[03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:45.600]   you know, 6.7 like mega newtons of thrust
[03:36:45.600 --> 03:36:48.360]   or something around, and the F1 is like seven or something.
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:53.360]   It's huge, yet way more complicated, way more efficient,
[03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:56.720]   way just better engine in that sense,
[03:36:56.720 --> 03:36:59.560]   as far as performance goes, yet it never flew.
[03:36:59.560 --> 03:37:01.080]   It never left the stand.
[03:37:01.080 --> 03:37:03.640]   You know, they never built the rocket around it.
[03:37:03.640 --> 03:37:07.080]   The N1, which was the most powerful rocket
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:08.720]   to have flown so far to date,
[03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:13.120]   like it never made it through its first stage burn.
[03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:15.640]   It all four attempts failed spectacularly.
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:18.000]   And yet it had so much technology on it
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:20.560]   that was still unrivaled today almost.
[03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:22.640]   Like finally now we're beating it,
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:24.880]   the NK-33s that they developed for that rocket.
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:27.800]   Like finally today, we're to the point of like,
[03:37:27.800 --> 03:37:30.680]   having better engines than they built in the 60s.
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:32.320]   - Yeah, what stands out to you
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:35.720]   from the N1 family of rocket engines?
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:38.160]   - Well, it's interesting because the N1
[03:37:38.160 --> 03:37:40.560]   was the Kudsnetsov Design Bureau,
[03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:42.480]   and he was actually an aircraft manufacturer.
[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:44.040]   So he was one of the first people outside
[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:46.960]   of kind of the missile and rocket program.
[03:37:46.960 --> 03:37:49.000]   You know, he had all these other bigwigs
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:50.800]   kind of in the other OKBs
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:52.520]   that were developing missiles and rockets.
[03:37:52.520 --> 03:37:55.000]   And then all of a sudden here comes Nikolai Kudsnetsov,
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:58.560]   who had never developed a rocket engine.
[03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:00.520]   And so his first attempt at a rocket engines
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:03.360]   was the NK series, NK-15, NK-33.
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:04.560]   And they were amazing.
[03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:05.520]   They were brilliant.
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:08.640]   They were these wonderful closed cycle oxygen rich engines
[03:38:08.640 --> 03:38:11.280]   that were awesome.
[03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:12.440]   They were awesome engines.
[03:38:12.440 --> 03:38:14.640]   And that were, you know, because,
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:19.640]   I love that because his direct boss,
[03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:21.800]   since he wasn't necessarily in the aerospace,
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:23.280]   you know, or in the, I guess,
[03:38:23.280 --> 03:38:25.440]   the rocket missile defense world,
[03:38:25.440 --> 03:38:29.040]   he didn't have to, at the fall of the Soviet Union,
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:31.040]   he didn't have to give away all of his things
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:33.360]   to the same people as the other people.
[03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:37.240]   So he hid, you know, like 80 of his engines in a hangar.
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:42.240]   And then we still literally use them in the United States.
[03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:45.240]   We used altogether, I think it was like eight or 10 of them,
[03:38:45.240 --> 03:38:48.560]   repurposed them as, they're called AJ-26s
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:49.400]   in the United States.
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:51.920]   But like, we still were flying Soviet rocket engines
[03:38:51.920 --> 03:38:54.800]   in the 2000s because they were better
[03:38:54.800 --> 03:38:57.440]   than engines we are building today.
[03:38:57.440 --> 03:39:00.720]   Like that's, to me, that's my favorite fact
[03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:04.360]   about the N1 rocket engines is that they're still that good.
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:06.400]   That they were the best choice for,
[03:39:06.400 --> 03:39:08.520]   at the time, orbital sciences.
[03:39:08.520 --> 03:39:12.400]   - Some of the culture that engineering has led
[03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:15.680]   to these things that still work, it's incredible.
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:18.880]   You said that the RD-171 is one of the coolest engines
[03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:20.680]   ever made, why is that?
[03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:24.680]   - Yeah, so one of the fun things about the Soviet engines
[03:39:24.680 --> 03:39:26.360]   is it'll look like, a lot of their engines
[03:39:26.360 --> 03:39:29.160]   look like multiple engines 'cause you see multiple nozzles.
[03:39:29.160 --> 03:39:31.640]   You see multiple combustion chambers and you would think,
[03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:35.320]   well, obviously, the nozzle is the engine, right?
[03:39:35.320 --> 03:39:39.520]   But what they actually would do, the real heart
[03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:42.040]   and the real power of the rocket engine
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:43.320]   actually comes from the turbo pumps,
[03:39:43.320 --> 03:39:45.400]   comes from the pumps themselves.
[03:39:45.400 --> 03:39:48.280]   And as we talked about earlier, that includes the turbine
[03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:51.600]   and the actual pumps that flow the propellant
[03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:53.280]   into the chambers.
[03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:57.760]   And so, the Soviet Union was incredible at developing
[03:39:57.760 --> 03:40:00.560]   these closed cycle, high powered turbo pumps.
[03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:03.960]   But if you try to scale the combustion chamber too big,
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:07.280]   you end up with what's called combustion instability.
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:12.280]   You have such a large surface area of crazy flames
[03:40:12.280 --> 03:40:16.120]   and combustion happening, they can get these weird pockets
[03:40:16.120 --> 03:40:19.120]   and oscillations and frequencies and they just couldn't
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:21.400]   make big combustion chambers, they never figured it out.
[03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:23.480]   They never quite, well, they did actually kind of figure it
[03:40:23.480 --> 03:40:25.680]   out, but they didn't like it.
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:28.940]   So, they ended up just shrinking down and having small
[03:40:28.940 --> 03:40:32.120]   combustion chambers and just splitting the pipes basically.
[03:40:32.120 --> 03:40:35.320]   Instead of one fuel pump going into, or one pipe going
[03:40:35.320 --> 03:40:38.400]   into one combustion chamber and one oxidizer pipe going
[03:40:38.400 --> 03:40:41.040]   into one combustion chamber, they'd split it off
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:45.520]   into two or four combustion chambers and kind of spread
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:47.840]   that work around so they didn't experience
[03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:49.700]   this combustion instability.
[03:40:49.700 --> 03:40:53.360]   So, the RD-171 is still to date the most powerful
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:55.140]   rocket engine ever built.
[03:40:55.140 --> 03:40:58.120]   The turbo pump is insane, I don't even remember how many,
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:00.440]   you know, like 200,000 horsepower or something comes out
[03:41:00.440 --> 03:41:03.660]   of that turbo pump, in order to flow the amount of propellant
[03:41:03.660 --> 03:41:06.020]   necessary at those rates and at those pressures
[03:41:06.020 --> 03:41:06.860]   into the combustion chamber.
[03:41:06.860 --> 03:41:10.740]   So, it has four chambers and it's just an absolute marvel
[03:41:10.740 --> 03:41:11.640]   of engineering.
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:14.980]   And yeah, and then the cool thing too is specifically
[03:41:14.980 --> 03:41:18.880]   the RD-171, it's engine, all four of those nozzles
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:22.120]   can actually pivot and rotate.
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:26.580]   I just now, as I'm explaining this, realized that has to mean
[03:41:26.580 --> 03:41:31.100]   that they have joints, like flexible joints,
[03:41:31.100 --> 03:41:34.980]   in the high pressure pump lines in order to,
[03:41:34.980 --> 03:41:37.860]   like I never, this is the realization I'm having right now,
[03:41:37.860 --> 03:41:41.040]   'cause normally you put the gimbal above the turbo pump,
[03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:43.460]   like the mount where the engine swivels,
[03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:46.020]   so that you have low pressure coming from the tanks
[03:41:46.020 --> 03:41:47.180]   into the pumps.
[03:41:47.180 --> 03:41:50.080]   And then you just have a straight, you know, fixed pipe
[03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:51.660]   flowing into the engine, so you don't have to bend
[03:41:51.660 --> 03:41:53.720]   that pipe and have it be dynamic.
[03:41:53.720 --> 03:41:56.780]   If they had the four chambers moving independently
[03:41:56.780 --> 03:41:58.940]   from each other, that means those four chambers
[03:41:58.940 --> 03:42:02.300]   all had to have a flexible high pressure pipe going,
[03:42:02.300 --> 03:42:04.920]   which I don't even, I don't know if that's,
[03:42:04.920 --> 03:42:06.360]   why am I just now realizing this?
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:08.820]   - Yeah, so there's engineering challenges with that.
[03:42:08.820 --> 03:42:11.680]   - Insane, I never even thought that was a thing
[03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:13.840]   you would ever, could do, honestly.
[03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:16.240]   I would, I gotta look into why and how and what and where.
[03:42:16.240 --> 03:42:19.320]   - Yeah, I wonder why that design decision was made.
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:21.080]   - So the easier thing to do normally
[03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:23.040]   is you would keep those nozzles fixed,
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:25.400]   then affix, like say the Soyuz engine,
[03:42:25.400 --> 03:42:27.680]   the RD-107 and 108, they have affixed
[03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:30.360]   main combustion chambers and they use these little
[03:42:30.360 --> 03:42:32.800]   Vernier, or some people got mad at me for saying
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:35.960]   Vernier and Vernor engines that swivel themselves
[03:42:35.960 --> 03:42:38.460]   and those provide your control authority.
[03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:40.640]   So the main chambers stay fixed and then you get
[03:42:40.640 --> 03:42:42.280]   your roll and your pitch and your yaw
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:44.480]   out of auxiliary thrusters.
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:47.160]   - By the way, did you get anything wrong in that video?
[03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:48.360]   That people told you about?
[03:42:48.360 --> 03:42:50.320]   - Yeah, I got a few things, yep.
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:53.440]   First off, we had a graphic error where we actually,
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:56.700]   we copied and pasted a lot of our After Effects projects.
[03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:59.200]   So our nuclear engines, one of them on screen
[03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:01.240]   says that it runs on RP-1, it does not.
[03:43:01.240 --> 03:43:03.040]   It has basically all the wrong stats.
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:04.480]   We just didn't catch it in the edit,
[03:43:04.480 --> 03:43:06.600]   that we literally copy and pasted it.
[03:43:06.600 --> 03:43:08.960]   I say it right on screen, but the,
[03:43:08.960 --> 03:43:11.320]   in the voiceover, but on screen it's wrong.
[03:43:11.320 --> 03:43:13.560]   The other thing, and I'm excited to ask you about this.
[03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:14.400]   - Uh-oh.
[03:43:14.400 --> 03:43:16.160]   - First, and I spoke with a lot of
[03:43:16.160 --> 03:43:17.360]   Russian-speaking individuals.
[03:43:17.360 --> 03:43:18.800]   We had a lot of research assistants
[03:43:18.800 --> 03:43:20.640]   that were reading and blah, blah, blah.
[03:43:20.640 --> 03:43:23.080]   I tried really hard to learn how to pronounce
[03:43:23.080 --> 03:43:26.100]   Sergei Karelyov's name.
[03:43:26.100 --> 03:43:29.360]   And I'm still gonna say it wrong no matter what I,
[03:43:29.360 --> 03:43:33.240]   but my understanding, and from listening to native speakers,
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:37.160]   is closer to Karelyov than it is Korolev.
[03:43:37.160 --> 03:43:38.120]   - Yeah, definitely.
[03:43:38.120 --> 03:43:40.720]   Sergei Pavlovich Karelyov.
[03:43:40.720 --> 03:43:42.360]   - See, I will never say it that perfectly,
[03:43:42.360 --> 03:43:44.160]   but I know it's not just Korelev.
[03:43:44.160 --> 03:43:47.600]   I mean, again, the English translation of it,
[03:43:47.600 --> 03:43:49.320]   likely I should have just said Korelev
[03:43:49.320 --> 03:43:53.320]   and said I'm saying it the dumb America way, but.
[03:43:53.320 --> 03:43:56.160]   - But you rolled your R, comrade.
[03:43:56.160 --> 03:43:58.160]   (laughing)
[03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:02.240]   Excellent, so let me just ask you in a difference
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:04.560]   in the culture, because you've researched so many rockets
[03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:06.760]   from so many different eras, the Saturn V,
[03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:09.400]   and just everything you're seeing now.
[03:44:09.400 --> 03:44:11.500]   Are there some interesting differences,
[03:44:11.500 --> 03:44:13.540]   especially when you look at the space race,
[03:44:13.540 --> 03:44:18.200]   between the Soviet rocket engineers
[03:44:18.200 --> 03:44:20.580]   and efforts versus the American?
[03:44:20.580 --> 03:44:25.960]   - The, there's, I mean, there's definitely huge,
[03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:28.480]   huge cultural changes, and the fun thing is
[03:44:28.480 --> 03:44:31.120]   that they kind of spawned from the same,
[03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:32.880]   like they have the same starting place.
[03:44:32.880 --> 03:44:36.200]   Both, you know, the Soviet rocket engines and Americans
[03:44:36.200 --> 03:44:40.220]   all came from the Nazi V-2 rocket and the A-4 engine.
[03:44:40.220 --> 03:44:42.020]   Literally, physically spawned from that,
[03:44:42.020 --> 03:44:45.040]   because at the fall of, you know, at the end of World War II
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:46.760]   we took a handful of German scientists
[03:44:46.760 --> 03:44:49.160]   and the Soviets took a handful of German scientists,
[03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:51.440]   and they both got their own a little bit,
[03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:52.680]   some blueprints here and there,
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:53.760]   and the others got some blueprints.
[03:44:53.760 --> 03:44:55.960]   So we literally have the same, it's a weird thing,
[03:44:55.960 --> 03:44:58.000]   where we're starting from the same, like, thing
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:00.400]   and letting two divergent, you know,
[03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:03.220]   divergent paths go crazy on their own development.
[03:45:03.220 --> 03:45:05.740]   So it's really fun to see the cultural differences.
[03:45:05.740 --> 03:45:07.240]   One of the things the United States did is
[03:45:07.240 --> 03:45:10.120]   they really would kind of take an engine
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:12.920]   and just perfect it more or less,
[03:45:12.920 --> 03:45:15.640]   and then, and not really evolve that much.
[03:45:15.640 --> 03:45:18.680]   Like, they, I don't know, and I don't know why.
[03:45:18.680 --> 03:45:20.280]   I actually need to do a history lesson
[03:45:20.280 --> 03:45:23.080]   on all of the US engines, but it's literally like,
[03:45:23.080 --> 03:45:26.720]   as far as orbital class engines before now,
[03:45:26.720 --> 03:45:29.080]   I mean, it's like a dozen or two, you know,
[03:45:29.080 --> 03:45:32.840]   it's a tenth the amount of the Soviets,
[03:45:32.840 --> 03:45:35.600]   and the Soviets just literally made up a new engine
[03:45:35.600 --> 03:45:37.960]   every time they had a new, like, they went,
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:40.880]   and it was like a completely different engine.
[03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:42.960]   - Yeah. - So I just, yeah.
[03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:44.960]   - I wonder if there's some aspect to the culture,
[03:45:44.960 --> 03:45:46.400]   and I don't want to overstate it,
[03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:49.080]   but there is more of a safety culture,
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:51.160]   I think, in the United States.
[03:45:51.160 --> 03:45:53.400]   And I think if you care about safety,
[03:45:53.400 --> 03:45:58.400]   or rather, like, you have, you're more risk-averse,
[03:45:58.400 --> 03:46:00.480]   so you care about safety more,
[03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:03.080]   about the value of human life and the risk taken there,
[03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:06.400]   that you will iterate less.
[03:46:06.400 --> 03:46:07.920]   So I think the Soviets,
[03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:09.960]   especially in the early aspects of the program,
[03:46:09.960 --> 03:46:12.160]   I don't want to overstate this,
[03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:14.880]   some of it is just through stories,
[03:46:14.880 --> 03:46:16.640]   you just hear anecdotes,
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:19.360]   they're more willing to take risks.
[03:46:19.360 --> 03:46:20.740]   - Yeah. - Risk with human life,
[03:46:20.740 --> 03:46:22.320]   risk with spacecraft.
[03:46:22.320 --> 03:46:25.840]   - For example, the first orbital space flights
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:29.000]   from the Soviet Union, the cosmonaut had to eject
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.200]   out of the capsule and parachute to a landing.
[03:46:31.200 --> 03:46:33.720]   - Yes. - That's not very well known,
[03:46:33.720 --> 03:46:36.480]   and it wasn't, they hid that even from history
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:37.680]   as best they could at first,
[03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:39.200]   because they were slightly ashamed
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:40.760]   that they couldn't have a full recovery system
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:41.920]   with their spacecraft.
[03:46:41.920 --> 03:46:43.120]   They could physically recover it,
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:44.160]   but they wouldn't have been able to recover
[03:46:44.160 --> 03:46:46.060]   the cosmonaut in one piece.
[03:46:46.060 --> 03:46:49.400]   So instead, they had them just eject out of the thing
[03:46:49.400 --> 03:46:52.320]   and parachute to safety, like, that's insane.
[03:46:52.320 --> 03:46:56.640]   And so there definitely was some extra risks,
[03:46:56.640 --> 03:46:59.340]   but also a freedom to just push things to the limits
[03:46:59.340 --> 03:47:00.560]   and try everything.
[03:47:00.560 --> 03:47:03.420]   They threw all the spaghetti on the wall.
[03:47:03.420 --> 03:47:05.840]   It's funny that most people probably don't even know
[03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:07.960]   the first person in space in America,
[03:47:07.960 --> 03:47:09.800]   and obviously everybody knows that.
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:16.120]   It's like, it's kind of interesting how the space race,
[03:47:16.120 --> 03:47:22.200]   and even World War II, even like the history books,
[03:47:22.200 --> 03:47:23.880]   you ask most Americans,
[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:28.560]   they think that America won World War II.
[03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:31.040]   Like, without America, like,
[03:47:31.700 --> 03:47:34.820]   the real heroes of World War II is America.
[03:47:34.820 --> 03:47:37.900]   You ask British people, they say,
[03:47:37.900 --> 03:47:40.500]   and everybody has a pretty good justification,
[03:47:40.500 --> 03:47:43.660]   like, without Britain, without Churchill,
[03:47:43.660 --> 03:47:46.220]   Hitler would have taken over the world.
[03:47:46.220 --> 03:47:49.860]   And I think probably the strongest case
[03:47:49.860 --> 03:47:51.460]   is the Soviet Union case,
[03:47:51.460 --> 03:47:53.340]   that they're the ones that won the war.
[03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:54.740]   The reason it's the strongest case
[03:47:54.740 --> 03:47:57.300]   is where most of the fighting happened.
[03:47:57.300 --> 03:47:59.260]   Most of the death happened.
[03:47:59.260 --> 03:48:00.900]   Most of the destruction.
[03:48:00.900 --> 03:48:02.620]   But everyone has their perspective.
[03:48:02.620 --> 03:48:04.300]   And certainly in the space race,
[03:48:04.300 --> 03:48:08.460]   the great accomplishment is the first man on the moon,
[03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:09.700]   from the US perspective.
[03:48:09.700 --> 03:48:10.540]   - Yeah, I was gonna say.
[03:48:10.540 --> 03:48:13.660]   - And then Yuri Gagarin, from the Russian perspective,
[03:48:13.660 --> 03:48:15.260]   is the first man in space.
[03:48:15.260 --> 03:48:16.860]   And that, I think, still persists.
[03:48:16.860 --> 03:48:19.460]   And some of that, in healthy forms,
[03:48:19.460 --> 03:48:22.740]   is probably constructive to a little bit of competition
[03:48:22.740 --> 03:48:26.260]   that pushes all the great scientists on each side.
[03:48:26.260 --> 03:48:28.020]   But anyway, what do you think about
[03:48:28.900 --> 03:48:32.140]   this Yuri Gagarin mission of the first human in space?
[03:48:32.140 --> 03:48:35.820]   And the Vostok mission in 1961?
[03:48:35.820 --> 03:48:38.340]   Just in general, when you look back at that time,
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:42.940]   leading to the first man on the moon.
[03:48:42.940 --> 03:48:45.300]   - Yeah, April 12th, 1961.
[03:48:45.300 --> 03:48:46.140]   Yuri's night, baby.
[03:48:46.140 --> 03:48:48.900]   That's a, yeah, it's insane.
[03:48:48.900 --> 03:48:53.460]   What's insane to me is the first person in space
[03:48:53.460 --> 03:48:56.740]   didn't just go to space, he went into orbit.
[03:48:56.740 --> 03:49:00.900]   Yuri Gagarin flew around the Earth in orbit and reentered.
[03:49:00.900 --> 03:49:04.500]   That's a monumental task compared to suborbital.
[03:49:04.500 --> 03:49:07.580]   So the United States did two suborbital flights
[03:49:07.580 --> 03:49:09.140]   in that same year, I believe in that same year,
[03:49:09.140 --> 03:49:11.300]   at least I'm pretty sure, in 1961.
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:14.220]   They flew for the first time orbitally in 1962.
[03:49:14.220 --> 03:49:15.940]   So they weren't terribly far behind
[03:49:15.940 --> 03:49:16.860]   to get a human into orbit.
[03:49:16.860 --> 03:49:18.140]   Like in the grand scheme of things,
[03:49:18.140 --> 03:49:19.660]   10 months difference.
[03:49:19.660 --> 03:49:21.580]   But at the same time, the fact that the Soviet Union
[03:49:21.580 --> 03:49:23.860]   just went straight to flying someone into orbit
[03:49:23.860 --> 03:49:25.540]   is monumental.
[03:49:25.540 --> 03:49:28.700]   And I'm sure they did not do excessive,
[03:49:28.700 --> 03:49:30.660]   rigorous testing here.
[03:49:30.660 --> 03:49:32.260]   Because there is a space race,
[03:49:32.260 --> 03:49:34.780]   and you have the first is important.
[03:49:34.780 --> 03:49:36.340]   Just imagine being Yuri.
[03:49:36.340 --> 03:49:39.540]   What do you say when they're like launching him,
[03:49:39.540 --> 03:49:40.900]   like let's go or something?
[03:49:40.900 --> 03:49:44.420]   Like, I mean, you're taking,
[03:49:44.420 --> 03:49:46.020]   we're talking about you being on Starship.
[03:49:46.020 --> 03:49:48.700]   Like you're taking a pretty big risk
[03:49:48.700 --> 03:49:52.060]   being launched out into orbit.
[03:49:52.060 --> 03:49:55.020]   - Hopefully a lot less risk than what Yuri went through.
[03:49:55.020 --> 03:49:57.500]   - So Yuri, the crazy thing,
[03:49:57.500 --> 03:49:59.940]   remember those matchsticks we talked about?
[03:49:59.940 --> 03:50:03.300]   You know, there's 20 main combustion chambers on Soyuz,
[03:50:03.300 --> 03:50:08.020]   and there's four, and 12 more Vernier engines
[03:50:08.020 --> 03:50:09.420]   that all need to be lit.
[03:50:09.420 --> 03:50:11.980]   So you're sitting on top of this booster,
[03:50:11.980 --> 03:50:13.100]   and they light all of those,
[03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:16.220]   32 combustion chambers on the ground.
[03:50:16.220 --> 03:50:19.180]   And then it has this insane separation process
[03:50:19.180 --> 03:50:20.900]   between what the Soviet Union would call
[03:50:20.900 --> 03:50:22.220]   the first stage and the second stages,
[03:50:22.260 --> 03:50:25.300]   but we would call it like the core stage and the boosters.
[03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:28.420]   They all, four of these boosters have to peel away perfectly
[03:50:28.420 --> 03:50:30.940]   from the core stage simultaneously.
[03:50:30.940 --> 03:50:33.500]   You know, if one of them sticks on, mission failed.
[03:50:33.500 --> 03:50:35.700]   If one of them doesn't eject properly
[03:50:35.700 --> 03:50:39.380]   and drags into the other tank, you know, it's a goner.
[03:50:39.380 --> 03:50:43.740]   So the staging process of the Soyuz is insane to me
[03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:45.980]   that that ended up working out.
[03:50:45.980 --> 03:50:50.420]   It's just the technology in Soyuz,
[03:50:50.420 --> 03:50:52.940]   I mean, more or less, that same rocket
[03:50:52.940 --> 03:50:57.940]   is what's still flying humans that are cosmonauts
[03:50:57.940 --> 03:51:01.140]   from Roscosmos and going to the International Space Station
[03:51:01.140 --> 03:51:04.020]   are flying on a variant of that Soyuz rocket still today.
[03:51:04.020 --> 03:51:07.860]   It's still like that big of a workhorse.
[03:51:07.860 --> 03:51:11.940]   - What do you think about Roscosmos as it stands today,
[03:51:11.940 --> 03:51:16.940]   its history and its future in comparison to NASA
[03:51:17.540 --> 03:51:19.460]   and other national efforts
[03:51:19.460 --> 03:51:22.020]   and in comparison to commercial spaceflight?
[03:51:22.020 --> 03:51:25.740]   - I mean, utmost respect for the engineers involved
[03:51:25.740 --> 03:51:27.100]   in everything that's happened.
[03:51:27.100 --> 03:51:29.380]   I think Energomash is like still some of the,
[03:51:29.380 --> 03:51:31.620]   one of the greatest engine manufacturers
[03:51:31.620 --> 03:51:33.100]   when they have the funding to do so,
[03:51:33.100 --> 03:51:36.660]   but man, it seems like they're falling from grace
[03:51:36.660 --> 03:51:38.500]   as far as space prowess.
[03:51:38.500 --> 03:51:41.660]   You know, the Roscosmos went from having,
[03:51:41.660 --> 03:51:43.340]   I think they got very comfortable at the top of,
[03:51:43.340 --> 03:51:47.740]   you know, from 2011 until 2022 or until 2020,
[03:51:47.740 --> 03:51:48.820]   they were the only ride
[03:51:48.820 --> 03:51:51.500]   to the International Space Station since then.
[03:51:51.500 --> 03:51:54.620]   Like it started, I feel like in 2018,
[03:51:54.620 --> 03:51:56.340]   honestly, I think that's kind of when things,
[03:51:56.340 --> 03:51:58.180]   that's the first time I specifically remember
[03:51:58.180 --> 03:52:01.260]   a pretty nasty like thing happened in 2018.
[03:52:01.260 --> 03:52:03.540]   I think it was a Soyuz mission
[03:52:03.540 --> 03:52:04.700]   to the International Space Station,
[03:52:04.700 --> 03:52:06.660]   had one of the boosters not detached
[03:52:06.660 --> 03:52:10.420]   and had to have an abort, but you know, that happened.
[03:52:10.420 --> 03:52:12.340]   Then all of a sudden, next thing you know,
[03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:14.540]   there's a Progress being docked to the ISS
[03:52:14.540 --> 03:52:16.260]   a couple of years ago that spun the ISS,
[03:52:16.260 --> 03:52:18.180]   cartwheeled the ISS out of control,
[03:52:18.180 --> 03:52:19.460]   followed a few months later,
[03:52:19.460 --> 03:52:22.220]   the Pirs module docks to the International Space Station,
[03:52:22.220 --> 03:52:24.860]   spirals the International Space Station out of control again
[03:52:24.860 --> 03:52:27.340]   with like a thruster getting fixed on.
[03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:31.660]   There was a hole in a Russian segment.
[03:52:31.660 --> 03:52:33.820]   There's, well, I think the most recent one right now,
[03:52:33.820 --> 03:52:36.700]   there's a Soyuz docked to the ISS that has a puncture in it
[03:52:36.700 --> 03:52:38.500]   and it's leaking coolant
[03:52:38.500 --> 03:52:40.980]   and will not be returning humans on it.
[03:52:40.980 --> 03:52:43.900]   So they're actually having to fly up an uncrewed Soyuz.
[03:52:43.900 --> 03:52:46.340]   And that one likely wasn't a manufacturing error.
[03:52:46.340 --> 03:52:48.540]   It probably was like a micrometeorite puncture
[03:52:48.540 --> 03:52:50.140]   rendering the spacecraft unusable.
[03:52:50.140 --> 03:52:51.500]   We don't know for sure yet,
[03:52:51.500 --> 03:52:54.900]   but it's just really been like this fall from grace
[03:52:54.900 --> 03:52:58.660]   where they have all the potential.
[03:52:58.660 --> 03:52:59.700]   They have some of the best engines,
[03:52:59.700 --> 03:53:01.460]   some of the best rockets,
[03:53:01.460 --> 03:53:04.020]   and especially like right before
[03:53:04.020 --> 03:53:05.460]   the collapse of the Soviet Union,
[03:53:05.460 --> 03:53:10.100]   the Buran shuttle and the Energia rocket were incredible.
[03:53:10.100 --> 03:53:12.260]   Had they been able to evolve that into Buran-2
[03:53:12.260 --> 03:53:13.820]   and the reusable Energia?
[03:53:13.820 --> 03:53:16.980]   They had a fully reusable Energia on the drawing board.
[03:53:16.980 --> 03:53:20.900]   And like, I honestly fully think they could have done it.
[03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:22.740]   - Is it possible to return to a place
[03:53:22.740 --> 03:53:25.100]   where there is friendly competition between nations
[03:53:25.100 --> 03:53:30.100]   that ultimately unites and inspires the peoples
[03:53:30.100 --> 03:53:31.540]   of these different worlds,
[03:53:31.540 --> 03:53:34.060]   these very different worlds that have,
[03:53:34.060 --> 03:53:36.700]   especially recently come to conflict
[03:53:36.700 --> 03:53:38.540]   over the war in Ukraine.
[03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:43.180]   The tension builds, the war, the conflict, the suffering
[03:53:43.180 --> 03:53:45.700]   is actually creating more and more division,
[03:53:45.700 --> 03:53:47.260]   creating more and more hate.
[03:53:47.260 --> 03:53:48.620]   I think as we've talked about,
[03:53:48.620 --> 03:53:50.380]   I think science and engineering,
[03:53:50.380 --> 03:53:52.780]   and especially the most epic version of engineering,
[03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:57.260]   which is rocketry and space travel, unites people.
[03:53:57.260 --> 03:54:01.260]   Unites people even in a time of tension, conflict, and war.
[03:54:01.260 --> 03:54:05.420]   So do you have a hope that we can return to that place?
[03:54:06.300 --> 03:54:09.540]   - I think historically, space flight has been
[03:54:09.540 --> 03:54:11.700]   one of the most bonding things.
[03:54:11.700 --> 03:54:13.820]   We look at, we have countless examples
[03:54:13.820 --> 03:54:16.180]   of Cold War enemies coming together
[03:54:16.180 --> 03:54:18.500]   and working together, lending a hand.
[03:54:18.500 --> 03:54:21.660]   Apollo 13, for example, of course,
[03:54:21.660 --> 03:54:23.740]   there is the potential that who knew
[03:54:23.740 --> 03:54:25.820]   where it was gonna reenter since it was not
[03:54:25.820 --> 03:54:28.380]   in the planned trajectory at all for reentry.
[03:54:28.380 --> 03:54:31.980]   And the Soviet Union said, "Hey, wherever they land,
[03:54:31.980 --> 03:54:33.620]   "we'll help you guys out," basically.
[03:54:33.620 --> 03:54:37.300]   And that was a pretty big thing at the time, obviously.
[03:54:37.300 --> 03:54:40.620]   We also, in 1975, saw the Apollo-Soyuz mission,
[03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:42.500]   which was an Apollo spacecraft docking
[03:54:42.500 --> 03:54:44.540]   with the Soyuz spacecraft.
[03:54:44.540 --> 03:54:46.740]   First time there was international collaboration.
[03:54:46.740 --> 03:54:51.420]   And again, 1975, still very, amidst the Cold War,
[03:54:51.420 --> 03:54:54.580]   yet we have this collaboration that I don't know
[03:54:54.580 --> 03:54:56.340]   what else could have done that.
[03:54:56.340 --> 03:54:58.580]   I mean, and think about what it actually takes to do that.
[03:54:58.580 --> 03:55:00.980]   You have to come up with a docking module
[03:55:00.980 --> 03:55:04.860]   that takes the two different air environments
[03:55:04.860 --> 03:55:06.220]   and the two different docking systems
[03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:08.740]   and talk to the engineers and mission planners
[03:55:08.740 --> 03:55:10.780]   and figure out, train together,
[03:55:10.780 --> 03:55:13.300]   the cosmonauts and the astronauts trained together
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:14.140]   and got to know each other.
[03:55:14.140 --> 03:55:16.420]   They were crossing boundaries and borders
[03:55:16.420 --> 03:55:17.860]   and coming together for this mission.
[03:55:17.860 --> 03:55:20.300]   And even if it was totally a fluff piece,
[03:55:20.300 --> 03:55:24.500]   like even if it was totally this cynical,
[03:55:24.500 --> 03:55:27.780]   just trying to make a pretty face for everybody,
[03:55:27.780 --> 03:55:29.620]   for the cameras or something,
[03:55:29.620 --> 03:55:31.420]   obviously it still had an impact.
[03:55:31.420 --> 03:55:33.540]   - Yeah, the symbolic impact.
[03:55:33.540 --> 03:55:35.020]   But there's also the practical impact.
[03:55:35.020 --> 03:55:37.140]   I mean, a lot of people have to work together.
[03:55:37.140 --> 03:55:37.980]   - Yes.
[03:55:37.980 --> 03:55:40.420]   - And that has a ripple effect on the culture,
[03:55:40.420 --> 03:55:41.880]   on the different engineers.
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:44.380]   - Yeah, 100%.
[03:55:44.380 --> 03:55:47.660]   And even just the astronauts and the cosmonauts involved,
[03:55:47.660 --> 03:55:50.060]   think about what probably went through their heads
[03:55:50.060 --> 03:55:52.060]   during this process of going from,
[03:55:52.060 --> 03:55:53.900]   oh my God, I'm gonna have to work with them
[03:55:53.900 --> 03:55:58.220]   to getting to know them and then sharing meals in space.
[03:55:58.220 --> 03:56:01.660]   That's a crazy transformation of timelines.
[03:56:01.660 --> 03:56:04.940]   And I would love, I do think that space flight
[03:56:04.940 --> 03:56:07.140]   has the ability to bond us and unite us
[03:56:07.140 --> 03:56:09.220]   because it is ultimately,
[03:56:09.220 --> 03:56:12.120]   this little tiny little planet we're floating around on,
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:15.380]   it is the boundary that we all share.
[03:56:15.380 --> 03:56:19.420]   It only takes you getting off this planet to realize,
[03:56:19.420 --> 03:56:21.380]   oh my God, we're all neighbors.
[03:56:21.380 --> 03:56:23.660]   We're all living in the same house together.
[03:56:23.660 --> 03:56:26.780]   And I do think ultimately,
[03:56:26.780 --> 03:56:29.540]   as we continue to expand our horizons
[03:56:29.540 --> 03:56:30.540]   and expand our exploration,
[03:56:30.540 --> 03:56:33.540]   that it has the potential to unite us more
[03:56:33.540 --> 03:56:35.980]   than it has the potential to divide us.
[03:56:35.980 --> 03:56:40.260]   - So one of the potential conflicts of the 21st century
[03:56:40.260 --> 03:56:44.020]   that I think everyone wants to avoid,
[03:56:44.020 --> 03:56:46.660]   both in the cyber space and in the hot war space,
[03:56:46.660 --> 03:56:48.940]   cold war, hot war, all kinds of war,
[03:56:48.940 --> 03:56:51.360]   all kinds of economic conflict,
[03:56:51.360 --> 03:56:53.600]   this was between the United States and China.
[03:56:54.780 --> 03:56:58.660]   So China is going full steam ahead
[03:56:58.660 --> 03:57:00.660]   in developing a space program,
[03:57:00.660 --> 03:57:02.740]   doing a lot of incredible work.
[03:57:02.740 --> 03:57:07.740]   Like you mentioned, 64 launches in 2022 with two failures,
[03:57:07.740 --> 03:57:11.540]   but moving straight ahead.
[03:57:11.540 --> 03:57:13.220]   - And by the way, those failures,
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:14.540]   we had a lot of startups.
[03:57:14.540 --> 03:57:17.060]   Like a lot of the launches were from brand new companies.
[03:57:17.060 --> 03:57:19.620]   So to have two failures out of 64,
[03:57:19.620 --> 03:57:20.940]   I mean, that's still an impressive,
[03:57:20.940 --> 03:57:23.780]   if you look at operational launches, it was flawless.
[03:57:24.780 --> 03:57:28.740]   - Do you see a pathway where there's, again,
[03:57:28.740 --> 03:57:32.980]   in that same way, collaboration or a friendly competition
[03:57:32.980 --> 03:57:37.300]   between all the different companies and nations
[03:57:37.300 --> 03:57:40.500]   in the United States and China in the next,
[03:57:40.500 --> 03:57:45.500]   as we push towards the moon, Mars and beyond?
[03:57:45.500 --> 03:57:49.540]   - I held a dumb hope that China would actually be allowed
[03:57:49.540 --> 03:57:51.300]   to sign onto the Artemis Accord
[03:57:51.300 --> 03:57:55.220]   to be able to take part in this next step towards the moon.
[03:57:55.220 --> 03:57:59.420]   I mean, just imagine if they provided a propulsion module
[03:57:59.420 --> 03:58:00.380]   or a lander or something,
[03:58:00.380 --> 03:58:02.780]   and we actually came together to land on the moon
[03:58:02.780 --> 03:58:04.820]   instead of having another space race.
[03:58:04.820 --> 03:58:06.940]   It's like, it would have been so cool.
[03:58:06.940 --> 03:58:11.940]   And yeah, I still am hopeful that similar
[03:58:11.940 --> 03:58:14.380]   to back in the Cold War,
[03:58:14.380 --> 03:58:16.700]   that we might have something like that someday
[03:58:16.700 --> 03:58:18.580]   where we actually are collaborating.
[03:58:18.580 --> 03:58:20.700]   And it feels like sometimes we're really close to that.
[03:58:20.700 --> 03:58:22.980]   And then other times it feels like we're really far
[03:58:22.980 --> 03:58:23.820]   from that.
[03:58:23.820 --> 03:58:25.500]   And it just sucks because I know,
[03:58:25.500 --> 03:58:28.740]   and I try really hard on my channel to always separate
[03:58:28.740 --> 03:58:30.740]   and celebrate the work being done.
[03:58:30.740 --> 03:58:31.580]   'Cause at the end of the day,
[03:58:31.580 --> 03:58:34.740]   there's someone that's just going home to their family,
[03:58:34.740 --> 03:58:36.340]   clocking in hours, working really hard
[03:58:36.340 --> 03:58:40.180]   on pushing their program and doing engineering work.
[03:58:40.180 --> 03:58:43.300]   And we don't get to choose where we're born
[03:58:43.300 --> 03:58:45.140]   and what we're born into.
[03:58:45.140 --> 03:58:49.180]   So I really like to avoid the political aspects of things
[03:58:49.180 --> 03:58:52.220]   and the geopolitical aspects and just appreciate the science
[03:58:52.220 --> 03:58:53.500]   and the science we're seeing.
[03:58:53.500 --> 03:58:57.300]   And the progress that China's doing in the last 10 years
[03:58:57.300 --> 03:59:00.780]   is very akin to the early space flight programs.
[03:59:00.780 --> 03:59:03.780]   And with the runway of just keep on going,
[03:59:03.780 --> 03:59:06.140]   I see no reason for them to be slowing down.
[03:59:06.140 --> 03:59:07.980]   So it's definitely something to watch
[03:59:07.980 --> 03:59:09.820]   and be interested in.
[03:59:09.820 --> 03:59:10.780]   And who knows?
[03:59:10.780 --> 03:59:13.580]   I mean, there really genuinely might be a race
[03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:14.420]   to the moon again,
[03:59:14.420 --> 03:59:16.940]   and there really genuinely might be a race to Mars.
[03:59:18.900 --> 03:59:20.780]   - Part of me is excited about that
[03:59:20.780 --> 03:59:23.300]   'cause a race is pretty cool.
[03:59:23.300 --> 03:59:28.900]   But hopefully it's friendly competition
[03:59:28.900 --> 03:59:30.420]   and some collaboration.
[03:59:30.420 --> 03:59:34.460]   It is true that maybe I'm being a bit cynical,
[03:59:34.460 --> 03:59:37.260]   but nations sometimes,
[03:59:37.260 --> 03:59:39.260]   governments and leaders of those governments
[03:59:39.260 --> 03:59:40.860]   sometimes ruin things.
[03:59:40.860 --> 03:59:42.340]   Like you don't often have,
[03:59:42.340 --> 03:59:44.620]   statistically speaking,
[03:59:44.620 --> 03:59:46.900]   it's harder to have a leader of a nation
[03:59:46.900 --> 03:59:51.900]   that looks beyond the particular political bickering
[03:59:51.900 --> 03:59:53.260]   of that nation.
[03:59:53.260 --> 03:59:54.980]   And you have like a JFK type character
[03:59:54.980 --> 03:59:56.740]   that really steps up and inspires.
[03:59:56.740 --> 03:59:58.420]   I think statistically speaking,
[03:59:58.420 --> 04:00:00.140]   it's better to have somebody like Elon,
[04:00:00.140 --> 04:00:01.380]   who's a leader of a company,
[04:00:01.380 --> 04:00:04.460]   a commercial effort that is able to look beyond
[04:00:04.460 --> 04:00:05.900]   the borders of nations.
[04:00:05.900 --> 04:00:10.020]   And certainly inspiring educators like yourself
[04:00:10.020 --> 04:00:14.300]   to look beyond the borders of those nations
[04:00:14.300 --> 04:00:16.460]   and the geopolitical conflicts and so on
[04:00:16.460 --> 04:00:19.820]   to inspire people.
[04:00:19.820 --> 04:00:22.180]   I think that's just made so much easier.
[04:00:22.180 --> 04:00:24.640]   Like you can have more reach.
[04:00:24.640 --> 04:00:29.300]   Tim Dodd can have more reach than NASA, right?
[04:00:29.300 --> 04:00:31.900]   Like in terms of inspiring the world.
[04:00:31.900 --> 04:00:33.100]   And that's fascinating.
[04:00:33.100 --> 04:00:35.740]   Like that gives power to the individuals
[04:00:35.740 --> 04:00:40.740]   that see past the silly short-term geopolitical conflicts.
[04:00:40.740 --> 04:00:42.740]   That's the hope at least.
[04:00:44.740 --> 04:00:48.740]   - Do you worry that there might be a war in space?
[04:00:48.740 --> 04:00:49.780]   - Yeah.
[04:00:49.780 --> 04:00:50.940]   - Let's look out into the future.
[04:00:50.940 --> 04:00:53.740]   So forget, so the interesting thing
[04:00:53.740 --> 04:00:54.860]   about these rockets, right?
[04:00:54.860 --> 04:00:59.480]   Let's not forget rockets do what rockets do.
[04:00:59.480 --> 04:01:03.440]   That they can carry payloads that can be weapons.
[04:01:03.440 --> 04:01:07.880]   Do you worry about this?
[04:01:07.880 --> 04:01:11.700]   - I worry most about space wars
[04:01:11.700 --> 04:01:14.100]   as leading to the Kessler syndrome
[04:01:14.100 --> 04:01:17.660]   of having a cascading effect of like a spacecraft
[04:01:17.660 --> 04:01:20.060]   blowing up and then affecting another spacecraft
[04:01:20.060 --> 04:01:20.900]   and that blows up.
[04:01:20.900 --> 04:01:22.460]   And then all of a sudden you're trapped
[04:01:22.460 --> 04:01:26.500]   and have this debris cloud that we can't go into space
[04:01:26.500 --> 04:01:27.340]   anymore.
[04:01:27.340 --> 04:01:28.180]   Like that's my biggest,
[04:01:28.180 --> 04:01:30.300]   'cause frankly at this point we could annihilate ourselves
[04:01:30.300 --> 04:01:32.060]   with terrestrial stuff anyway.
[04:01:32.060 --> 04:01:32.900]   You know what I mean?
[04:01:32.900 --> 04:01:37.300]   We don't need space to end society as we know it.
[04:01:37.300 --> 04:01:39.020]   You know what I mean?
[04:01:39.020 --> 04:01:42.340]   But we could really,
[04:01:42.340 --> 04:01:44.460]   and the good thing is I think everyone,
[04:01:44.460 --> 04:01:46.820]   well mostly everyone seems to understand this
[04:01:46.820 --> 04:01:47.660]   for the most part,
[04:01:47.660 --> 04:01:50.700]   that like we really can't be risking
[04:01:50.700 --> 04:01:53.280]   blowing up stuff in space in low Earth orbit
[04:01:53.280 --> 04:01:55.380]   because it could easily,
[04:01:55.380 --> 04:01:57.420]   like we could strain ourselves from space assets
[04:01:57.420 --> 04:01:58.540]   for 50 years.
[04:01:58.540 --> 04:02:00.780]   - Oh, can you elaborate on this?
[04:02:00.780 --> 04:02:03.020]   So like what is the danger of the debris there
[04:02:03.020 --> 04:02:06.620]   that could jeopardize the space?
[04:02:06.620 --> 04:02:07.980]   - So for instance,
[04:02:07.980 --> 04:02:09.340]   and it was only a couple years ago,
[04:02:09.340 --> 04:02:12.980]   Russia did an anti-satellite test on an orbital.
[04:02:12.980 --> 04:02:14.940]   We've done this too,
[04:02:14.940 --> 04:02:15.820]   the US has done this.
[04:02:15.820 --> 04:02:17.580]   I'm not pinning it on them,
[04:02:17.580 --> 04:02:19.460]   but we kind of know nowadays
[04:02:19.460 --> 04:02:22.660]   like don't do anti-satellite tests on orbital things
[04:02:22.660 --> 04:02:24.540]   because those things stay in orbit.
[04:02:24.540 --> 04:02:26.420]   You know, when you blow something up in space,
[04:02:26.420 --> 04:02:27.760]   it's not like,
[04:02:27.760 --> 04:02:30.500]   you know people think in space like,
[04:02:30.500 --> 04:02:31.700]   oh you throw something,
[04:02:31.700 --> 04:02:34.060]   it's just gonna keep going forever and ever and ever.
[04:02:34.060 --> 04:02:37.020]   I mean that's in the sense that it's not going to be
[04:02:37.020 --> 04:02:39.820]   slowed down due to air resistance.
[04:02:39.820 --> 04:02:41.540]   It's going to continue to do that,
[04:02:41.540 --> 04:02:42.980]   but it's staying in orbit around the Earth.
[04:02:42.980 --> 04:02:45.900]   Like you just slightly change the orbit of it around Earth
[04:02:45.900 --> 04:02:48.700]   when you throw a ball or something, you know.
[04:02:48.700 --> 04:02:53.100]   So the scary thing is when you blow up a satellite,
[04:02:53.100 --> 04:02:55.420]   all those pieces of that satellite are now
[04:02:55.420 --> 04:03:00.940]   millions of bullets in a halo around the Earth,
[04:03:00.940 --> 04:03:02.860]   in a very specific halo, you know.
[04:03:02.860 --> 04:03:06.860]   So some things get blown up faster, you know,
[04:03:06.860 --> 04:03:08.180]   according to its orbit, faster,
[04:03:08.180 --> 04:03:10.220]   so they'll go a little bit higher elliptically.
[04:03:10.220 --> 04:03:12.340]   Some things will get slowed down in that explosion
[04:03:12.340 --> 04:03:13.460]   and actually reenter.
[04:03:13.460 --> 04:03:14.820]   Some things will go sideways
[04:03:14.820 --> 04:03:16.420]   and change its inclination of that orbit.
[04:03:16.420 --> 04:03:17.980]   So you have this debris field,
[04:03:17.980 --> 04:03:21.780]   but it more or less becomes a band of like,
[04:03:21.780 --> 04:03:24.020]   no no, you know like a big scary,
[04:03:24.020 --> 04:03:28.940]   sharp scary bullets that can destroy another spacecraft.
[04:03:28.940 --> 04:03:30.620]   And so then all of a sudden, especially now Starlink,
[04:03:30.620 --> 04:03:32.300]   you know we're talking about thousands and thousands
[04:03:32.300 --> 04:03:34.540]   and thousands of satellites in space.
[04:03:34.540 --> 04:03:36.580]   If all of a sudden one, you know,
[04:03:36.580 --> 04:03:39.220]   a couple of them crash and you know, blow up
[04:03:39.220 --> 04:03:40.380]   and all of a sudden you have all the shrapnel
[04:03:40.380 --> 04:03:42.580]   going everywhere and then that hits another satellite,
[04:03:42.580 --> 04:03:43.420]   that creates shrapnel.
[04:03:43.420 --> 04:03:47.020]   You can literally blanket our entire low Earth orbit
[04:03:47.020 --> 04:03:50.660]   in 17,500 mile an hour bullets.
[04:03:50.660 --> 04:03:56.100]   You know, we're talking, the kinetic energy in this
[04:03:56.100 --> 04:03:57.300]   is so hard for people to fathom
[04:03:57.300 --> 04:03:59.460]   'cause that's over 10 times faster
[04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:01.140]   than most like rifle bullets.
[04:04:01.140 --> 04:04:04.620]   And even like a big 50 cal is not gonna be,
[04:04:04.620 --> 04:04:07.820]   you know, we're still talking about about 10%.
[04:04:07.820 --> 04:04:10.140]   That, so when you think about the kinetic energy,
[04:04:10.140 --> 04:04:10.980]   it's insane.
[04:04:10.980 --> 04:04:15.620]   So a fleck of paint can go through panes of glass
[04:04:15.620 --> 04:04:17.060]   at that velocity.
[04:04:17.060 --> 04:04:19.580]   You know, a little piece of metal can puncture,
[04:04:19.580 --> 04:04:21.940]   you know, blow straight through.
[04:04:21.940 --> 04:04:26.580]   - So like, so our actions that seem small,
[04:04:26.580 --> 04:04:28.980]   so small scale military actions
[04:04:32.100 --> 04:04:34.380]   can have dire detrimental effects
[04:04:34.380 --> 04:04:37.300]   to the whole space program, like global space program.
[04:04:37.300 --> 04:04:40.180]   - Oh yeah, it can affect everything and everyone.
[04:04:40.180 --> 04:04:42.920]   - Including the, like including satellites.
[04:04:42.920 --> 04:04:44.620]   - Oh yeah, especially satellites.
[04:04:44.620 --> 04:04:47.660]   Like that's, well I mean, the good and the bad thing is,
[04:04:47.660 --> 04:04:50.260]   the good thing is a lot of satellites don't operate
[04:04:50.260 --> 04:04:51.280]   in low Earth orbit.
[04:04:51.280 --> 04:04:53.840]   Like a lot of the ones that we use day to day,
[04:04:53.840 --> 04:04:56.620]   a lot of them are in medium Earth orbit,
[04:04:56.620 --> 04:04:59.420]   like their GPS or their geostationary,
[04:04:59.420 --> 04:05:01.500]   which are way, way, way out there.
[04:05:01.500 --> 04:05:05.500]   And because of that, they won't really ever deorbit,
[04:05:05.500 --> 04:05:08.020]   like it'll take, you know, millennia to deorbit
[04:05:08.020 --> 04:05:10.220]   because, you know, just because something's in space
[04:05:10.220 --> 04:05:11.380]   doesn't mean it's there forever,
[04:05:11.380 --> 04:05:13.100]   especially like in low Earth orbit.
[04:05:13.100 --> 04:05:14.740]   The atmosphere doesn't just suddenly stop.
[04:05:14.740 --> 04:05:17.260]   It's not like you hit the Kármán line 100 kilometers
[04:05:17.260 --> 04:05:18.600]   and all of a sudden there's zero atmosphere.
[04:05:18.600 --> 04:05:20.300]   The atmosphere just slowly tapers, you know.
[04:05:20.300 --> 04:05:22.380]   You can experience that yourself as you climb a mountain,
[04:05:22.380 --> 04:05:24.660]   you slowly realize there's less and less air,
[04:05:24.660 --> 04:05:26.100]   you just keep going.
[04:05:26.100 --> 04:05:29.580]   And just because you're in space 200, 300 kilometers up,
[04:05:29.580 --> 04:05:31.700]   there's still trace molecules, you know.
[04:05:31.700 --> 04:05:34.020]   There's the occasional oxygen molecule,
[04:05:34.020 --> 04:05:35.900]   there's the occasional nitrogen molecule.
[04:05:35.900 --> 04:05:37.300]   And so that is actually drag.
[04:05:37.300 --> 04:05:39.840]   So a spacecraft in low Earth orbit,
[04:05:39.840 --> 04:05:40.820]   depending on its altitude,
[04:05:40.820 --> 04:05:45.060]   will take anywhere from five years to five months
[04:05:45.060 --> 04:05:47.340]   to deorbit, you know, or two months or one month.
[04:05:47.340 --> 04:05:49.900]   Like depending on its orbit or its altitude,
[04:05:49.900 --> 04:05:51.500]   we'll have some parasitic drag still
[04:05:51.500 --> 04:05:54.060]   and slowly throughout time slow down,
[04:05:54.060 --> 04:05:57.080]   which lowers its orbit, which drags it down more,
[04:05:57.080 --> 04:05:58.660]   lowers its orbit, and et cetera, et cetera,
[04:05:58.660 --> 04:06:00.220]   until it reenters.
[04:06:00.220 --> 04:06:04.580]   So if we end up with some kind of catastrophic event
[04:06:04.580 --> 04:06:07.900]   where the entire low Earth orbit has been inundated
[04:06:07.900 --> 04:06:11.740]   and blown up, it'll take months for the first band
[04:06:11.740 --> 04:06:14.700]   to clear up, it'll take years for something like beyond.
[04:06:14.700 --> 04:06:15.540]   There's charts, you know,
[04:06:15.540 --> 04:06:17.700]   people have all this stuff available.
[04:06:17.700 --> 04:06:18.540]   You shouldn't look at that stuff.
[04:06:18.540 --> 04:06:20.660]   - This is terrifying, by the way.
[04:06:20.660 --> 04:06:22.500]   This is really--
[04:06:22.500 --> 04:06:25.380]   - But again, the caveat is for the most part,
[04:06:25.380 --> 04:06:28.660]   the low Earth orbit stuff would clear up within years.
[04:06:28.660 --> 04:06:30.460]   So we could get back to doing some more with it.
[04:06:30.460 --> 04:06:33.220]   Like Starlink stuff would probably be able to be re,
[04:06:33.220 --> 04:06:35.020]   and you know, we could kind of redo it
[04:06:35.020 --> 04:06:37.180]   and build up from the ground up again.
[04:06:37.180 --> 04:06:38.580]   GPS wouldn't be wiped out,
[04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:40.220]   and our geostationary satellites wouldn't be wiped out.
[04:06:40.220 --> 04:06:42.580]   But the scary thing is we wouldn't be able to relaunch
[04:06:42.580 --> 04:06:45.060]   and replace new things because we're stuck.
[04:06:45.060 --> 04:06:47.780]   We're not gonna fly through that debris field, you know?
[04:06:47.780 --> 04:06:52.680]   - And we avoid that by avoiding military actions in space.
[04:06:52.680 --> 04:06:57.000]   - And these days, like there's more and more requirements
[04:06:57.000 --> 04:06:59.280]   and legislation, and especially trying
[04:06:59.280 --> 04:07:00.500]   to get international collaboration
[04:07:00.500 --> 04:07:03.020]   on having end of life plans for satellites.
[04:07:03.020 --> 04:07:05.580]   So that satellites, especially those in low Earth orbit,
[04:07:05.580 --> 04:07:07.400]   have like drag devices to increase.
[04:07:07.400 --> 04:07:08.940]   Then once they're done, they literally pull like,
[04:07:08.940 --> 04:07:12.340]   even just a ribbon, like a silly little like, you know,
[04:07:12.340 --> 04:07:15.460]   40 foot long ribbon will sit there and it'll slowly,
[04:07:15.460 --> 04:07:18.360]   or it can speed up its reentry process
[04:07:18.360 --> 04:07:20.520]   by months or years or whatever.
[04:07:20.520 --> 04:07:22.340]   So we're starting to see that this is now
[04:07:22.340 --> 04:07:24.580]   an importance, there's a really cool company
[04:07:24.580 --> 04:07:26.960]   called Stoke Aerospace out in Washington
[04:07:26.960 --> 04:07:29.420]   is one of these launch providers that's really looking
[04:07:29.420 --> 04:07:31.100]   not into just trying to be the next, you know,
[04:07:31.100 --> 04:07:32.700]   SpaceX launch company.
[04:07:32.700 --> 04:07:34.860]   They're really seeing satellite,
[04:07:34.860 --> 04:07:37.140]   bringing stuff down from space,
[04:07:37.140 --> 04:07:39.180]   is actually being, especially right now,
[04:07:39.180 --> 04:07:41.740]   we have all of these hundreds and thousands
[04:07:41.740 --> 04:07:43.520]   of satellites being launched every year.
[04:07:43.520 --> 04:07:45.180]   Someone at some point is probably gonna have
[04:07:45.180 --> 04:07:46.100]   to do some cleanup.
[04:07:46.100 --> 04:07:48.580]   And so they're looking at being one
[04:07:48.580 --> 04:07:50.100]   of those companies to do that.
[04:07:50.100 --> 04:07:52.580]   - Well, what do you think about Starlink
[04:07:52.580 --> 04:07:56.620]   and the efforts of Starlink to put a very large number
[04:07:56.620 --> 04:08:01.620]   of satellites out there and provide internet access
[04:08:01.620 --> 04:08:05.380]   to Earth? - Anyone.
[04:08:05.380 --> 04:08:06.300]   - To anyone.
[04:08:06.300 --> 04:08:09.620]   - Generally, I think Starlink is phenomenal.
[04:08:09.620 --> 04:08:11.860]   And I would be saying this if it was any company,
[04:08:11.860 --> 04:08:13.260]   I wanna make that clear that people think
[04:08:13.260 --> 04:08:15.380]   I'm just some, you know, SpaceX fanboy or something
[04:08:15.380 --> 04:08:16.700]   and anything they do is perfect.
[04:08:16.700 --> 04:08:19.540]   - I think as your fan, I could say you're basically
[04:08:19.540 --> 04:08:23.420]   a fanboy or just a fan of everybody
[04:08:23.420 --> 04:08:24.940]   that's doing space stuff.
[04:08:24.940 --> 04:08:26.620]   And I don't, like, there's no,
[04:08:26.620 --> 04:08:27.900]   even in this whole conversation,
[04:08:27.900 --> 04:08:29.700]   there's no way we cover like 10%
[04:08:29.700 --> 04:08:30.980]   of what I wanted to talk to you about,
[04:08:30.980 --> 04:08:32.220]   so we're jumping around.
[04:08:32.220 --> 04:08:33.820]   I mean, there's, we could talk probably
[04:08:33.820 --> 04:08:36.300]   for an hour about Artemis.
[04:08:36.300 --> 04:08:40.300]   We could talk about anything with ULA,
[04:08:40.300 --> 04:08:43.420]   obviously all the other commercial efforts.
[04:08:43.420 --> 04:08:44.980]   We could talk about the NASA efforts,
[04:08:44.980 --> 04:08:48.260]   the, you know, the, I mean, and Saturn 5.
[04:08:48.260 --> 04:08:50.260]   Like, are we gonna really go with this conversation?
[04:08:50.260 --> 04:08:51.500]   I'm talking about Saturn 5.
[04:08:51.500 --> 04:08:53.060]   And we might, okay?
[04:08:53.060 --> 04:08:55.860]   So like, anyway, if you're a fan of everything,
[04:08:55.860 --> 04:08:59.620]   Starlink is in general exciting to you.
[04:08:59.620 --> 04:09:01.700]   - And not for the space assets,
[04:09:01.700 --> 04:09:03.060]   but just the potential for humanity.
[04:09:03.060 --> 04:09:05.900]   Like, I really think even as a consumer
[04:09:05.900 --> 04:09:07.860]   of the internet personally,
[04:09:07.860 --> 04:09:09.580]   our studio space down in Texas,
[04:09:09.580 --> 04:09:11.780]   we're stuck with Mediacom,
[04:09:11.780 --> 04:09:15.180]   which has like the least reliable internet service, period.
[04:09:15.180 --> 04:09:16.020]   That's the only option.
[04:09:16.020 --> 04:09:18.620]   Either that or they're trying to charge me like $20,000
[04:09:18.620 --> 04:09:21.420]   to run a fiber optic cable like 1,000 meters or something.
[04:09:21.420 --> 04:09:23.340]   Like, it's insane.
[04:09:23.340 --> 04:09:24.780]   I'm not going to do that.
[04:09:24.780 --> 04:09:26.140]   I bought Starlink.
[04:09:26.140 --> 04:09:29.100]   It helps, but it's still not, you know, amazing.
[04:09:29.100 --> 04:09:30.580]   But it has, you can see where this is going
[04:09:30.580 --> 04:09:32.300]   in a year or two, three, five years.
[04:09:32.300 --> 04:09:33.900]   They're like, oh, I can totally screw
[04:09:33.900 --> 04:09:35.020]   this other internet provider.
[04:09:35.020 --> 04:09:37.820]   And this is now by far the best option.
[04:09:37.820 --> 04:09:39.500]   And it's available literally anywhere.
[04:09:39.500 --> 04:09:42.180]   You don't have to be limited to your internet,
[04:09:42.180 --> 04:09:43.780]   local internet service provider.
[04:09:44.660 --> 04:09:46.380]   And on the global scale, of course,
[04:09:46.380 --> 04:09:48.780]   you have people being able to learn
[04:09:48.780 --> 04:09:52.660]   and learn about rockets, learn about water management
[04:09:52.660 --> 04:09:57.660]   and architecture and city planning and fitness and health.
[04:09:57.660 --> 04:09:59.380]   All of the modern conveniences
[04:09:59.380 --> 04:10:00.720]   that we Google every single day,
[04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:03.460]   there's people that don't have access to that right now.
[04:10:03.460 --> 04:10:06.300]   You know, I'm a self-taught rocket nerd.
[04:10:06.300 --> 04:10:08.660]   I would not be who I am if it wasn't for the internet
[04:10:08.660 --> 04:10:11.260]   in the last seven years, you know, six, seven years.
[04:10:11.260 --> 04:10:14.060]   - So unlocking the intellectual potential
[04:10:14.060 --> 04:10:16.300]   of places like Africa, of rural areas
[04:10:16.300 --> 04:10:18.400]   that don't currently have internet access.
[04:10:18.400 --> 04:10:22.620]   - That's a genuine, that's a huge thing.
[04:10:22.620 --> 04:10:25.060]   That's like humanitarian 101
[04:10:25.060 --> 04:10:27.220]   is give people access to information.
[04:10:27.220 --> 04:10:31.100]   And like, you know, I think we have this potential
[04:10:31.100 --> 04:10:33.300]   to try to step in and fix other people's problems.
[04:10:33.300 --> 04:10:35.140]   But the reality is like people are smart.
[04:10:35.140 --> 04:10:37.340]   No matter where you are, you give them the resources
[04:10:37.340 --> 04:10:39.180]   to learn, they're gonna solve problems.
[04:10:39.180 --> 04:10:40.580]   They're gonna problem solve, they're gonna engineer,
[04:10:40.580 --> 04:10:43.140]   they're going to, but if you don't give them access
[04:10:43.140 --> 04:10:44.740]   to that information, they're gonna be stuck
[04:10:44.740 --> 04:10:46.780]   in their cycles, you know?
[04:10:46.780 --> 04:10:50.780]   And so I think the potential for Starlink is incredible.
[04:10:50.780 --> 04:10:52.220]   I think it's already impactful.
[04:10:52.220 --> 04:10:55.660]   It's already affecting people in, you know,
[04:10:55.660 --> 04:10:57.780]   in rural and indigenous areas,
[04:10:57.780 --> 04:11:00.700]   and it's already affecting businesses and all that stuff.
[04:11:00.700 --> 04:11:02.060]   I think it's great.
[04:11:02.060 --> 04:11:06.140]   I think it is, you know, there's some downsides
[04:11:06.140 --> 04:11:08.980]   with astronomy, with ground-based astronomy
[04:11:08.980 --> 04:11:13.060]   that it can hinder observations from the ground.
[04:11:13.060 --> 04:11:14.900]   There's already a lot of communications
[04:11:14.900 --> 04:11:18.780]   between SpaceX and astronomical societies
[04:11:18.780 --> 04:11:21.260]   and things like that, because it is a real concern.
[04:11:21.260 --> 04:11:25.220]   You know, it can ruin observations, it can ruin data.
[04:11:25.220 --> 04:11:26.580]   But like one of the big ones, for instance,
[04:11:26.580 --> 04:11:29.220]   recently I think a new thing they're going to be working
[04:11:29.220 --> 04:11:32.540]   into is that currently, if a Starlink is flying
[04:11:32.540 --> 04:11:37.540]   over a ground-based asset, a lot of ground telescopes
[04:11:37.540 --> 04:11:40.300]   actually have a laser that goes up
[04:11:40.300 --> 04:11:42.220]   and it measures the atmospheric distortion.
[04:11:42.220 --> 04:11:43.700]   And the telescopes literally sit there
[04:11:43.700 --> 04:11:48.340]   and like by the millisecond fixes, like changes the focus
[04:11:48.340 --> 04:11:51.580]   and fixes those atmospheric distortions.
[04:11:51.580 --> 04:11:54.620]   And that laser can interfere with satellites.
[04:11:54.620 --> 04:11:57.740]   So previously, I'm pretty sure that SpaceX actually had
[04:11:57.740 --> 04:12:00.420]   to, you know, request that as they're flying
[04:12:00.420 --> 04:12:02.460]   over these satellites, or these telescopes,
[04:12:02.460 --> 04:12:04.260]   they turn off the laser.
[04:12:04.260 --> 04:12:08.540]   And when you have tens of thousands of these things flying,
[04:12:08.540 --> 04:12:11.300]   you're going to be turning off the laser more than it's on,
[04:12:11.300 --> 04:12:14.100]   you know, and just being this insanely inconvenient thing.
[04:12:14.100 --> 04:12:16.580]   'Cause you're going to have these junctions happen often.
[04:12:16.580 --> 04:12:18.380]   And I think one of the things that SpaceX is like,
[04:12:18.380 --> 04:12:20.220]   "Okay, no, no, no, you guys keep the laser on,
[04:12:20.220 --> 04:12:21.700]   we'll deal with your laser."
[04:12:21.700 --> 04:12:24.500]   Good, good step, you know, things like that,
[04:12:24.500 --> 04:12:27.600]   mitigating the brightness of them so they're not visible
[04:12:27.600 --> 04:12:29.340]   under most conditions, of course,
[04:12:29.340 --> 04:12:32.780]   like they're still always going to be visible in some.
[04:12:32.780 --> 04:12:34.940]   But then ultimately for me, it's like this,
[04:12:34.940 --> 04:12:37.420]   you have this weird, like almost like a puberty
[04:12:37.420 --> 04:12:40.860]   of spaceflight and astronomy,
[04:12:40.860 --> 04:12:43.420]   where currently it's not cheap enough to really do a ton
[04:12:43.420 --> 04:12:46.620]   of incredible science or space-based telescopes.
[04:12:46.620 --> 04:12:48.700]   You know, we have Webb, we have Hubble,
[04:12:48.700 --> 04:12:51.860]   we have, you know, all these other, you know,
[04:12:51.860 --> 04:12:55.940]   awesome space-based telescopes, Chandra, you know,
[04:12:55.940 --> 04:12:57.020]   et cetera, et cetera, whatever.
[04:12:57.020 --> 04:13:02.020]   And you, but it's still so expensive to launch them,
[04:13:02.020 --> 04:13:04.660]   that we're still so reliant on our ground telescopes.
[04:13:04.660 --> 04:13:07.580]   But in the future, you can see a world where,
[04:13:07.580 --> 04:13:09.540]   "Oh, this is so cheap, we'll just launch,
[04:13:09.540 --> 04:13:12.820]   like we can launch 50 James Webb space telescope-sized
[04:13:12.820 --> 04:13:15.060]   telescopes this year for half the price
[04:13:15.060 --> 04:13:17.980]   of doing it on Earth," you know, and get way better data.
[04:13:17.980 --> 04:13:20.080]   So in the future, I think in 20, 30 years,
[04:13:20.080 --> 04:13:20.920]   we'll look at it and be like,
[04:13:20.920 --> 04:13:22.200]   "Oh man, that was an awkward time,
[04:13:22.200 --> 04:13:26.140]   where space assets were interfering with astronomy."
[04:13:26.140 --> 04:13:27.260]   But I think in the future, it's like,
[04:13:27.260 --> 04:13:29.060]   "Can you imagine doing space, you know,
[04:13:29.060 --> 04:13:31.340]   astronomy from the ground?
[04:13:31.340 --> 04:13:32.180]   That's insane, you know?"
[04:13:32.180 --> 04:13:33.980]   - There could be complexities to just having
[04:13:33.980 --> 04:13:36.020]   that many, just another topic.
[04:13:36.020 --> 04:13:39.580]   So a complexity is associated with having so many satellites,
[04:13:39.580 --> 04:13:43.740]   especially with competing companies and competing nations.
[04:13:43.740 --> 04:13:46.020]   Do you see that as an issue, having tens of thousands,
[04:13:46.020 --> 04:13:47.820]   hundreds of thousands of satellites?
[04:13:47.820 --> 04:13:48.660]   - Yeah.
[04:13:48.660 --> 04:13:51.180]   - It becomes a very interesting robotics
[04:13:51.180 --> 04:13:52.720]   collision avoidance problem.
[04:13:52.720 --> 04:13:55.220]   - The one thing to keep in mind is perspective.
[04:13:55.220 --> 04:13:57.380]   Like I know 10,000 satellites and 20,000
[04:13:57.380 --> 04:13:59.940]   and 100,000 satellites sounds insane,
[04:13:59.940 --> 04:14:01.860]   and it sounds really scary.
[04:14:01.860 --> 04:14:04.100]   But I mean, just even look at how many planes
[04:14:04.100 --> 04:14:05.780]   are in the air at any given time.
[04:14:05.780 --> 04:14:08.660]   And the planes are bigger, they're flying slower,
[04:14:08.660 --> 04:14:10.620]   which actually means there's a greater chance of collision.
[04:14:10.620 --> 04:14:14.100]   If you think about, you know, two objects occupying space,
[04:14:14.100 --> 04:14:15.420]   if they're, one's moving really fast,
[04:14:15.420 --> 04:14:16.900]   like imagine trying to, you know,
[04:14:16.900 --> 04:14:19.420]   throw two basketballs at each other, relatively easy.
[04:14:19.420 --> 04:14:21.500]   Now try shooting two bullets at each other
[04:14:21.500 --> 04:14:24.140]   and having like, you know, at 90 degrees from each other.
[04:14:24.140 --> 04:14:25.380]   You have to have your timing down,
[04:14:25.380 --> 04:14:28.120]   like really perfect to do that.
[04:14:28.120 --> 04:14:29.660]   Now take that times 10, you know,
[04:14:29.660 --> 04:14:33.140]   and these objects are taking up physical space
[04:14:33.140 --> 04:14:34.340]   very small amount of time.
[04:14:34.340 --> 04:14:35.240]   They're relatively small,
[04:14:35.240 --> 04:14:36.820]   like most satellites are not very big,
[04:14:36.820 --> 04:14:40.160]   and they have limitless altitudes to deal with.
[04:14:40.160 --> 04:14:43.060]   So even though you can have what look like convergences,
[04:14:43.060 --> 04:14:45.100]   you know, they can be 10, 20, 50,
[04:14:45.100 --> 04:14:46.700]   100 kilometers difference often.
[04:14:46.700 --> 04:14:48.740]   And you know, they're dealing with this,
[04:14:48.740 --> 04:14:51.720]   like all the all space assets know,
[04:14:51.720 --> 04:14:54.220]   hey, I'm at this orbital plane and this blah, blah, blah,
[04:14:54.220 --> 04:14:56.380]   and they know their altitudes and know their safe distances
[04:14:56.380 --> 04:14:58.260]   and have these margins built in.
[04:14:58.260 --> 04:14:59.100]   And it's space.
[04:14:59.100 --> 04:15:01.860]   So there's like an insane amount of room, you know.
[04:15:01.860 --> 04:15:03.420]   So there's-- - There's a lot of margin.
[04:15:03.420 --> 04:15:04.880]   - There's a lot of margin,
[04:15:04.880 --> 04:15:07.660]   but of course you can't excuse that all the way.
[04:15:07.660 --> 04:15:09.700]   Like you have to still have plans
[04:15:09.700 --> 04:15:12.700]   and be considering that and considering collisions
[04:15:12.700 --> 04:15:14.680]   and considering all of the above.
[04:15:14.680 --> 04:15:19.620]   - When do you think the first human being
[04:15:19.620 --> 04:15:21.060]   will step foot on Mars?
[04:15:21.060 --> 04:15:25.940]   I, you don't like timelines, but is this something,
[04:15:25.940 --> 04:15:30.620]   and you're very much focused on kind of the short term
[04:15:30.620 --> 04:15:33.460]   of incredible progress that's happening,
[04:15:33.460 --> 04:15:34.900]   and that makes total sense.
[04:15:34.900 --> 04:15:39.140]   But there is the Mars plan that was at the origin
[04:15:39.140 --> 04:15:41.180]   of the commercial spaceflight efforts.
[04:15:41.180 --> 04:15:44.740]   Do you still see and dream about that day?
[04:15:44.740 --> 04:15:47.980]   - Let me be clear that I don't wanna go to Mars.
[04:15:47.980 --> 04:15:52.860]   But I do think if you're making me guess a timeline
[04:15:52.860 --> 04:15:55.500]   for when humans will walk on Mars,
[04:15:55.500 --> 04:15:57.620]   I, even a year ago, I still would have said
[04:15:57.620 --> 04:16:01.700]   by the end of 2020, like the 2020s decade, you know.
[04:16:01.700 --> 04:16:05.140]   So by December 31st, 2029,
[04:16:05.140 --> 04:16:06.420]   I thought humans would have walked on Mars.
[04:16:06.420 --> 04:16:10.900]   I'm starting to think that's still too optimistic,
[04:16:10.900 --> 04:16:13.780]   but I do, I definitely think by 2040.
[04:16:13.780 --> 04:16:15.540]   Like I for sure think that,
[04:16:15.540 --> 04:16:19.820]   and I really think it's just hard to predict that curve,
[04:16:19.820 --> 04:16:21.700]   you know, that project out that curve.
[04:16:21.700 --> 04:16:23.460]   We're gonna go from feeling like it's impossible
[04:16:23.460 --> 04:16:24.820]   to like it's feeling like it's inevitable.
[04:16:24.820 --> 04:16:25.860]   - You know, it could be another,
[04:16:25.860 --> 04:16:28.260]   by the end of this decade, JFK type moment,
[04:16:28.260 --> 04:16:31.220]   especially if China steps up with the space race.
[04:16:31.220 --> 04:16:33.660]   It could be like, all right,
[04:16:33.660 --> 04:16:37.820]   NASA kinda says, all right, this Elon fella,
[04:16:37.820 --> 04:16:40.460]   like really make this a gigantic effort.
[04:16:40.460 --> 04:16:42.540]   - Well, and if Starship works out as planned,
[04:16:42.540 --> 04:16:45.700]   and as NASA has invested in human landing systems,
[04:16:45.700 --> 04:16:48.060]   they're relying on SpaceX to land on the moon.
[04:16:48.060 --> 04:16:51.180]   SpaceX can land on the moon, they can land on Mars.
[04:16:51.180 --> 04:16:52.900]   Now, whether or not the life support
[04:16:52.900 --> 04:16:55.940]   and the human considerations of long-term spaceflight
[04:16:55.940 --> 04:16:58.740]   missions and high radiation and blah, blah, blah, blah,
[04:16:58.740 --> 04:17:01.820]   refueling on Mars is a huge, huge, huge deal.
[04:17:01.820 --> 04:17:04.140]   They definitely could send a Starship to Mars
[04:17:04.140 --> 04:17:07.460]   and land, ideally land in one piece on Mars.
[04:17:07.460 --> 04:17:10.580]   As soon as they can land on the moon,
[04:17:10.580 --> 04:17:11.860]   they can land on Mars basically.
[04:17:11.860 --> 04:17:13.340]   I mean, those two things are very,
[04:17:13.340 --> 04:17:15.660]   in some ways Mars is almost easier.
[04:17:15.660 --> 04:17:18.500]   'Cause you can use the atmosphere to slow down.
[04:17:18.500 --> 04:17:21.420]   It actually doesn't take that much more Delta V
[04:17:21.420 --> 04:17:23.060]   to actually land on Mars than it does.
[04:17:23.060 --> 04:17:24.420]   'Cause on the moon, you don't have any,
[04:17:24.420 --> 04:17:26.460]   you have to first get out to the moon,
[04:17:26.460 --> 04:17:28.260]   then orbit the moon, you know, you have to slow down.
[04:17:28.260 --> 04:17:30.340]   Every one of those is a maneuver change.
[04:17:30.340 --> 04:17:32.140]   Then you have to lower your orbit
[04:17:32.140 --> 04:17:35.900]   until it coincides, you know, hits the moon.
[04:17:35.900 --> 04:17:38.140]   Then you have to slow down enough to not explode
[04:17:38.140 --> 04:17:39.340]   when you hit the moon.
[04:17:39.340 --> 04:17:40.460]   So there's a lot of Delta V there,
[04:17:40.460 --> 04:17:42.540]   a lot of change in velocity.
[04:17:42.540 --> 04:17:45.220]   Mars is actually, by the time we kinda crunch the numbers,
[04:17:45.220 --> 04:17:46.940]   it's relatively similar.
[04:17:46.940 --> 04:17:48.980]   It's just a lot more difficult, like timeline-wise,
[04:17:48.980 --> 04:17:50.540]   and, you know, accuracy,
[04:17:50.540 --> 04:17:52.580]   and all of these other communication, you know,
[04:17:52.580 --> 04:17:54.940]   there's a lot of other things obviously involved.
[04:17:54.940 --> 04:17:57.020]   I'm glossing over it, making it sound easy.
[04:17:57.020 --> 04:17:57.860]   It's not.
[04:17:57.860 --> 04:18:02.460]   But, you know, I think there's a real decent chance
[04:18:02.460 --> 04:18:05.260]   we could see a starship vehicle land on Mars
[04:18:05.260 --> 04:18:06.900]   uncrewed by the end of the decade, though.
[04:18:06.900 --> 04:18:08.140]   - End of the decade.
[04:18:08.140 --> 04:18:10.660]   I mean, there's also a sociological element,
[04:18:10.660 --> 04:18:13.980]   maybe a political one, where I think you're allowed
[04:18:13.980 --> 04:18:17.060]   to take more risks with Mars than you are with the moon.
[04:18:17.060 --> 04:18:21.180]   'Cause we've done the moon, 1969, it's been a while.
[04:18:21.180 --> 04:18:25.060]   So PR-wise, you have to be much safer.
[04:18:25.060 --> 04:18:27.300]   With Mars, everyone's like, it's super dangerous,
[04:18:27.300 --> 04:18:31.980]   like super, so you could take a little more risk.
[04:18:31.980 --> 04:18:32.820]   - 100%.
[04:18:32.820 --> 04:18:34.580]   - Especially with manned missions.
[04:18:34.580 --> 04:18:38.500]   But actually, just going back to the moon landing,
[04:18:38.500 --> 04:18:40.220]   Apollo 11 mission.
[04:18:40.220 --> 04:18:42.140]   We haven't talked about this, Adam.
[04:18:42.140 --> 04:18:45.580]   With the amazing engine there, but again,
[04:18:45.580 --> 04:18:47.460]   the romantic question, and you look back
[04:18:47.460 --> 04:18:52.300]   at that moon landing, one small step for man,
[04:18:52.300 --> 04:18:54.540]   one giant step for mankind.
[04:18:54.540 --> 04:18:57.860]   What do you think about that moment in human history?
[04:18:57.860 --> 04:18:59.420]   Do you go back to that often?
[04:18:59.420 --> 04:19:03.060]   Or are you focused just like with the cars on the engines?
[04:19:03.060 --> 04:19:03.900]   - No, no, no.
[04:19:03.900 --> 04:19:06.460]   I still, when I need inspiration,
[04:19:06.460 --> 04:19:09.380]   I rewatch this documentary called When We Left Earth.
[04:19:09.380 --> 04:19:11.740]   I think it was Discovery Channel did it.
[04:19:11.740 --> 04:19:13.260]   Six part episode.
[04:19:13.900 --> 04:19:16.820]   It was narrated by Gary Sinise.
[04:19:16.820 --> 04:19:20.060]   Phenomenal overview of the space race.
[04:19:20.060 --> 04:19:23.220]   And that will get my juices flowing every time.
[04:19:23.220 --> 04:19:24.060]   Every time.
[04:19:24.060 --> 04:19:25.460]   Just, it's so well done.
[04:19:25.460 --> 04:19:29.020]   And it really just summarizes that program so well.
[04:19:29.020 --> 04:19:31.300]   And when I, and beyond, it goes all the way
[04:19:31.300 --> 04:19:32.140]   to the space shuttle.
[04:19:32.140 --> 04:19:37.140]   But yeah, when I watch footage of humans walking on the moon,
[04:19:37.140 --> 04:19:41.420]   it's just, I can't believe we're dumb enough
[04:19:41.420 --> 04:19:43.380]   to do it with the technology we had
[04:19:43.380 --> 04:19:45.420]   and the risks they took to do it.
[04:19:45.420 --> 04:19:49.980]   And the insane engineering that it took to do that
[04:19:49.980 --> 04:19:53.140]   is just absolutely astonishing.
[04:19:53.140 --> 04:19:57.380]   The amount of, the sheer logistics of what it took
[04:19:57.380 --> 04:20:00.260]   to do it with the technology we had back then
[04:20:00.260 --> 04:20:04.500]   is like, how did we have so much money and effort
[04:20:04.500 --> 04:20:06.820]   and energy and time and resources,
[04:20:06.820 --> 04:20:08.500]   human resources to do this?
[04:20:08.500 --> 04:20:09.940]   It's just insane.
[04:20:09.940 --> 04:20:12.900]   - Just the weakness of the computers they had back then.
[04:20:12.900 --> 04:20:14.180]   They had to do so much.
[04:20:14.180 --> 04:20:17.260]   I mean, yeah, it's, so much with so little.
[04:20:17.260 --> 04:20:18.100]   - It's insane.
[04:20:18.100 --> 04:20:21.860]   But at the same time, I don't know if we wanna talk
[04:20:21.860 --> 04:20:23.100]   about conspiracy theories or anything,
[04:20:23.100 --> 04:20:25.900]   but it is all of, we have the proof in the pudding
[04:20:25.900 --> 04:20:30.100]   of the 400,000 people on payroll,
[04:20:30.100 --> 04:20:32.140]   all of the paperwork, all of the--
[04:20:32.140 --> 04:20:34.220]   - Oh, you mean the question, the conspiracy,
[04:20:34.220 --> 04:20:35.340]   if we land on the moon?
[04:20:35.340 --> 04:20:36.180]   - Yeah.
[04:20:36.180 --> 04:20:37.020]   - Well, I mean, I think--
[04:20:37.020 --> 04:20:38.700]   - The receipts are there, literally.
[04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:43.340]   - But it's like a lot of things like that.
[04:20:43.340 --> 04:20:46.500]   I mean, we actually generally live in a pretty cynical time
[04:20:46.500 --> 04:20:48.020]   where people distrust institutions.
[04:20:48.020 --> 04:20:50.580]   Part of the thing was the space program
[04:20:50.580 --> 04:20:53.540]   is one of the things that can help reinvigorate
[04:20:53.540 --> 04:20:55.100]   the trust in institutions.
[04:20:55.100 --> 04:20:59.180]   By institutions, even that word is a bad word now,
[04:20:59.180 --> 04:21:02.340]   but institutions means a bunch of humans get together
[04:21:02.340 --> 04:21:03.980]   and do a big thing together.
[04:21:06.100 --> 04:21:11.020]   - Yeah, but if I was conspiratorially minded,
[04:21:11.020 --> 04:21:14.700]   it's like, how the hell do humans do that?
[04:21:14.700 --> 04:21:15.740]   - Yeah.
[04:21:15.740 --> 04:21:19.020]   - So I think that's a very cynical take, unfortunately,
[04:21:19.020 --> 04:21:21.500]   but it's still an incredible one.
[04:21:21.500 --> 04:21:26.500]   And also, until you look at the receipts,
[04:21:26.500 --> 04:21:28.620]   there's a kind of a rationale
[04:21:28.620 --> 04:21:33.740]   to that kind of conspiracy theory
[04:21:33.740 --> 04:21:37.820]   because so much pressure was put on the space race,
[04:21:37.820 --> 04:21:39.980]   the PR of it, to be the winner.
[04:21:39.980 --> 04:21:43.500]   So it makes sense that you might want to try
[04:21:43.500 --> 04:21:47.620]   to take shortcuts and fake things and propaganda,
[04:21:47.620 --> 04:21:49.900]   different kinds of messaging.
[04:21:49.900 --> 04:21:51.740]   And I'm sure stuff like that was happening,
[04:21:51.740 --> 04:21:55.720]   some kind of little adjustment here and there
[04:21:55.720 --> 04:21:57.260]   to present things better and so on.
[04:21:57.260 --> 04:22:00.260]   But ultimately, the actual engineering project
[04:22:00.260 --> 04:22:02.220]   of landing on the moon,
[04:22:02.220 --> 04:22:03.820]   the fact that humans did that,
[04:22:03.820 --> 04:22:07.740]   I mean, it is sad that we didn't have better ways
[04:22:07.740 --> 04:22:08.740]   to record it.
[04:22:08.740 --> 04:22:11.420]   And as I watch SpaceX efforts and Blue Origin
[04:22:11.420 --> 04:22:15.460]   and these efforts, it's still not trivial to record
[04:22:15.460 --> 04:22:20.460]   the how just amazing, awe-inspiring space is.
[04:22:20.460 --> 04:22:24.740]   'Cause it like, you know, it's like Elon jokes about it,
[04:22:24.740 --> 04:22:26.340]   space does look fake.
[04:22:26.340 --> 04:22:27.180]   - Yeah.
[04:22:27.180 --> 04:22:29.380]   - Like, I think there is some element of it
[04:22:29.380 --> 04:22:32.460]   where you have to be there to experience it, really.
[04:22:32.460 --> 04:22:36.900]   And I don't, like, I think it's currently still
[04:22:36.900 --> 04:22:39.780]   an unsolved problem of how do you capture all of that?
[04:22:39.780 --> 04:22:42.060]   I mean, you're one of the early people
[04:22:42.060 --> 04:22:45.860]   that are part of the crew that is exploring
[04:22:45.860 --> 04:22:46.940]   that very question.
[04:22:46.940 --> 04:22:48.940]   I'm sure you won't find all the answers,
[04:22:48.940 --> 04:22:50.340]   but you'll start to say, like,
[04:22:50.340 --> 04:22:53.340]   how do we convert this into a visual format,
[04:22:53.340 --> 04:22:56.500]   into some kind of format that captures the magic of it?
[04:22:56.500 --> 04:22:57.340]   - 100%.
[04:22:57.340 --> 04:22:59.380]   And that's a perspective thing that I think about
[04:22:59.380 --> 04:23:00.500]   all the time, you know?
[04:23:00.500 --> 04:23:03.700]   And I'll do a lot of thinking about, like,
[04:23:03.700 --> 04:23:05.980]   what is the thing that's reacting to people?
[04:23:05.980 --> 04:23:06.820]   Is it the sound?
[04:23:06.820 --> 04:23:07.780]   Is it the perspective?
[04:23:07.780 --> 04:23:10.220]   Is it like seeing a little tiny human next to a landing leg
[04:23:10.220 --> 04:23:12.660]   that makes people go, oh my God, this thing is huge.
[04:23:12.660 --> 04:23:15.500]   You know, just reading, you know, and digesting that
[04:23:15.500 --> 04:23:19.500]   and trying to help to convey that as best as possible.
[04:23:19.500 --> 04:23:22.140]   Because the stuff that we are and have worked on
[04:23:22.140 --> 04:23:26.380]   is so cool, it's so exciting,
[04:23:26.380 --> 04:23:30.300]   and it's so important, and like, actually, you know,
[04:23:30.300 --> 04:23:32.360]   so much bigger than any one of us,
[04:23:32.360 --> 04:23:34.580]   physically and metaphorically.
[04:23:34.580 --> 04:23:37.700]   It's just so, it's just, I wish everyone had that experience
[04:23:37.700 --> 04:23:39.100]   and had that light bulb go off.
[04:23:39.100 --> 04:23:41.060]   - And that's the cool thing that you're, like,
[04:23:41.060 --> 04:23:44.580]   smack in the middle of solving that really difficult
[04:23:44.580 --> 04:23:48.700]   and fascinating problem of how do you capture the magic?
[04:23:48.700 --> 04:23:50.260]   How do you inspire?
[04:23:50.260 --> 04:23:52.780]   Like, that's not just an engineering problem,
[04:23:52.780 --> 04:23:55.300]   that's a communication problem, education problem.
[04:23:55.300 --> 04:23:57.660]   - I find, specifically for myself,
[04:23:57.660 --> 04:23:59.380]   that I get most excited about something
[04:23:59.380 --> 04:24:00.300]   when I learn a lot about it.
[04:24:00.300 --> 04:24:01.740]   Like, when I learn the ins and the outs,
[04:24:01.740 --> 04:24:03.460]   and I learn all the little problem solving
[04:24:03.460 --> 04:24:06.200]   and the, you know, the cool, like, oh my God,
[04:24:06.200 --> 04:24:07.700]   they had to do what to make it work?
[04:24:07.700 --> 04:24:09.540]   Wow, that's amazing.
[04:24:09.540 --> 04:24:13.140]   And that's, I try to just always go back to that root thing
[04:24:13.140 --> 04:24:15.480]   of, like, what can I teach my, like, if I'm,
[04:24:15.480 --> 04:24:18.540]   every video, I expect that I learn something making it,
[04:24:18.540 --> 04:24:19.380]   no matter what.
[04:24:19.380 --> 04:24:22.640]   Like, no matter how much I think I know about something,
[04:24:22.640 --> 04:24:24.220]   at the end of the day, if I'm not learning something,
[04:24:24.220 --> 04:24:26.100]   it's not a good video, you know?
[04:24:26.100 --> 04:24:29.740]   And I always think that people get excited when they learn,
[04:24:29.740 --> 04:24:32.500]   and when they have some questions answered for them.
[04:24:32.500 --> 04:24:36.500]   - Let me ask you a couple of quick,
[04:24:36.500 --> 04:24:38.000]   out there futuristic questions.
[04:24:38.000 --> 04:24:39.140]   I have to. - Sure.
[04:24:39.140 --> 04:24:41.340]   - I'd hate myself if I don't ask you.
[04:24:41.340 --> 04:24:43.420]   So first, let's talk about nuclear propulsion.
[04:24:43.420 --> 04:24:46.460]   So out there, interesting propulsion ideas.
[04:24:46.460 --> 04:24:48.500]   So what do you think,
[04:24:48.500 --> 04:24:52.620]   beyond the chemical engines that we talked about,
[04:24:52.620 --> 04:24:55.980]   what do you think about using nuclear fission,
[04:24:55.980 --> 04:25:00.660]   and maybe even nuclear fusion, for propulsion?
[04:25:00.660 --> 04:25:03.980]   - We already have thermal nuclear reactors.
[04:25:03.980 --> 04:25:06.540]   They're nuclear engines that have been tested
[04:25:06.540 --> 04:25:08.020]   both by the United States and Soviet Union
[04:25:08.020 --> 04:25:11.980]   that were 100% valid, like, totally ready to go,
[04:25:11.980 --> 04:25:14.740]   efficient, super awesome.
[04:25:14.740 --> 04:25:16.940]   Yes, yes, yes, hardcore yes.
[04:25:16.940 --> 04:25:21.280]   And what they're using is, yeah, basically a fusion reactor.
[04:25:21.280 --> 04:25:23.180]   You're flowing hydrogen through it,
[04:25:23.180 --> 04:25:24.140]   and heating up that hydrogen,
[04:25:24.140 --> 04:25:25.940]   taking it from liquid to gas.
[04:25:25.940 --> 04:25:30.140]   By heating it up, you're adding energy to the propellant,
[04:25:30.140 --> 04:25:31.400]   and then you're literally just using
[04:25:31.400 --> 04:25:34.140]   that now steam-hot hydrogen,
[04:25:34.140 --> 04:25:36.260]   and flowing it through a DeLaval nozzle.
[04:25:36.260 --> 04:25:38.900]   And you also have to use that energy to spin the pumps
[04:25:38.900 --> 04:25:40.440]   to still pump the thing,
[04:25:40.440 --> 04:25:42.300]   so you're still kinda using a lot of the tricks
[04:25:42.300 --> 04:25:45.060]   that you're using, but instead of a chemical reaction,
[04:25:45.060 --> 04:25:48.940]   you're literally just using nuclear fission
[04:25:48.940 --> 04:25:51.780]   to heat up propellant, and do the same thing.
[04:25:51.780 --> 04:25:52.800]   And at the end of the day, you end up with like,
[04:25:52.800 --> 04:25:54.880]   eight to 900 seconds of specific impulse,
[04:25:54.880 --> 04:25:57.660]   which is double that of chemical propulsion.
[04:25:57.660 --> 04:25:59.780]   Most of that comes just because hydrogen's so light,
[04:25:59.780 --> 04:26:02.660]   you're only emitting, you're only ejecting hydrogen
[04:26:02.660 --> 04:26:03.800]   out of the nozzle.
[04:26:03.800 --> 04:26:07.100]   So the lighter a molecule is, the faster it,
[04:26:07.100 --> 04:26:12.100]   just like if you had a golf ball versus a bowling ball,
[04:26:12.100 --> 04:26:14.760]   you can only physically throw one so fast,
[04:26:14.760 --> 04:26:15.940]   and the other one is a human
[04:26:15.940 --> 04:26:17.700]   you're not gonna do very well with.
[04:26:17.700 --> 04:26:20.280]   So you can just, you get, you have the more potential
[04:26:20.280 --> 04:26:22.380]   for a higher exit velocity.
[04:26:22.380 --> 04:26:25.220]   So nuclear thermal, amazing.
[04:26:25.220 --> 04:26:27.640]   You can just shoot these little hydrogen molecules out
[04:26:27.640 --> 04:26:30.700]   crazy fast, crazy efficiently, we already have it,
[04:26:30.700 --> 04:26:32.300]   like we can do it, yes, yes, yes.
[04:26:32.300 --> 04:26:35.160]   And actually we're already reinvesting in that again,
[04:26:35.160 --> 04:26:38.660]   as the United States is looking into basically
[04:26:38.660 --> 04:26:40.620]   ramping back up our nuclear propulsion.
[04:26:40.620 --> 04:26:42.820]   - Why haven't we done it yet?
[04:26:42.820 --> 04:26:44.620]   And what do you think the challenges are there?
[04:26:44.620 --> 04:26:46.180]   And do you think that's an obvious future?
[04:26:46.180 --> 04:26:50.080]   Like would you see in 50 years we're not using,
[04:26:50.080 --> 04:26:54.520]   like we're not, for major projects,
[04:26:54.520 --> 04:26:55.940]   like a Starship type of project,
[04:26:55.940 --> 04:26:58.100]   we're not using chemical propulsion anymore?
[04:26:58.100 --> 04:26:59.140]   - For getting off Earth,
[04:26:59.140 --> 04:27:01.380]   you'll always want to use chemical propulsion
[04:27:01.380 --> 04:27:03.380]   because the gas will come irradiated.
[04:27:03.380 --> 04:27:06.060]   Like you don't want to, and actually the thrust
[04:27:06.060 --> 04:27:08.220]   to weight ratio of these engines are relatively poor.
[04:27:08.220 --> 04:27:10.660]   They're very heavy, they have a nuclear reactor,
[04:27:10.660 --> 04:27:12.860]   like they're not, they're really,
[04:27:12.860 --> 04:27:14.220]   the reason we kind of give up on them
[04:27:14.220 --> 04:27:17.340]   is they're really most useful for like interplanetary.
[04:27:17.340 --> 04:27:18.320]   If you're trying to get a big,
[04:27:18.320 --> 04:27:21.260]   like if you're trying to send a huge payload off to Mars,
[04:27:21.260 --> 04:27:23.580]   nuclear thermal is amazing.
[04:27:23.580 --> 04:27:26.940]   It's still could be beneficial even going to the moon,
[04:27:26.940 --> 04:27:28.420]   you know, like in an Earth moon system,
[04:27:28.420 --> 04:27:31.700]   you could use nuclear thermal very effectively
[04:27:31.700 --> 04:27:33.520]   and it could be a great choice.
[04:27:33.520 --> 04:27:36.220]   But it also, that starts to get into that trade of like,
[04:27:36.220 --> 04:27:38.820]   well, we can just kind of use a little bit bigger rocket
[04:27:38.820 --> 04:27:42.860]   and fly a normal, you know, it's that whole trade thing.
[04:27:42.860 --> 04:27:46.540]   But another reason why we kind of stopped using them,
[04:27:46.540 --> 04:27:48.260]   the one that the United States developed,
[04:27:48.260 --> 04:27:50.740]   Nerva was so heavy, only a Saturn V
[04:27:50.740 --> 04:27:53.780]   could actually lift the stage of it, like the upper stage.
[04:27:53.780 --> 04:27:57.020]   So it replaced the S4B with a nuclear thermal
[04:27:57.020 --> 04:27:58.400]   with the Nerva engine.
[04:27:58.400 --> 04:28:00.860]   The Soviet Union developed one about 1/10 the size
[04:28:00.860 --> 04:28:04.740]   and thrust that was small enough to fly on a proton rocket.
[04:28:04.740 --> 04:28:07.300]   But neither of them ever flew.
[04:28:07.300 --> 04:28:09.980]   Both of them have been tested and like thumbs up,
[04:28:09.980 --> 04:28:13.100]   ready to go, which is just a huge shame to me
[04:28:13.100 --> 04:28:17.220]   'cause they could unlock a lot of interplanetary potential
[04:28:17.220 --> 04:28:19.100]   and just all around awesome.
[04:28:19.100 --> 04:28:21.820]   - Which potentially interstellar as well.
[04:28:21.820 --> 04:28:23.700]   - Not quite, I don't think nuclear thermal,
[04:28:23.700 --> 04:28:25.440]   not, we're not quite getting there,
[04:28:25.440 --> 04:28:27.660]   but then you get into like nuclear pulse drives
[04:28:27.660 --> 04:28:29.700]   and things where you're literally like
[04:28:29.700 --> 04:28:32.420]   basically ejecting a bomb out the back of your rocket
[04:28:32.420 --> 04:28:34.660]   and exploding and having like a shock absorber
[04:28:34.660 --> 04:28:37.220]   and pogo sticking your way out of the solar system.
[04:28:38.100 --> 04:28:42.020]   That's, I mean, by all physics, sure.
[04:28:42.020 --> 04:28:43.540]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[04:28:43.540 --> 04:28:45.440]   It's not breaking any laws of physics.
[04:28:45.440 --> 04:28:49.740]   But I just don't see us getting to that need anytime soon.
[04:28:49.740 --> 04:28:50.580]   I don't think we're gonna be--
[04:28:50.580 --> 04:28:51.420]   - Interstellar travel.
[04:28:51.420 --> 04:28:54.100]   - Yeah, I mean, that's, I think we're gonna want
[04:28:54.100 --> 04:28:57.300]   a better understanding of physics and physics itself.
[04:28:57.300 --> 04:29:00.980]   - Yeah, do you have a hope that maybe theoretical physics
[04:29:00.980 --> 04:29:03.700]   will open the door to some exciting propulsion systems?
[04:29:03.700 --> 04:29:05.220]   - Yeah, I do.
[04:29:05.220 --> 04:29:07.060]   I think we're still at the very infancy
[04:29:07.060 --> 04:29:09.820]   of our understanding of everything and how things work.
[04:29:09.820 --> 04:29:12.900]   And 100 years ago, it would be stupid
[04:29:12.900 --> 04:29:14.340]   to try to predict the things we know today.
[04:29:14.340 --> 04:29:17.100]   And who knows, like even, I think about things
[04:29:17.100 --> 04:29:20.100]   like James Webb looking deeper into our solar system
[04:29:20.100 --> 04:29:22.820]   than ever before and physically being able to see objects
[04:29:22.820 --> 04:29:24.140]   that we just have not even been able
[04:29:24.140 --> 04:29:25.860]   to physically see before.
[04:29:25.860 --> 04:29:29.300]   - On being able to study black holes, for example,
[04:29:29.300 --> 04:29:30.700]   better and better, the stuff that's happening
[04:29:30.700 --> 04:29:33.500]   outside of black holes, at the edges of black holes,
[04:29:33.500 --> 04:29:35.260]   how the information is stored,
[04:29:35.780 --> 04:29:40.380]   the holographic principles, just there's so much weirdness
[04:29:40.380 --> 04:29:42.180]   around black holes.
[04:29:42.180 --> 04:29:47.020]   Around where gravity starts bending light,
[04:29:47.020 --> 04:29:51.380]   it's like, all right, we'll get to look at that now
[04:29:51.380 --> 04:29:54.420]   and start to wonder like, what is going on?
[04:29:54.420 --> 04:29:59.140]   And how can we use that somehow for propulsion?
[04:29:59.140 --> 04:30:01.420]   I mean, it seems awfully crazy and futuristic
[04:30:01.420 --> 04:30:04.060]   at this moment, but I think that's because we know
[04:30:04.060 --> 04:30:09.060]   almost nothing about those kinds of objects
[04:30:09.060 --> 04:30:12.980]   where, again, where the general relativity
[04:30:12.980 --> 04:30:17.980]   and quantum mechanics start to have to be both considered
[04:30:17.980 --> 04:30:19.540]   to describe those kinds of objects.
[04:30:19.540 --> 04:30:21.860]   And as we study those objects, we might figure out
[04:30:21.860 --> 04:30:24.180]   some kind of unification thing that will allow us
[04:30:24.180 --> 04:30:29.180]   to understand maybe how to use black holes for propulsion.
[04:30:29.180 --> 04:30:33.240]   I could say a lot of crazy things,
[04:30:33.240 --> 04:30:34.780]   but basically-- - But the point is
[04:30:34.780 --> 04:30:37.500]   it'd be stupid for us to even guess about things
[04:30:37.500 --> 04:30:40.180]   we don't even know about yet, you know what I mean?
[04:30:40.180 --> 04:30:42.900]   So therefore, I'm not going to say that the best option
[04:30:42.900 --> 04:30:46.420]   for interstellar travel is nuclear drives.
[04:30:46.420 --> 04:30:49.580]   That could be someone saying in 1600,
[04:30:49.580 --> 04:30:51.620]   the only way to fly is by strapping
[04:30:51.620 --> 04:30:53.120]   a thousand birds to your head.
[04:30:53.120 --> 04:30:57.980]   - But that said, I mean, everything you're saying is right,
[04:30:57.980 --> 04:31:00.780]   but human history is such, at the beginning
[04:31:00.780 --> 04:31:03.220]   of the 20th century, physicists, Rutherford,
[04:31:03.220 --> 04:31:05.700]   everybody, there's brilliant people that said
[04:31:05.700 --> 04:31:07.900]   we've basically solved all of it.
[04:31:07.900 --> 04:31:08.860]   - Right. - If you talk
[04:31:08.860 --> 04:31:11.460]   to most physicists, I think they're going to say
[04:31:11.460 --> 04:31:15.980]   we've pretty much solved, the Standard Model
[04:31:15.980 --> 04:31:18.520]   describes physics extremely accurately.
[04:31:18.520 --> 04:31:22.380]   General relativity explains the cosmos
[04:31:22.380 --> 04:31:25.220]   as we observe them extremely accurately.
[04:31:25.220 --> 04:31:27.060]   Yeah, there's a whole dark matter, dark energy thing,
[04:31:27.060 --> 04:31:29.420]   whatever, but outside of that,
[04:31:30.260 --> 04:31:31.940]   so we basically solved,
[04:31:31.940 --> 04:31:37.620]   where are you going to find gaps in knowledge
[04:31:37.620 --> 04:31:40.380]   that are going to somehow create warp drives
[04:31:40.380 --> 04:31:42.220]   or something like that, so wormholes?
[04:31:42.220 --> 04:31:46.660]   But it seems like throughout history,
[04:31:46.660 --> 04:31:48.900]   we prove ourselves wrong time and time again.
[04:31:48.900 --> 04:31:53.580]   - Yes, and this is well outside of any of my knowledge base,
[04:31:53.580 --> 04:31:55.740]   so I want to make sure that if I say anything stupid,
[04:31:55.740 --> 04:31:59.700]   it's because I'm just a peasant here in physics land,
[04:31:59.700 --> 04:32:03.260]   but yes, we're all peasants in physics land.
[04:32:03.260 --> 04:32:06.420]   - But I really just think it's very humbling
[04:32:06.420 --> 04:32:08.380]   that we're still using chemical propulsion
[04:32:08.380 --> 04:32:11.820]   and variants of, like injecting mass to propel ourselves,
[04:32:11.820 --> 04:32:14.180]   and no matter how you get at it,
[04:32:14.180 --> 04:32:18.180]   and I think someday, I would expect that our species
[04:32:18.180 --> 04:32:20.660]   has figured out a way to get beyond that.
[04:32:20.660 --> 04:32:24.380]   - Gotta ask you another wild question.
[04:32:24.380 --> 04:32:28.500]   What do you think of Bob Lazar,
[04:32:28.500 --> 04:32:33.500]   who claimed that he worked at and saw in Area 51,
[04:32:33.500 --> 04:32:37.980]   a propulsion system fueled by, I'm quoting here,
[04:32:37.980 --> 04:32:40.900]   maybe from Wikipedia, I don't know where I got this from,
[04:32:40.900 --> 04:32:43.020]   fueled by an antimatter reactor,
[04:32:43.020 --> 04:32:45.860]   which used as fuel the chemical element
[04:32:45.860 --> 04:32:48.220]   with atomic number 115.
[04:32:48.220 --> 04:32:50.140]   At the time, it wasn't synthesized.
[04:32:50.140 --> 04:32:55.140]   It was later in 2003 synthesized, named Moscovium.
[04:32:56.700 --> 04:32:58.180]   He said that the propulsion system
[04:32:58.180 --> 04:33:01.340]   relied on a stable isotope of element 115,
[04:33:01.340 --> 04:33:03.580]   which allegedly generates a gravity wave
[04:33:03.580 --> 04:33:05.100]   that allowed the vehicle to fly
[04:33:05.100 --> 04:33:08.820]   and to evade visual detection by bending light around it.
[04:33:08.820 --> 04:33:13.380]   No stable isotopes of Moscovium have yet been synthesized.
[04:33:13.380 --> 04:33:15.460]   All have proven extremely radioactive,
[04:33:15.460 --> 04:33:18.660]   decaying in a few hundred milliseconds.
[04:33:18.660 --> 04:33:21.620]   One, do you believe him?
[04:33:21.620 --> 04:33:24.140]   Which I find him fascinating
[04:33:24.140 --> 04:33:28.500]   because I find the human mind even more fascinating
[04:33:28.500 --> 04:33:34.580]   than something like an antimatter drive
[04:33:34.580 --> 04:33:36.340]   'cause I think it's such a giant mystery
[04:33:36.340 --> 04:33:38.780]   that we haven't even begun to explore deeply.
[04:33:38.780 --> 04:33:42.820]   Anyway, in that sense, whether he's lying or not
[04:33:42.820 --> 04:33:45.260]   are both interesting things to explore
[04:33:45.260 --> 04:33:47.140]   from a psychology perspective.
[04:33:47.140 --> 04:33:52.140]   But two, he's basically saying that I guess it's an alien,
[04:33:53.140 --> 04:33:57.460]   extraterrestrial engine thing.
[04:33:57.460 --> 04:34:01.020]   What do you think?
[04:34:01.020 --> 04:34:03.420]   - I mean, I'm happy to change my opinion
[04:34:03.420 --> 04:34:05.400]   based on new evidence at any point.
[04:34:05.400 --> 04:34:10.100]   The biggest part of me wants to just be like,
[04:34:10.100 --> 04:34:12.740]   this is obviously just stupid and a hoax
[04:34:12.740 --> 04:34:14.680]   and just total quack.
[04:34:14.680 --> 04:34:18.020]   And then another part of me still is like,
[04:34:18.020 --> 04:34:21.340]   this is exciting and fun to think that this is all real.
[04:34:21.340 --> 04:34:22.300]   And then another part of me goes,
[04:34:22.300 --> 04:34:26.620]   why, how good is this guy at lying and making stuff up?
[04:34:26.620 --> 04:34:29.260]   'Cause it's all really good.
[04:34:29.260 --> 04:34:31.060]   Like good storytelling, good like,
[04:34:31.060 --> 04:34:32.520]   I don't know what to think, honestly.
[04:34:32.520 --> 04:34:35.300]   I don't know, I'm really very skeptical
[04:34:35.300 --> 04:34:37.200]   about anyone explaining anything like this.
[04:34:37.200 --> 04:34:41.080]   Like, I mean, my radar is like screaming at me like,
[04:34:41.080 --> 04:34:44.420]   this is all full crap, you know?
[04:34:44.420 --> 04:34:46.220]   But I'd say like, there's still a part of me
[04:34:46.220 --> 04:34:48.500]   that's just like, man, that is kind of cool.
[04:34:48.500 --> 04:34:49.620]   How does he know that?
[04:34:49.620 --> 04:34:51.660]   And like, you know what I mean?
[04:34:51.660 --> 04:34:52.500]   - Well, I think you're actually--
[04:34:52.500 --> 04:34:53.320]   - I'm conflicted.
[04:34:53.320 --> 04:34:55.060]   - I think you're actually in the best kind of place
[04:34:55.060 --> 04:34:58.660]   'cause it's, I'm afraid of being the kind of person
[04:34:58.660 --> 04:35:01.020]   that hears something like that and says,
[04:35:01.020 --> 04:35:04.740]   it's definitely, he's definitely full of crap
[04:35:04.740 --> 04:35:07.260]   and basically closed my mind off to all that stuff.
[04:35:07.260 --> 04:35:09.880]   I'm afraid of being somebody who closes my mind off
[04:35:09.880 --> 04:35:13.820]   to a thing that's actually a early thread
[04:35:13.820 --> 04:35:16.500]   to a brilliant, to a future,
[04:35:16.500 --> 04:35:19.680]   to a fascinating solution to a mystery.
[04:35:19.680 --> 04:35:23.500]   So, but in this case, I mean, I have so many red flags
[04:35:23.500 --> 04:35:26.000]   from a psychological perspective that,
[04:35:26.000 --> 04:35:31.860]   but again, outside of this particular individual,
[04:35:31.860 --> 04:35:34.120]   I do wonder if aliens have visited us.
[04:35:34.120 --> 04:35:37.220]   I think aliens are everywhere.
[04:35:37.220 --> 04:35:41.020]   I think the universe is teeming with alien life.
[04:35:41.020 --> 04:35:44.420]   I mean, there's, it's very difficult for me
[04:35:44.420 --> 04:35:46.460]   to statistically understand,
[04:35:46.460 --> 04:35:51.460]   given how life finds a way here on earth,
[04:35:51.460 --> 04:35:55.740]   just everywhere, the entire history of life on earth,
[04:35:55.740 --> 04:35:57.980]   from the very origin of life,
[04:35:57.980 --> 04:36:01.220]   it seems to be damn good at doing its thing,
[04:36:01.220 --> 04:36:03.540]   evolving to get better and better and better
[04:36:03.540 --> 04:36:04.600]   at doing its thing.
[04:36:04.600 --> 04:36:06.680]   Now, there could be some special aspects
[04:36:06.680 --> 04:36:08.380]   to the origin of life itself,
[04:36:08.380 --> 04:36:10.220]   which is completely not understood.
[04:36:10.220 --> 04:36:13.840]   So maybe the true magic is in the origin of life,
[04:36:13.840 --> 04:36:17.140]   or it could be that there's some magical leaps
[04:36:17.140 --> 04:36:19.780]   to eukaryotic cells, for example,
[04:36:19.780 --> 04:36:23.420]   that the universe, our galaxy's teeming with alien life,
[04:36:23.420 --> 04:36:24.760]   but it's all bacteria.
[04:36:24.760 --> 04:36:27.620]   They're all boring bacteria or exciting bacteria.
[04:36:27.620 --> 04:36:29.460]   No offense to bacteria.
[04:36:29.460 --> 04:36:32.820]   But the no intelligence spacefaring civilizations.
[04:36:32.820 --> 04:36:35.860]   I don't know, but I just, if I were to guess,
[04:36:35.860 --> 04:36:37.740]   if I had to bet all my money,
[04:36:37.740 --> 04:36:40.980]   there is spacefaring civilizations
[04:36:40.980 --> 04:36:42.980]   everywhere in the universe.
[04:36:42.980 --> 04:36:46.700]   And the fact that they have not been
[04:36:46.700 --> 04:36:51.700]   directly definitively observed confuses me.
[04:36:51.700 --> 04:36:53.340]   And I think it's a mystery.
[04:36:53.340 --> 04:36:57.440]   And if I were to suggest what the solution to that mystery is
[04:36:57.440 --> 04:37:00.740]   is they might look extremely different from us.
[04:37:00.740 --> 04:37:03.320]   And we might be too dumb to detect them.
[04:37:03.320 --> 04:37:04.860]   - Yeah.
[04:37:04.860 --> 04:37:08.560]   - And so there, I think you have to be extremely open-minded
[04:37:08.560 --> 04:37:11.640]   at what would we be looking for.
[04:37:11.640 --> 04:37:12.480]   - Right.
[04:37:13.180 --> 04:37:16.580]   - And that's a very practical thing to be open-minded about.
[04:37:16.580 --> 04:37:21.240]   And practically speaking, if we were to be able to
[04:37:21.240 --> 04:37:23.280]   even detect them from a distance,
[04:37:23.280 --> 04:37:26.920]   get a techno signature of a distant planet,
[04:37:26.920 --> 04:37:30.280]   of a distant star system that has alien life,
[04:37:30.280 --> 04:37:34.700]   honestly, the number one thing I kinda wanna know
[04:37:34.700 --> 04:37:37.340]   is like, what's your propulsion system?
[04:37:37.340 --> 04:37:39.440]   (both laughing)
[04:37:39.440 --> 04:37:41.000]   How do we travel faster, right?
[04:37:41.000 --> 04:37:42.840]   Like, there's a bunch of details probably,
[04:37:42.840 --> 04:37:45.360]   but first, let's get together.
[04:37:45.360 --> 04:37:46.840]   - And teach me how to go fast.
[04:37:46.840 --> 04:37:47.680]   - Go fast.
[04:37:47.680 --> 04:37:48.840]   - I like motorcycles, I like rockets.
[04:37:48.840 --> 04:37:50.520]   Tell me what you got, yeah.
[04:37:50.520 --> 04:37:52.400]   - Yeah, like how, like, I'll show you mine
[04:37:52.400 --> 04:37:53.880]   if you show me yours kind of thing.
[04:37:53.880 --> 04:37:57.720]   At the interstellar, intergalactic level.
[04:37:57.720 --> 04:38:00.440]   Yeah, anyway, I just wonder,
[04:38:00.440 --> 04:38:04.840]   maybe it's a cheat code in this video game we call life,
[04:38:04.840 --> 04:38:07.600]   but I wanna use the cheat code to figure out
[04:38:07.600 --> 04:38:09.720]   what kind of propulsion systems are possible.
[04:38:09.720 --> 04:38:12.480]   And it feels like other alien civilizations
[04:38:12.480 --> 04:38:15.060]   might help us, give us,
[04:38:15.060 --> 04:38:20.000]   give us a guidance on that.
[04:38:20.000 --> 04:38:23.880]   Of course, I think even just discovering,
[04:38:23.880 --> 04:38:26.820]   boy, one of the things with the space program,
[04:38:26.820 --> 04:38:29.180]   like everything we're doing with Mars,
[04:38:29.180 --> 04:38:31.400]   like the secret thing I'm really excited about,
[04:38:31.400 --> 04:38:33.280]   the romantic thing is humans on Mars,
[04:38:33.280 --> 04:38:37.620]   but the secret thing is building giant stations on Mars
[04:38:37.620 --> 04:38:42.280]   that allow us to definitively, hopefully find
[04:38:42.280 --> 04:38:47.280]   the traces of life that either currently doesn't live
[04:38:47.280 --> 04:38:48.920]   or has once lived on Mars.
[04:38:48.920 --> 04:38:50.840]   Because if that's the case,
[04:38:50.840 --> 04:38:53.080]   that means for sure life is everywhere.
[04:38:53.080 --> 04:38:53.920]   - Oh, 100%.
[04:38:53.920 --> 04:38:56.360]   - And then you're like, once you know that,
[04:38:56.360 --> 04:38:58.680]   sorry to keep interrupting, not shutting the hell up.
[04:38:58.680 --> 04:39:00.640]   This is supposed to be an interview, goddammit.
[04:39:00.640 --> 04:39:05.500]   All right, that, like, that, just the knowledge of that,
[04:39:05.500 --> 04:39:08.880]   just the knowledge that a four minute mile can be run,
[04:39:08.880 --> 04:39:11.520]   I think will open our minds completely
[04:39:11.520 --> 04:39:15.480]   to really, really hardcore push to interstellar travel
[04:39:15.480 --> 04:39:18.820]   or colonizing Mars, becoming a multi-planetary species.
[04:39:18.820 --> 04:39:20.920]   It'd be truly inspiring.
[04:39:20.920 --> 04:39:22.040]   - You think that.
[04:39:22.040 --> 04:39:25.920]   Do you get nervous, though?
[04:39:25.920 --> 04:39:27.320]   I'm the interviewer now.
[04:39:27.320 --> 04:39:30.340]   Don't you get nervous that we could make
[04:39:30.340 --> 04:39:31.960]   spectacular discovery on Mars
[04:39:31.960 --> 04:39:33.880]   that not only has there been life,
[04:39:33.880 --> 04:39:37.000]   there's actually pretty advanced micro,
[04:39:37.000 --> 04:39:41.320]   or multi-cellular life totally thriving in certain regions
[04:39:41.320 --> 04:39:42.840]   we just hadn't visited on Mars,
[04:39:42.840 --> 04:39:44.320]   and we make this big discovery,
[04:39:44.320 --> 04:39:48.280]   that a relatively large percentage of people
[04:39:48.280 --> 04:39:49.880]   just simply wouldn't believe it.
[04:39:49.880 --> 04:39:52.940]   They'd think it's all 100% fake,
[04:39:52.940 --> 04:39:55.120]   and that they're just doing this to control us,
[04:39:55.120 --> 04:39:56.480]   and that blah, blah, blah.
[04:39:56.480 --> 04:39:59.560]   We could make the most important discovery
[04:39:59.560 --> 04:40:03.360]   in human life, in all of human existence,
[04:40:03.360 --> 04:40:05.900]   that we're not alone in this universe,
[04:40:05.900 --> 04:40:09.280]   cellularly at least.
[04:40:09.280 --> 04:40:10.960]   And a good percentage of people,
[04:40:10.960 --> 04:40:14.480]   I'm thinking 20, 30, in today's world,
[04:40:14.480 --> 04:40:18.920]   40 plus percent of people wouldn't even believe it existed.
[04:40:18.920 --> 04:40:19.760]   - Interesting.
[04:40:19.760 --> 04:40:23.520]   It's just a very important thing to think about,
[04:40:23.520 --> 04:40:26.280]   especially as an educator like yourself.
[04:40:26.280 --> 04:40:28.880]   I think the current cynicism
[04:40:28.880 --> 04:40:31.600]   towards institutions and science is temporary.
[04:40:31.600 --> 04:40:35.220]   I think it's, they're basically, the internet woke up,
[04:40:35.220 --> 04:40:37.200]   the internet smells bullshit,
[04:40:37.200 --> 04:40:40.800]   and it looked at, I'm sorry I'm not being ageist,
[04:40:40.800 --> 04:40:43.480]   but saying older scientists, and they looked at them,
[04:40:43.480 --> 04:40:45.840]   and they kind of said, you're kind of full of shit.
[04:40:45.840 --> 04:40:50.160]   You got a lot of ego, you speak down to everybody,
[04:40:50.160 --> 04:40:52.160]   you're not very good at communicating.
[04:40:52.160 --> 04:40:54.720]   I think there's a lot of truth to what they're saying,
[04:40:54.720 --> 04:40:57.120]   and I think the young scientists that are coming up
[04:40:57.120 --> 04:40:59.420]   will be much better at not being full of shit,
[04:40:59.420 --> 04:41:00.940]   being authentic, being real,
[04:41:00.940 --> 04:41:04.020]   not treating people like they're children
[04:41:04.020 --> 04:41:05.200]   that can't possibly understand,
[04:41:05.200 --> 04:41:06.960]   like taking it very seriously,
[04:41:06.960 --> 04:41:09.120]   that there's a lot of intelligent people out there
[04:41:09.120 --> 04:41:13.220]   that are curious, that are full of desire for knowledge,
[04:41:13.220 --> 04:41:16.100]   like being transparent about all the uncertainties
[04:41:16.100 --> 04:41:19.780]   of the scientific process, all the tensions,
[04:41:19.780 --> 04:41:21.220]   the conflicts, all of that.
[04:41:21.220 --> 04:41:26.220]   And I think once we fix the science communication system,
[04:41:27.980 --> 04:41:32.220]   adapt it to the internet, I think that won't be an issue.
[04:41:32.220 --> 04:41:33.700]   I hope, I hope.
[04:41:33.700 --> 04:41:36.160]   I mean, that's why people like you are really important,
[04:41:36.160 --> 04:41:38.560]   is like communicate with authenticity.
[04:41:38.560 --> 04:41:42.360]   But yeah, that's definitely something to think about.
[04:41:42.360 --> 04:41:46.240]   I mean, yes, the early, I mean, listen, scientists too,
[04:41:46.240 --> 04:41:49.260]   like the phosphine discovered on Venus,
[04:41:49.260 --> 04:41:52.460]   is like they're extremely skeptical always.
[04:41:52.460 --> 04:41:55.380]   So definitely there'll be a lot of skepticism.
[04:41:55.380 --> 04:41:57.780]   And it depends what it looks like.
[04:41:57.780 --> 04:41:59.460]   If it kind of looks like,
[04:41:59.460 --> 04:42:02.460]   this thing kind of looks like bacteria back on Earth.
[04:42:02.460 --> 04:42:04.700]   Yes, so it means contamination
[04:42:04.700 --> 04:42:06.700]   is very difficult to avoid in general.
[04:42:06.700 --> 04:42:10.160]   But if the thing looks like fundamentally different,
[04:42:10.160 --> 04:42:11.860]   then you're like, all right.
[04:42:11.860 --> 04:42:16.180]   - Yeah, totally different DNA, RNA, like this is not,
[04:42:16.180 --> 04:42:18.620]   we've never observed this ever at all.
[04:42:18.620 --> 04:42:22.040]   - Then you're like, all right, cool.
[04:42:22.040 --> 04:42:25.860]   Of course, so that, another promising thing
[04:42:25.860 --> 04:42:28.420]   that's difficult to be definitive about,
[04:42:28.420 --> 04:42:32.500]   but as we get better and better direct imaging systems,
[04:42:32.500 --> 04:42:34.820]   there's now, I don't know how many,
[04:42:34.820 --> 04:42:38.460]   but thousands of planets being discovered
[04:42:38.460 --> 04:42:40.020]   outside of our solar system.
[04:42:40.020 --> 04:42:41.380]   There's moons being discovered,
[04:42:41.380 --> 04:42:43.420]   now Earth-like planets being discovered.
[04:42:43.420 --> 04:42:44.500]   So like all of that,
[04:42:44.500 --> 04:42:47.020]   if we could do direct imaging of those planets,
[04:42:47.020 --> 04:42:51.180]   more and more and more, there could be some gigantic,
[04:42:51.180 --> 04:42:54.100]   listen, if there is like a Kardashev,
[04:42:54.100 --> 04:42:55.780]   like type two civilization,
[04:42:55.780 --> 04:42:57.260]   we're gonna see the damn thing.
[04:42:57.260 --> 04:42:59.940]   It's gonna be producing a lot of,
[04:42:59.940 --> 04:43:02.500]   it's gonna be radiating a lot of energy.
[04:43:02.500 --> 04:43:04.700]   So the possibility of detecting some of that,
[04:43:04.700 --> 04:43:06.980]   that's also a real possibility
[04:43:06.980 --> 04:43:08.780]   with something like James Webb telescopes,
[04:43:08.780 --> 04:43:10.420]   like those kinds of efforts,
[04:43:10.420 --> 04:43:12.340]   that starts becoming a reality.
[04:43:12.340 --> 04:43:14.660]   - Have you read Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary"?
[04:43:14.660 --> 04:43:15.900]   - I have not, no.
[04:43:15.900 --> 04:43:18.220]   - You're going to love it.
[04:43:18.220 --> 04:43:23.180]   Like it is basically, almost answering that like,
[04:43:23.180 --> 04:43:25.660]   how could they not see us type of thing almost,
[04:43:25.660 --> 04:43:28.140]   where he creates this incredible,
[04:43:28.140 --> 04:43:29.060]   I don't want to spoil anything,
[04:43:29.060 --> 04:43:33.900]   but it's just the sense that like,
[04:43:33.900 --> 04:43:35.500]   we could have totally different perspectives
[04:43:35.500 --> 04:43:39.380]   with an alien race and not even like consider that,
[04:43:39.380 --> 04:43:42.300]   you know, the two of us are coexisting almost.
[04:43:42.300 --> 04:43:43.140]   I don't want to spoil anything,
[04:43:43.140 --> 04:43:45.660]   'cause it's really, really, really worth the read.
[04:43:45.660 --> 04:43:47.100]   - Oh, you mean a different perspective,
[04:43:47.100 --> 04:43:49.620]   like the aliens have a different perspective than humans?
[04:43:49.620 --> 04:43:52.980]   - Yeah, like we just like, we see with this visual light.
[04:43:52.980 --> 04:43:54.980]   Someone could see in X-ray, et cetera.
[04:43:54.980 --> 04:43:57.860]   You know, like, and just the way we even come
[04:43:57.860 --> 04:44:01.100]   to the same perspective, like looking and observing
[04:44:01.100 --> 04:44:03.700]   is just so different fundamentally,
[04:44:03.700 --> 04:44:06.220]   that like we could, I mean, it's not quite like that.
[04:44:06.220 --> 04:44:07.180]   It's not like it's like, oh,
[04:44:07.180 --> 04:44:08.660]   they were actually on the Moon and we're,
[04:44:08.660 --> 04:44:09.580]   you know, it's nothing like that.
[04:44:09.580 --> 04:44:14.180]   But it's such a unique and incredible story.
[04:44:14.180 --> 04:44:16.620]   I think Andy Weir's one of the best
[04:44:16.620 --> 04:44:18.060]   science fiction writers, I don't,
[04:44:18.060 --> 04:44:19.220]   I can't say that with much authority,
[04:44:19.220 --> 04:44:21.700]   'cause I don't listen to much science fiction.
[04:44:21.700 --> 04:44:22.780]   So zero authority.
[04:44:22.780 --> 04:44:24.380]   I really like Andy Weir's books,
[04:44:24.380 --> 04:44:25.220]   and that book is no different.
[04:44:25.220 --> 04:44:27.300]   - But that sounds like, I'm really worried about that.
[04:44:27.300 --> 04:44:30.180]   It sounds like I would really love it.
[04:44:30.180 --> 04:44:32.520]   I've definitely, I've been very,
[04:44:32.520 --> 04:44:35.340]   I've done a lot of reading in my life,
[04:44:35.340 --> 04:44:37.140]   but like the science fiction is one of the things
[04:44:37.140 --> 04:44:38.660]   I've been really, really weak on.
[04:44:38.660 --> 04:44:39.940]   I haven't really read much,
[04:44:39.940 --> 04:44:41.780]   and I just made more and more friends
[04:44:41.780 --> 04:44:46.060]   over the years recently that say
[04:44:46.060 --> 04:44:48.460]   that I absolutely must read some of these things.
[04:44:48.460 --> 04:44:50.000]   - Are you, do you physically read,
[04:44:50.000 --> 04:44:51.980]   or do you do audio books while you run and stuff?
[04:44:51.980 --> 04:44:53.620]   - I do both, yeah.
[04:44:53.620 --> 04:44:55.780]   Well, physically, I sadly don't.
[04:44:55.780 --> 04:44:56.900]   It's a Kindle, right?
[04:44:56.900 --> 04:44:58.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:44:58.020 --> 04:45:02.020]   - Yeah, but while I run, I also do,
[04:45:02.020 --> 04:45:02.860]   so I do both.
[04:45:02.860 --> 04:45:06.380]   I do about, on a normal day,
[04:45:06.380 --> 04:45:09.780]   especially now that I've been really focused on reading,
[04:45:09.780 --> 04:45:14.780]   it's about 60 minutes of reading on a Kindle,
[04:45:14.780 --> 04:45:19.900]   and one to two hours, 'cause I run about two hours,
[04:45:19.900 --> 04:45:21.860]   when I don't have like other stuff.
[04:45:21.860 --> 04:45:24.700]   Like today, I won't run, so it's about three hours.
[04:45:24.700 --> 04:45:26.420]   So on average, I would say it's like two,
[04:45:26.420 --> 04:45:28.740]   two and a half hours a day that I read,
[04:45:28.740 --> 04:45:30.060]   and audio books are just the same.
[04:45:30.060 --> 04:45:32.580]   They're a little slower, but they can,
[04:45:32.580 --> 04:45:33.620]   especially for the classics,
[04:45:33.620 --> 04:45:36.260]   they can capture some of the magic with a deep voice,
[04:45:36.260 --> 04:45:37.700]   usually with a British accent.
[04:45:37.700 --> 04:45:38.540]   I love it.
[04:45:38.540 --> 04:45:41.400]   I also read that, listened to, sorry,
[04:45:41.400 --> 04:45:45.680]   that a book on propulsion like two years ago, I remember,
[04:45:45.680 --> 04:45:48.140]   but I remember that was extremely difficult to--
[04:45:48.140 --> 04:45:48.980]   - Ignition?
[04:45:48.980 --> 04:45:50.060]   - Yeah, it was Ignition.
[04:45:50.060 --> 04:45:50.900]   - By Don D. Clarke?
[04:45:50.900 --> 04:45:52.860]   - Yeah, it was very difficult to listen.
[04:45:52.860 --> 04:45:54.500]   - Oh, yeah, I see, I don't read,
[04:45:54.500 --> 04:45:56.220]   I listen while I'm on road trips or running
[04:45:56.220 --> 04:45:59.980]   or stuff like that too, so I swear there's probably 40,
[04:45:59.980 --> 04:46:02.340]   or like not 40, but there's like eight minutes of,
[04:46:02.340 --> 04:46:07.340]   we tried PMZ 15, 13, BM 412, RMNL,
[04:46:07.340 --> 04:46:11.540]   mitral muscle hydrogen, for like,
[04:46:11.540 --> 04:46:14.780]   I swear it's multiple minutes of explaining one trial
[04:46:14.780 --> 04:46:16.700]   on something, 'cause there's just so many
[04:46:16.700 --> 04:46:19.140]   different chemicals they try, I don't know,
[04:46:19.140 --> 04:46:22.040]   it's almost a joke, I literally audibly laughed out loud
[04:46:22.040 --> 04:46:24.380]   listening to it, 'cause I'm like, this is so ridiculous,
[04:46:24.380 --> 04:46:25.540]   I'm sure it makes sense reading it,
[04:46:25.540 --> 04:46:27.860]   but like listening to it is just hilarious,
[04:46:27.860 --> 04:46:28.960]   but it's great though.
[04:46:28.960 --> 04:46:31.860]   - What do you think of some of the challenges
[04:46:31.860 --> 04:46:33.660]   for long-term space travel?
[04:46:33.660 --> 04:46:36.340]   Do you think about this kind of stuff, the biological stuff?
[04:46:36.340 --> 04:46:37.520]   - Yeah.
[04:46:37.520 --> 04:46:40.860]   - Do you worry, do you think about radiation on Mars
[04:46:40.860 --> 04:46:45.680]   and out in space over periods of,
[04:46:45.680 --> 04:46:47.460]   actually the effects on the human body,
[04:46:47.460 --> 04:46:51.100]   forget even the radiation, over periods of months and years?
[04:46:51.100 --> 04:46:51.940]   - Yeah.
[04:46:51.940 --> 04:46:56.620]   I think realistically we have a really good handle
[04:46:56.620 --> 04:46:59.660]   on what the effects are,
[04:46:59.660 --> 04:47:02.460]   and we actually have the solution to like everything,
[04:47:02.460 --> 04:47:05.740]   it's just whether or not we can,
[04:47:05.740 --> 04:47:08.380]   like for instance, low Earth orbit,
[04:47:08.380 --> 04:47:10.420]   one of the biggest challenges eventually
[04:47:10.420 --> 04:47:12.500]   after your long-term space travel
[04:47:12.500 --> 04:47:15.180]   is bone density loss and not having gravity,
[04:47:15.180 --> 04:47:18.140]   you actually have issues with a handful of things,
[04:47:18.140 --> 04:47:22.180]   and artificial gravity is easy in terms of,
[04:47:22.180 --> 04:47:24.740]   relatively easy in terms of space flight.
[04:47:24.740 --> 04:47:27.940]   You can have two vehicles just tethered together
[04:47:27.940 --> 04:47:31.540]   and just spinning, given enough distance
[04:47:31.540 --> 04:47:33.560]   and a decent enough spin velocity,
[04:47:33.560 --> 04:47:37.400]   and you can get one gene relatively easy,
[04:47:37.400 --> 04:47:39.020]   we're talking again, relatively easy,
[04:47:39.020 --> 04:47:40.580]   especially after talking about theoretical physics,
[04:47:40.580 --> 04:47:43.020]   like this is, that's easy stuff.
[04:47:43.020 --> 04:47:44.500]   We haven't done that yet,
[04:47:44.500 --> 04:47:46.780]   but like there's no reason
[04:47:46.780 --> 04:47:48.460]   why we can't produce artificial gravity.
[04:47:48.460 --> 04:47:52.140]   If we say that that's a big enough hurdle
[04:47:52.140 --> 04:47:54.140]   that we absolutely have to overcome this,
[04:47:54.140 --> 04:47:56.540]   okay, cool, we'll just spin up two vehicles
[04:47:56.540 --> 04:47:58.940]   that are going to Mars and people will have,
[04:47:58.940 --> 04:48:00.980]   but that's the thing is Mars is only about,
[04:48:00.980 --> 04:48:03.180]   we'll say six months there,
[04:48:03.180 --> 04:48:04.340]   then you're hanging out on Mars,
[04:48:04.340 --> 04:48:08.060]   you have 38% of gravity, and then six months-ish back.
[04:48:08.060 --> 04:48:10.660]   People live on the International Space Station
[04:48:10.660 --> 04:48:11.560]   at six months stints,
[04:48:11.560 --> 04:48:13.300]   we've had people for basically a year
[04:48:13.300 --> 04:48:15.060]   up on the International Space Station.
[04:48:15.060 --> 04:48:17.620]   It's not like it's, it's not life altering.
[04:48:17.620 --> 04:48:18.760]   Yeah, you have a couple days
[04:48:18.760 --> 04:48:20.980]   of not being able to walk very well,
[04:48:20.980 --> 04:48:22.620]   and you do have some bone density loss
[04:48:22.620 --> 04:48:24.260]   and some other concerns,
[04:48:24.260 --> 04:48:26.900]   but like again, that's, it's solvable.
[04:48:26.900 --> 04:48:30.040]   And I think, you know, the first missions to Mars,
[04:48:30.040 --> 04:48:33.540]   I think it might, we might, we'll probably do the trade.
[04:48:33.540 --> 04:48:35.420]   Is it worth it to like land on Mars
[04:48:35.420 --> 04:48:36.860]   and have a crippled crew
[04:48:36.860 --> 04:48:39.140]   that can't even physically stand yet,
[04:48:39.140 --> 04:48:41.060]   you know, for a day or two
[04:48:41.060 --> 04:48:43.460]   before they get their feet from underneath them?
[04:48:43.460 --> 04:48:47.020]   Or is it, do we need to spin up two spacecraft
[04:48:47.020 --> 04:48:48.980]   or you know, a tether and have,
[04:48:48.980 --> 04:48:50.220]   like you can't do it like Starship,
[04:48:50.220 --> 04:48:52.600]   you know, even though it's 30 feet wide or nine meters wide.
[04:48:52.600 --> 04:48:55.300]   If you spin it on that one axis,
[04:48:55.300 --> 04:48:59.100]   that's not enough space to get 1G
[04:48:59.100 --> 04:49:00.340]   without your feet and your head
[04:49:00.340 --> 04:49:02.460]   being at two different velocities,
[04:49:02.460 --> 04:49:03.900]   so you get really sick,
[04:49:03.900 --> 04:49:05.380]   you always feel like you're falling.
[04:49:05.380 --> 04:49:08.340]   Your brain will tell you that you're falling constantly.
[04:49:08.340 --> 04:49:09.740]   But then again, okay, so this is,
[04:49:09.740 --> 04:49:11.500]   this is the whole thing is,
[04:49:11.500 --> 04:49:13.340]   you know, and I don't know if there's,
[04:49:13.340 --> 04:49:15.420]   we don't really have the data yet on like,
[04:49:15.420 --> 04:49:17.740]   going from zero G, we know the effects of that.
[04:49:17.740 --> 04:49:19.820]   We know the effects of 1G really well,
[04:49:19.820 --> 04:49:22.180]   that's our majority of our data set.
[04:49:22.180 --> 04:49:23.360]   But we don't really have much data
[04:49:23.360 --> 04:49:26.220]   on the long-term effects of, you know,
[04:49:26.220 --> 04:49:29.300]   one sixth gravity, like on the Moon, or 38% gravity.
[04:49:29.300 --> 04:49:31.860]   Is it, is one sixth gravity actually enough
[04:49:31.860 --> 04:49:36.020]   to counteract 95% of the effects of low gravity?
[04:49:36.020 --> 04:49:38.620]   Or is it 15, you know, is it one sixth?
[04:49:38.620 --> 04:49:40.140]   Is it like a linear thing?
[04:49:40.140 --> 04:49:42.980]   Is 38% gravity totally, you know,
[04:49:42.980 --> 04:49:45.620]   38% as bad as one or whatever, you know,
[04:49:45.620 --> 04:49:48.540]   is it a slight, like where is the doubt on the scale?
[04:49:48.540 --> 04:49:50.000]   So there's a chance that we don't need
[04:49:50.000 --> 04:49:52.700]   anywhere near 1G of gravity to counteract
[04:49:52.700 --> 04:49:54.220]   the bulk majority of these problems.
[04:49:54.220 --> 04:49:57.020]   We could have 0.1G or whatever is the,
[04:49:57.020 --> 04:50:01.440]   you know, the right compromise of vehicle complexity
[04:50:01.440 --> 04:50:05.380]   and human biology and all of these other effects.
[04:50:05.380 --> 04:50:07.620]   Like we, this is absolutely a solvable thing.
[04:50:07.620 --> 04:50:10.540]   - That is, and we figure some of this out
[04:50:10.540 --> 04:50:11.900]   through just experimentation.
[04:50:11.900 --> 04:50:13.340]   - 100%. - Along the way.
[04:50:13.340 --> 04:50:14.180]   - Yep.
[04:50:14.180 --> 04:50:15.720]   - One of this is back to my dating life.
[04:50:15.720 --> 04:50:18.640]   I think one of the essential fundamental research questions
[04:50:18.640 --> 04:50:23.640]   I'm wondering about is the dynamics and,
[04:50:23.640 --> 04:50:27.840]   so the details of how you have sex in space.
[04:50:27.840 --> 04:50:30.700]   Asking for a friend, of course.
[04:50:30.700 --> 04:50:33.700]   I mean, there literally is sort of work on this, right?
[04:50:33.700 --> 04:50:37.140]   'Cause like, if you think about long-term space travel,
[04:50:37.140 --> 04:50:42.140]   I mean, sex is sort of like,
[04:50:42.140 --> 04:50:43.860]   there's the recreational aspect of sex,
[04:50:43.860 --> 04:50:46.160]   but the most important aspect of sex
[04:50:46.160 --> 04:50:50.220]   for long-term space travel is procreation
[04:50:50.220 --> 04:50:54.120]   is, and also the full biological cycle of that.
[04:50:54.120 --> 04:50:56.740]   So from the embryo, the development of the baby,
[04:50:56.740 --> 04:50:59.040]   the giving the birth and all that kind of stuff.
[04:50:59.040 --> 04:51:02.980]   So like, you know, there's a lot of really difficult
[04:51:02.980 --> 04:51:06.900]   problems of biology there to understand.
[04:51:06.900 --> 04:51:08.540]   And perhaps to solve.
[04:51:08.540 --> 04:51:11.060]   Some of that, again, just like you said brilliantly,
[04:51:11.060 --> 04:51:13.580]   some of that can be just solved with engineering
[04:51:13.580 --> 04:51:14.620]   outside of the human body
[04:51:14.620 --> 04:51:18.260]   by creating a gravitational field like that.
[04:51:18.260 --> 04:51:19.460]   But maybe along the way,
[04:51:19.460 --> 04:51:21.860]   you can figure out how to do that without doing it,
[04:51:21.860 --> 04:51:23.500]   but with balancing the cost and so on.
[04:51:23.500 --> 04:51:25.500]   - And radiation's the other thing.
[04:51:25.500 --> 04:51:28.540]   We know, we have a really good data set
[04:51:28.540 --> 04:51:31.020]   on what radiation and doses do to humans.
[04:51:31.020 --> 04:51:32.220]   Like, we know.
[04:51:32.220 --> 04:51:33.280]   We can measure radiation.
[04:51:33.280 --> 04:51:35.340]   We know, we can approximate, you know,
[04:51:35.340 --> 04:51:38.180]   and kind of give edge cases for the Mars transient
[04:51:38.180 --> 04:51:40.060]   and getting to Mars and being on Mars.
[04:51:40.060 --> 04:51:42.360]   And the simple answer to that is like,
[04:51:42.360 --> 04:51:44.740]   at the end of the day, if we have to, you know,
[04:51:44.740 --> 04:51:48.140]   dig into Mars or find a tunnel to live in
[04:51:48.140 --> 04:51:50.100]   so you get some extra mass in between you
[04:51:50.100 --> 04:51:52.140]   and cosmic radiation, so be it.
[04:51:52.140 --> 04:51:53.620]   Like, that's the answer then.
[04:51:53.620 --> 04:51:56.500]   Again, none of these are like insolvable problems.
[04:51:56.500 --> 04:51:59.220]   They're just things, hurdles you would have to overcome
[04:51:59.220 --> 04:52:02.260]   based on, you know, the risk exposure
[04:52:02.260 --> 04:52:04.060]   and the posture there.
[04:52:04.060 --> 04:52:08.580]   - Imagine being the first child,
[04:52:08.580 --> 04:52:11.980]   the first baby born outside of Earth.
[04:52:11.980 --> 04:52:13.780]   That'd be pretty cool.
[04:52:13.780 --> 04:52:14.620]   - Yeah, that'd be--
[04:52:14.620 --> 04:52:17.500]   - I would love to be alive to see that.
[04:52:17.500 --> 04:52:18.660]   - That'd be a big one.
[04:52:18.660 --> 04:52:19.960]   - I don't know if they'll,
[04:52:19.960 --> 04:52:24.860]   I don't know, 'cause it's such a dangerous thing.
[04:52:24.860 --> 04:52:25.980]   It's so risky.
[04:52:25.980 --> 04:52:27.820]   - I think that could be in our lifetime.
[04:52:27.820 --> 04:52:28.660]   - You think so?
[04:52:28.660 --> 04:52:29.580]   - Yeah.
[04:52:29.580 --> 04:52:31.500]   I would like to think, in a perfect world,
[04:52:31.500 --> 04:52:35.020]   if we're thinking futurism, that in 30 to 50 years,
[04:52:35.020 --> 04:52:36.900]   I definitely think we could have a full-time,
[04:52:36.900 --> 04:52:40.380]   like, permanent major civilizations,
[04:52:40.380 --> 04:52:44.540]   you know, like what Blue Origin wants to develop,
[04:52:44.540 --> 04:52:47.180]   where they have a huge sphere, you know,
[04:52:47.180 --> 04:52:51.460]   and you're doing a lot of, especially heavy industry
[04:52:51.460 --> 04:52:52.940]   off of Earth so you're not polluting Earth.
[04:52:52.940 --> 04:52:55.100]   Like, that makes so much sense to me.
[04:52:55.100 --> 04:53:00.180]   Yeah, I think we could live in a lifetime
[04:53:00.180 --> 04:53:02.980]   where, you know, we thought that since the '50s and '60s
[04:53:02.980 --> 04:53:04.820]   that people are gonna be living and working in space
[04:53:04.820 --> 04:53:06.780]   like crazy, and at any given point,
[04:53:06.780 --> 04:53:09.020]   we're lucky to have 12 people in space today.
[04:53:09.020 --> 04:53:12.300]   But I really think in our lifetime,
[04:53:12.300 --> 04:53:14.220]   we're finally getting to that point of,
[04:53:14.220 --> 04:53:17.300]   yeah, that that's a reality.
[04:53:17.300 --> 04:53:19.740]   - Let me, 'cause you mentioned Blue Origin,
[04:53:19.740 --> 04:53:23.380]   can we just lay out some of the competitors to SpaceX?
[04:53:23.380 --> 04:53:27.140]   So much of what we talked about is SpaceX,
[04:53:27.140 --> 04:53:28.940]   specifically because they're sort of
[04:53:28.940 --> 04:53:30.460]   pushing the boundaries of what's possible
[04:53:30.460 --> 04:53:31.840]   in the commercial space life.
[04:53:31.840 --> 04:53:33.300]   But there's a lot of, like you said,
[04:53:33.300 --> 04:53:36.100]   incredible work being done for large companies
[04:53:36.100 --> 04:53:38.420]   and small companies, startups, and so on.
[04:53:38.420 --> 04:53:41.020]   So who are the competitors to SpaceX?
[04:53:41.020 --> 04:53:44.060]   ULA, you know, Launch Alliance, Blue Origin,
[04:53:44.060 --> 04:53:47.540]   there's Virgin, is it Galactic Orbit?
[04:53:47.540 --> 04:53:49.580]   - Orbit would be the competitor.
[04:53:49.580 --> 04:53:52.660]   - Virgin Orbit, there's Rocket Labs,
[04:53:52.660 --> 04:53:54.420]   Electron Rocket that you mentioned.
[04:53:54.420 --> 04:53:58.220]   There's the folks you covered, Firefly?
[04:53:58.220 --> 04:53:59.060]   - Yep, yep.
[04:53:59.060 --> 04:54:00.980]   - And what are we missing?
[04:54:00.980 --> 04:54:05.620]   There's the EPIC Space Launch System from NASA,
[04:54:05.620 --> 04:54:06.580]   I guess that is?
[04:54:06.580 --> 04:54:09.100]   - Technically NASA, but prime contractor Boeing.
[04:54:09.100 --> 04:54:10.460]   - Boeing, Lockheed?
[04:54:10.460 --> 04:54:13.380]   - Lockheed, yeah, Northrop is the boosters, yep.
[04:54:13.380 --> 04:54:16.180]   - Nice, so what's interesting to say
[04:54:16.180 --> 04:54:18.580]   to lay out the land here that you're excited about?
[04:54:18.580 --> 04:54:21.260]   - Just in general, I think if you aren't working
[04:54:21.260 --> 04:54:24.020]   on a reusable, some form of reusable vehicle,
[04:54:24.020 --> 04:54:26.940]   like physically working on it, pen to paper,
[04:54:26.940 --> 04:54:29.500]   not beyond pen to paper, like bending metal
[04:54:29.500 --> 04:54:32.620]   for a reusable vehicle, you're gone, you're toast.
[04:54:32.620 --> 04:54:37.420]   I think we're well into that being the only provable
[04:54:37.420 --> 04:54:40.900]   way forward, the only way you're gonna compete
[04:54:40.900 --> 04:54:43.180]   and survive is a reusable rocket.
[04:54:43.180 --> 04:54:44.540]   Fully reusable would be great,
[04:54:44.540 --> 04:54:47.860]   but that's obviously massively aspirational still,
[04:54:47.860 --> 04:54:49.140]   but it will come.
[04:54:49.140 --> 04:54:54.140]   But to me, the list you pretty much had it right on the head,
[04:54:54.820 --> 04:54:57.420]   Astra was another orbital rocket company.
[04:54:57.420 --> 04:55:01.460]   There's a lot of companies, and I think right now
[04:55:01.460 --> 04:55:05.220]   the ones that I personally really believe in,
[04:55:05.220 --> 04:55:08.260]   Rocket Lab is awesome.
[04:55:08.260 --> 04:55:10.900]   I really think that they are one of the few
[04:55:10.900 --> 04:55:13.800]   that I believe can actually build a Falcon 9 class rocket,
[04:55:13.800 --> 04:55:17.820]   like today, with their technology, with their knowledge,
[04:55:17.820 --> 04:55:21.060]   with their investments, with their funding,
[04:55:21.060 --> 04:55:21.980]   and they've proven themselves.
[04:55:21.980 --> 04:55:25.500]   There's very few, they have actually made it look easy.
[04:55:25.500 --> 04:55:27.820]   I think there's a lot of startups and a lot of new rocket.
[04:55:27.820 --> 04:55:29.940]   There's too many launch providers
[04:55:29.940 --> 04:55:31.420]   popping out of the woodwork right now.
[04:55:31.420 --> 04:55:33.500]   They won't all survive, of course.
[04:55:33.500 --> 04:55:35.860]   I think realistically, if you look at like airplanes,
[04:55:35.860 --> 04:55:38.700]   how many airplane, there's a handful
[04:55:38.700 --> 04:55:39.820]   of airplane manufacturers.
[04:55:39.820 --> 04:55:41.420]   There's not hundreds and thousands
[04:55:41.420 --> 04:55:43.100]   of airplane manufacturers.
[04:55:43.100 --> 04:55:44.900]   I think it'll be a similar thing for space flight.
[04:55:44.900 --> 04:55:48.860]   I think we'll see, realistically,
[04:55:48.860 --> 04:55:50.780]   in the terms of jumbo jets and passengers,
[04:55:50.780 --> 04:55:52.340]   there's basically two.
[04:55:52.340 --> 04:55:54.040]   There's Airbus and there's Boeing.
[04:55:54.040 --> 04:55:58.740]   So I think in the long run,
[04:55:58.740 --> 04:56:01.660]   there'll be two or three major players.
[04:56:01.660 --> 04:56:05.820]   I think there'll be 10 minor,
[04:56:05.820 --> 04:56:07.620]   like as far as launch providers,
[04:56:07.620 --> 04:56:09.340]   as far as the ones actually leaving Earth
[04:56:09.340 --> 04:56:10.980]   and getting into orbit, I just don't think
[04:56:10.980 --> 04:56:14.780]   there's a ton of room for individuality, really.
[04:56:14.780 --> 04:56:18.900]   - Yeah, I would love to see a really serious competitor
[04:56:18.900 --> 04:56:21.420]   to SpaceX in the way that SpaceX does things.
[04:56:21.420 --> 04:56:26.420]   I don't know if ULA is quite the right kind of competitor.
[04:56:26.420 --> 04:56:28.540]   - Let me say this.
[04:56:28.540 --> 04:56:31.100]   ULA has all of the potential,
[04:56:31.100 --> 04:56:35.420]   but just operationally, Lockheed Martin and Boeing's
[04:56:35.420 --> 04:56:38.940]   love child, they're kind of set up
[04:56:38.940 --> 04:56:41.380]   in a far too traditional manner,
[04:56:41.380 --> 04:56:43.980]   where they just really aren't given the opportunity
[04:56:43.980 --> 04:56:46.740]   to innovate like a lot of these startups are.
[04:56:46.740 --> 04:56:49.660]   - So Rocket Lab is a little bit more of that nature.
[04:56:49.660 --> 04:56:53.100]   What do you think about just Blue Origin in general?
[04:56:53.100 --> 04:56:54.900]   - Blue Origin's, man.
[04:56:54.900 --> 04:56:59.240]   What Blue Origin has done with New Shepard is amazing,
[04:56:59.240 --> 04:57:02.820]   and people just laud it because it's suborbital
[04:57:02.820 --> 04:57:04.640]   and it looks very phallic.
[04:57:04.640 --> 04:57:10.060]   - So I guess the meme matters also in this modern day.
[04:57:10.060 --> 04:57:11.540]   - But it's sad because people don't see
[04:57:11.540 --> 04:57:14.220]   what they are also working on, which is New Glenn.
[04:57:14.220 --> 04:57:16.780]   I see comments almost every day still of like,
[04:57:16.780 --> 04:57:19.580]   it doesn't matter 'cause they're working on tiny.
[04:57:19.580 --> 04:57:21.760]   It's like, no, New Glenn is more powerful
[04:57:21.760 --> 04:57:23.500]   and more capable than Falcon Heavy.
[04:57:23.500 --> 04:57:26.220]   New Glenn is almost more of a competitor to,
[04:57:26.220 --> 04:57:28.620]   not quite, to Starship, but it's almost in that class.
[04:57:28.620 --> 04:57:31.060]   It's a heavy lift launch vehicle.
[04:57:31.060 --> 04:57:33.780]   It's huge, it's crazy, it'll be nuts.
[04:57:33.780 --> 04:57:35.660]   They're very actively working on it.
[04:57:35.660 --> 04:57:38.700]   I still think we're three years away from it launching,
[04:57:38.700 --> 04:57:40.660]   but that's a very strong competitor
[04:57:40.660 --> 04:57:44.020]   in the class of rockets that SpaceX is currently making.
[04:57:44.020 --> 04:57:45.980]   So SpaceX is currently leading the way,
[04:57:45.980 --> 04:57:49.800]   but it could become a close race.
[04:57:49.800 --> 04:57:53.780]   - For now, we'll ignore SpaceX
[04:57:53.780 --> 04:57:55.100]   and we'll just kind of talk about,
[04:57:55.100 --> 04:57:57.900]   I think who's kind of coming around the corner here.
[04:57:57.900 --> 04:57:59.860]   So let me just do a quick overview.
[04:57:59.860 --> 04:58:01.460]   I'm gonna shoot myself in the foot
[04:58:01.460 --> 04:58:03.180]   for getting some cool people here
[04:58:03.180 --> 04:58:04.380]   and some exciting companies,
[04:58:04.380 --> 04:58:05.860]   but Relativity is one that,
[04:58:05.860 --> 04:58:08.340]   if you, you should definitely get Tim Ellis on the show,
[04:58:08.340 --> 04:58:10.960]   who is the CEO of Relativity.
[04:58:10.960 --> 04:58:13.100]   They're doing 3D printed rockets.
[04:58:13.100 --> 04:58:15.580]   They're the ones that have the world's largest 3D printer.
[04:58:15.580 --> 04:58:18.840]   They're getting really close to their first orbital launch.
[04:58:18.840 --> 04:58:19.700]   The cool thing about them,
[04:58:19.700 --> 04:58:21.540]   the reason that I think they're exciting,
[04:58:21.540 --> 04:58:24.420]   the reason that I think they have the potential
[04:58:24.420 --> 04:58:27.020]   is just how quickly they can iterate.
[04:58:27.020 --> 04:58:29.220]   I think 3D printing a rocket is really dumb.
[04:58:29.220 --> 04:58:33.360]   I think iterating with 3D printing on a rocket is brilliant
[04:58:33.360 --> 04:58:35.580]   because you can literally change software
[04:58:35.580 --> 04:58:38.020]   and have very little,
[04:58:38.020 --> 04:58:40.140]   upload a file and have a new rocket.
[04:58:40.140 --> 04:58:41.500]   That's amazing.
[04:58:41.500 --> 04:58:45.340]   So in terms of long-term iterative process,
[04:58:45.340 --> 04:58:47.740]   if we're really talking about hitting the ground running
[04:58:47.740 --> 04:58:50.660]   and just seeing where the evolution takes you,
[04:58:50.660 --> 04:58:52.940]   I think that's about as good as you can get.
[04:58:52.940 --> 04:58:54.460]   I think what SpaceX is doing at Starbase,
[04:58:54.460 --> 04:58:56.020]   just physically bending cheap steel
[04:58:56.020 --> 04:58:58.540]   is probably also a very valid solution.
[04:58:58.540 --> 04:59:01.420]   So I really think, and they have the engineering chops.
[04:59:01.420 --> 04:59:03.900]   I think they've got some amazing people there.
[04:59:03.900 --> 04:59:06.980]   Again, Rocket Lab, I adore what they work on.
[04:59:06.980 --> 04:59:10.120]   And like everyone, there's a caveat here
[04:59:10.120 --> 04:59:11.620]   that everything takes longer.
[04:59:11.620 --> 04:59:13.260]   Anything any company tells you,
[04:59:13.260 --> 04:59:15.460]   it's two or three times longer, just period.
[04:59:15.460 --> 04:59:17.340]   Rocket Lab's no different.
[04:59:17.340 --> 04:59:19.660]   But I really, they're working on a Neutron rocket
[04:59:19.660 --> 04:59:23.780]   that's gonna be like, I think 8,000 to 15,000 kilograms
[04:59:23.780 --> 04:59:24.620]   to lower Earth orbit.
[04:59:24.620 --> 04:59:26.340]   It's a good medium class rocket.
[04:59:26.340 --> 04:59:29.500]   Will compete right along with Falcon 9, hopefully.
[04:59:29.500 --> 04:59:31.740]   - By the way, Neutron would be its name, right?
[04:59:31.740 --> 04:59:33.220]   - Yep, so I like Neutron.
[04:59:33.220 --> 04:59:35.500]   - It's not some kind of fascinating new physics breakthrough
[04:59:35.500 --> 04:59:36.580]   where they're using neutrons.
[04:59:36.580 --> 04:59:38.140]   - No, no, but they are using,
[04:59:38.140 --> 04:59:41.500]   they're also using liquid methane and liquid oxygen.
[04:59:41.500 --> 04:59:44.640]   I just think it's a really, it seems like a great rocket.
[04:59:44.640 --> 04:59:46.900]   And assuming they can actually get it flying
[04:59:46.900 --> 04:59:49.180]   in two or three years, I think they're gonna be,
[04:59:49.180 --> 04:59:51.220]   it's here to stay, you know?
[04:59:51.220 --> 04:59:53.120]   I'd be remiss, right now I'm editing a video
[04:59:53.120 --> 04:59:54.680]   from an interview with Stoke Aerospace
[04:59:54.680 --> 04:59:56.280]   out in Kent, Washington.
[04:59:56.280 --> 04:59:58.620]   It was just one of these companies
[04:59:58.620 --> 05:00:00.400]   that they have a long ways to go.
[05:00:00.400 --> 05:00:02.320]   Like they're still in the very,
[05:00:02.320 --> 05:00:03.880]   they're behind the curve, frankly,
[05:00:03.880 --> 05:00:05.640]   in terms of launch vehicles right now.
[05:00:05.640 --> 05:00:07.540]   Because like I said, there's so many
[05:00:07.540 --> 05:00:08.640]   coming out of the woodwork.
[05:00:08.640 --> 05:00:11.120]   But the idea they're working on,
[05:00:11.120 --> 05:00:15.560]   their solution to a fully reusable rocket is amazing.
[05:00:15.560 --> 05:00:17.840]   One of the coolest concepts I've ever seen.
[05:00:17.840 --> 05:00:19.080]   - Are you gonna cover it in the video?
[05:00:19.080 --> 05:00:20.040]   - Yeah, yep, yep.
[05:00:20.040 --> 05:00:21.480]   That'll be hopefully coming out in the next,
[05:00:21.480 --> 05:00:24.120]   depending on what the schedule is down there.
[05:00:24.120 --> 05:00:26.080]   I'm actively editing that as we speak,
[05:00:26.080 --> 05:00:28.220]   and it is so cool.
[05:00:28.220 --> 05:00:31.400]   I mean, it is like, it's genius.
[05:00:31.400 --> 05:00:33.720]   And if they can actually get it to work,
[05:00:33.720 --> 05:00:34.720]   I can see them merging.
[05:00:34.720 --> 05:00:36.820]   I can for sure see someone potentially,
[05:00:36.820 --> 05:00:38.840]   like I perfectly, in a perfect world,
[05:00:38.840 --> 05:00:40.520]   they've merged with Rocket Lab.
[05:00:40.520 --> 05:00:43.040]   They, Stoke develops the upper stage,
[05:00:43.040 --> 05:00:44.960]   and maybe even the engines, they are.
[05:00:44.960 --> 05:00:48.000]   The two guys, the CEO, the co-founders of that company,
[05:00:48.000 --> 05:00:53.200]   they are engine, like propulsion engineer magnificence.
[05:00:53.200 --> 05:00:55.880]   They have, they used to, they both have worked at Blue.
[05:00:55.880 --> 05:00:57.400]   They developed engines in a hurry there,
[05:00:57.400 --> 05:00:59.240]   and then left Blue when it felt like
[05:00:59.240 --> 05:01:00.360]   it was getting too slow for them.
[05:01:00.360 --> 05:01:03.000]   And now they are, I mean, these guys fired
[05:01:03.000 --> 05:01:05.800]   a 15-chambered rocket engine,
[05:01:05.800 --> 05:01:07.360]   instead of four from the Soviet,
[05:01:07.360 --> 05:01:09.660]   we're talking 15 chambers, single turbo pump,
[05:01:09.660 --> 05:01:12.860]   70 times in the month of October.
[05:01:12.860 --> 05:01:14.180]   - Wow.
[05:01:14.180 --> 05:01:15.860]   - That's impressive. - Wow.
[05:01:15.860 --> 05:01:17.620]   - And that's like, that was on average,
[05:01:17.620 --> 05:01:20.420]   if you think about like days off, time off,
[05:01:20.420 --> 05:01:24.340]   parts changing, over twice a day on average
[05:01:24.340 --> 05:01:27.120]   of a Hydrolux engine, that's insane.
[05:01:27.120 --> 05:01:30.380]   So I love them, and I hope the best for them.
[05:01:30.380 --> 05:01:31.580]   (laughs)
[05:01:31.580 --> 05:01:32.940]   But they're also topical right now.
[05:01:32.940 --> 05:01:34.660]   They're at top of my head, so.
[05:01:34.660 --> 05:01:35.940]   - What about Firefly?
[05:01:35.940 --> 05:01:37.680]   - What I like about Firefly,
[05:01:37.680 --> 05:01:40.580]   they've already got kind of a traditional aerospace backing.
[05:01:40.580 --> 05:01:42.380]   They're starting to buddy up a lot with Northrop Grumman.
[05:01:42.380 --> 05:01:45.400]   So they're gonna be building the booster stage for Antares,
[05:01:45.400 --> 05:01:48.380]   which is currently flying only out of Wallops, Virginia,
[05:01:48.380 --> 05:01:50.480]   and is one of the only other commercial providers
[05:01:50.480 --> 05:01:51.500]   for the International Space Station.
[05:01:51.500 --> 05:01:53.900]   And Northrop Grumman is a very traditional
[05:01:53.900 --> 05:01:55.140]   aerospace company, you know,
[05:01:55.140 --> 05:01:57.240]   like lots of solid rocket boosters,
[05:01:57.240 --> 05:01:59.260]   and they've purchased, ironically,
[05:01:59.260 --> 05:02:02.980]   their current Antares is reliant on Russian engines
[05:02:02.980 --> 05:02:05.620]   and Ukrainian boosters, two things that I don't think
[05:02:05.620 --> 05:02:07.940]   you're gonna be able to get your hands on too much anymore.
[05:02:07.940 --> 05:02:12.940]   So they're looking to some US propulsion and stages.
[05:02:12.940 --> 05:02:16.660]   So they actually are partnering with Firefly,
[05:02:16.660 --> 05:02:20.060]   and their new Antares rocket will be a first stage
[05:02:20.060 --> 05:02:21.340]   built entirely by Firefly.
[05:02:21.340 --> 05:02:23.780]   So I'm excited that Firefly already has
[05:02:23.780 --> 05:02:25.900]   the propulsion technology.
[05:02:25.900 --> 05:02:27.900]   And they actually developed, ironically,
[05:02:27.900 --> 05:02:30.220]   their tap-off cycle engine was developed
[05:02:30.220 --> 05:02:33.000]   in partnership with Ukraine, with Ukrainian engineers,
[05:02:33.000 --> 05:02:36.260]   who developed the whole turbo pump system.
[05:02:36.260 --> 05:02:41.020]   So it's like, it's this cool meddling of these worlds.
[05:02:41.020 --> 05:02:44.700]   Their former CEO, Tom Rakusik, was,
[05:02:44.700 --> 05:02:45.740]   like I have an interview with him,
[05:02:45.740 --> 05:02:50.740]   and he's, anyone that can just spout nuances and facts,
[05:02:50.740 --> 05:02:51.620]   I just love.
[05:02:51.620 --> 05:02:54.580]   I just soaked that guy's information up as best I could,
[05:02:54.580 --> 05:02:56.260]   'cause he is brilliant.
[05:02:56.260 --> 05:02:58.780]   Literally a doctor, a rocket doctor, you know.
[05:02:59.780 --> 05:03:01.940]   So yeah, I mean, that's what, like you said,
[05:03:01.940 --> 05:03:04.420]   the fascinating thing about these folks, they're legit.
[05:03:04.420 --> 05:03:06.300]   They're such great engineers,
[05:03:06.300 --> 05:03:08.300]   the people that bring these rockets to life.
[05:03:08.300 --> 05:03:11.180]   And then there's all this stuff that we know
[05:03:11.180 --> 05:03:14.340]   and don't know about in China and other parts
[05:03:14.340 --> 05:03:16.620]   and other nations that are putting stuff into orbit.
[05:03:16.620 --> 05:03:18.500]   One of the sad things also is like,
[05:03:18.500 --> 05:03:21.460]   with Lockheed and Boeing is,
[05:03:21.460 --> 05:03:24.820]   it's just military applications in general.
[05:03:24.820 --> 05:03:28.980]   There's so much technology that's currently being developed
[05:03:28.980 --> 05:03:30.780]   that we probably know nothing about.
[05:03:30.780 --> 05:03:34.260]   And it makes me a little bit sad, of course.
[05:03:34.260 --> 05:03:37.180]   But for several reasons.
[05:03:37.180 --> 05:03:41.660]   One is that the use of that technology has really much,
[05:03:41.660 --> 05:03:46.060]   it's not that inspired, it's like a very military focus.
[05:03:46.060 --> 05:03:47.100]   - Yeah, it's to kill someone.
[05:03:47.100 --> 05:03:48.860]   - It's to kill someone, yeah.
[05:03:48.860 --> 05:03:53.020]   There's not even like a side application.
[05:03:53.020 --> 05:03:55.220]   And the big one is that the secret,
[05:03:55.220 --> 05:03:57.580]   it's shrouded in secrecy
[05:03:57.580 --> 05:03:59.700]   as opposed to being a source of inspiration.
[05:03:59.700 --> 05:04:00.620]   - Yeah, 100%.
[05:04:00.620 --> 05:04:02.620]   - But that's the way of the world.
[05:04:02.620 --> 05:04:04.660]   Like what was that one plane that you covered
[05:04:04.660 --> 05:04:06.820]   that was like we know nothing about?
[05:04:06.820 --> 05:04:08.060]   - Oh, the X-37B.
[05:04:08.060 --> 05:04:09.260]   - The X-37B.
[05:04:09.260 --> 05:04:11.780]   - Yeah, orbited for over 900 days and returned.
[05:04:11.780 --> 05:04:13.220]   Like, yeah, I wanna know about that thing.
[05:04:13.220 --> 05:04:14.180]   - What's that thing up to?
[05:04:14.180 --> 05:04:15.100]   - I don't know.
[05:04:15.100 --> 05:04:17.100]   That's what's, it's so frustrating.
[05:04:17.100 --> 05:04:19.900]   We know when it launches, people,
[05:04:19.900 --> 05:04:21.980]   amateurs track and know,
[05:04:21.980 --> 05:04:24.060]   they even will be like, oh, it changed orbit.
[05:04:24.060 --> 05:04:26.260]   It raised and lowered its orbit, blah, blah, blah.
[05:04:26.260 --> 05:04:28.420]   We generally have just almost no idea
[05:04:28.420 --> 05:04:29.540]   what it's doing up there.
[05:04:29.540 --> 05:04:32.780]   And it just saddens me 'cause I wanna know.
[05:04:32.780 --> 05:04:33.620]   And it's awesome.
[05:04:33.620 --> 05:04:35.380]   It's a great vehicle.
[05:04:35.380 --> 05:04:37.620]   - War, what is it good for?
[05:04:37.620 --> 05:04:41.820]   You mentioned Kerbal Space Program, the video game.
[05:04:41.820 --> 05:04:44.140]   Someone asked you what video game you recommend
[05:04:44.140 --> 05:04:45.660]   for learning about space and rockets,
[05:04:45.660 --> 05:04:49.700]   and you said, duh, Kerbal Space Program.
[05:04:49.700 --> 05:04:50.900]   So tell me about this game.
[05:04:50.900 --> 05:04:52.060]   What is this game?
[05:04:52.060 --> 05:04:56.180]   And I also saw, heard that a second one is coming out.
[05:04:56.180 --> 05:05:01.180]   So what, you know, I've been playing more games recently
[05:05:01.180 --> 05:05:05.980]   'cause games are fun and they remind you
[05:05:05.980 --> 05:05:07.180]   that life is awesome.
[05:05:07.180 --> 05:05:10.300]   So why should I play this game?
[05:05:10.300 --> 05:05:12.460]   - If you wanna learn about rockets,
[05:05:12.460 --> 05:05:14.900]   how to fly, how to build, how to get into orbit,
[05:05:14.900 --> 05:05:16.740]   how to get to other planets,
[05:05:16.740 --> 05:05:19.300]   there's no better way to learn about rockets
[05:05:19.300 --> 05:05:20.140]   than playing Kerbal Space Program.
[05:05:20.140 --> 05:05:21.380]   - So what does it entail?
[05:05:21.380 --> 05:05:22.940]   Like, do you actually like--
[05:05:22.940 --> 05:05:26.460]   - It's like SimCity and Microsoft Flight Simulator
[05:05:26.460 --> 05:05:27.460]   for rockets.
[05:05:27.460 --> 05:05:28.300]   - Oh, interesting.
[05:05:28.300 --> 05:05:31.220]   So you will get to like, what, do you design the rockets?
[05:05:31.220 --> 05:05:33.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[05:05:33.180 --> 05:05:37.140]   It's, okay, so I started playing it in like 2014, I think,
[05:05:37.140 --> 05:05:39.460]   around as I'm like falling in love with space.
[05:05:39.460 --> 05:05:41.940]   And I became obsessed with this game.
[05:05:41.940 --> 05:05:45.740]   Like literally you, you know, you take a,
[05:05:45.740 --> 05:05:47.860]   like you get, boop, a little command module.
[05:05:47.860 --> 05:05:49.140]   Click, you click on a fuel tank.
[05:05:49.140 --> 05:05:50.260]   Boop, you choose your engine.
[05:05:50.260 --> 05:05:51.700]   Boop, you choose a stage connector.
[05:05:51.700 --> 05:05:55.060]   Boop, you connect more tanks and build these space planes
[05:05:55.060 --> 05:05:56.460]   and fantastical things.
[05:05:56.460 --> 05:05:58.380]   And it's all like physics-based.
[05:05:58.380 --> 05:06:00.180]   And it's available, this sounds like a commercial.
[05:06:00.180 --> 05:06:03.140]   It's available on PC and Mac and console.
[05:06:03.140 --> 05:06:04.500]   Like it's available everywhere.
[05:06:04.500 --> 05:06:05.540]   - But wait, there's more.
[05:06:05.540 --> 05:06:06.460]   - But wait, there's more.
[05:06:06.460 --> 05:06:07.300]   And--
[05:06:07.300 --> 05:06:09.860]   - You said like you streamed yourself playing this.
[05:06:09.860 --> 05:06:11.260]   Are any of those videos up still?
[05:06:11.260 --> 05:06:12.100]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:06:12.100 --> 05:06:13.740]   There's some of my, actually the first videos
[05:06:13.740 --> 05:06:17.740]   I ever uploaded to YouTube were like recaptured streams
[05:06:17.740 --> 05:06:20.820]   from Twitch that I just physically uploaded to YouTube.
[05:06:20.820 --> 05:06:21.780]   - This is awesome.
[05:06:21.780 --> 05:06:23.620]   - And so it's me playing Kerbal.
[05:06:23.620 --> 05:06:26.620]   I used to do this kind of like a podcast style thing.
[05:06:26.620 --> 05:06:27.580]   I should get back into this
[05:06:27.580 --> 05:06:28.780]   'cause it's one of my favorite things I ever did.
[05:06:28.780 --> 05:06:31.220]   It's called, we called it Todayish in Spaceflight History,
[05:06:31.220 --> 05:06:33.780]   but these days I'd probably just play Kerbal.
[05:06:33.780 --> 05:06:35.860]   But I had my friend come sit next to me.
[05:06:35.860 --> 05:06:37.500]   His name's Jacob.
[05:06:37.500 --> 05:06:41.140]   And he is a former professional pole vaulter.
[05:06:41.140 --> 05:06:44.340]   Just this really, knows nothing about rockets.
[05:06:44.340 --> 05:06:45.180]   - Yes.
[05:06:45.180 --> 05:06:46.020]   - Knows nothing about space.
[05:06:46.020 --> 05:06:48.980]   Hilarious, like in the sweetest, most fun way.
[05:06:48.980 --> 05:06:51.100]   He, you know, as an adult asked me
[05:06:51.100 --> 05:06:52.980]   which is bigger, the Earth or the moon?
[05:06:52.980 --> 05:06:54.100]   And I love that for him.
[05:06:54.100 --> 05:06:55.660]   You know, that's fantastic.
[05:06:55.660 --> 05:06:57.220]   He's just a delightful human.
[05:06:57.220 --> 05:06:58.420]   He would sit next to me.
[05:06:58.420 --> 05:07:00.580]   We would recreate a historical spaceflight mission
[05:07:00.580 --> 05:07:01.620]   in Kerbal Space Program.
[05:07:01.620 --> 05:07:03.260]   And he would just sit there and play guitar
[05:07:03.260 --> 05:07:06.260]   and sing about what I'm like doing and asking questions.
[05:07:06.260 --> 05:07:08.300]   And it's still one of my favorite things I've ever done.
[05:07:08.300 --> 05:07:09.940]   - Yeah, you should definitely do something like that.
[05:07:09.940 --> 05:07:14.540]   So basically just, yeah, shoot the shit with a friend.
[05:07:14.540 --> 05:07:15.900]   - Get their curiosity going.
[05:07:15.900 --> 05:07:18.060]   Let them just sit there and ask questions.
[05:07:18.060 --> 05:07:18.900]   It was awesome.
[05:07:18.900 --> 05:07:21.700]   Like, I mean, yeah, those are some,
[05:07:21.700 --> 05:07:23.060]   I've done it a handful of times.
[05:07:23.060 --> 05:07:25.060]   I think we probably did like 20 or 30 episodes or something.
[05:07:25.060 --> 05:07:27.100]   And it's definitely something
[05:07:27.100 --> 05:07:28.340]   I would like to get back to doing.
[05:07:28.340 --> 05:07:31.460]   - Can you in the game, like go to the moon?
[05:07:31.460 --> 05:07:33.660]   - Yeah, so it's technically a different solar system.
[05:07:33.660 --> 05:07:37.420]   It's the Kerbal system and you're on the planet Kerbin.
[05:07:37.420 --> 05:07:39.860]   So there's the Mun, M-U-N.
[05:07:39.860 --> 05:07:43.940]   There's a second moon in this system on this planet.
[05:07:43.940 --> 05:07:45.180]   It's called Minmus.
[05:07:45.180 --> 05:07:47.340]   - They didn't want to pay licensing fees or what?
[05:07:47.340 --> 05:07:48.780]   (laughing)
[05:07:48.780 --> 05:07:49.940]   - Well, it's just a little easier.
[05:07:49.940 --> 05:07:51.100]   It's a little bit smaller.
[05:07:51.100 --> 05:07:53.220]   So the physics are easier.
[05:07:53.220 --> 05:07:55.220]   - Oh, so it tries to be consistent with physics.
[05:07:55.220 --> 05:07:56.060]   - Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
[05:07:56.060 --> 05:07:58.980]   The physics are all like real world physics.
[05:07:58.980 --> 05:08:00.540]   And I mean, there's aero simulations.
[05:08:00.540 --> 05:08:03.540]   There's all of it's like one-to-one,
[05:08:03.540 --> 05:08:05.060]   for earth physics. - That's awesome.
[05:08:05.060 --> 05:08:07.500]   - It's just on an easier scale, solar system.
[05:08:07.500 --> 05:08:09.580]   So it's easier to navigate.
[05:08:09.580 --> 05:08:11.380]   But there's still like, there's a planet called Eve
[05:08:11.380 --> 05:08:13.060]   that's kind of like Venus.
[05:08:13.060 --> 05:08:14.700]   So it has a really thick atmosphere,
[05:08:14.700 --> 05:08:16.460]   really thick, really soupy.
[05:08:16.460 --> 05:08:18.620]   It's in a lot more gravity.
[05:08:18.620 --> 05:08:21.500]   So it's just really, really hard to get off of.
[05:08:21.500 --> 05:08:23.420]   It's relatively easy to land on Eve,
[05:08:23.420 --> 05:08:25.540]   but like that's kind of like the ultimate boss in the game
[05:08:25.540 --> 05:08:26.700]   is like getting off of Eve.
[05:08:26.700 --> 05:08:28.540]   So that's one of my favorite things to do
[05:08:28.540 --> 05:08:32.580]   is build these crafts to get to Eve and try to return home.
[05:08:32.580 --> 05:08:34.700]   - You mentioned that there's almost like a podcast thing.
[05:08:34.700 --> 05:08:37.180]   You also did our Ludicrous Future.
[05:08:37.180 --> 05:08:40.820]   Is there a podcast in your future?
[05:08:40.820 --> 05:08:42.900]   Are you thinking, do you enjoy the medium?
[05:08:42.900 --> 05:08:45.420]   You're so incredibly good at talking.
[05:08:45.420 --> 05:08:50.420]   It's less effort to sort of to produce.
[05:08:50.420 --> 05:08:53.460]   Is that something in the back of your mind also?
[05:08:53.460 --> 05:08:57.180]   - Oh man, I love talking.
[05:08:57.180 --> 05:08:58.660]   - Yeah, and you're very good at it.
[05:08:58.660 --> 05:08:59.500]   I mean, yeah.
[05:08:59.500 --> 05:09:05.180]   - I find that I, it's just, the problem with,
[05:09:05.180 --> 05:09:07.700]   for me with podcasts, and I think it's the podcasts
[05:09:07.700 --> 05:09:10.420]   that I've done, have tried to be relatively topical
[05:09:10.420 --> 05:09:13.380]   about like the current spaceflight affairs.
[05:09:13.380 --> 05:09:15.580]   And four, three or four years ago,
[05:09:15.580 --> 05:09:19.780]   that was actually manageable for me to keep up with.
[05:09:19.780 --> 05:09:22.180]   These days, man, I can't keep,
[05:09:22.180 --> 05:09:24.300]   I just can't keep up with it.
[05:09:24.300 --> 05:09:26.220]   I gave up on trying to be super topical.
[05:09:26.220 --> 05:09:29.460]   And I realized that maybe my biggest talent
[05:09:29.460 --> 05:09:31.620]   and the things that resonate most with people
[05:09:31.620 --> 05:09:36.500]   is just trying to explain the basics and the root.
[05:09:36.500 --> 05:09:38.220]   So I'm really just trying to like,
[05:09:38.220 --> 05:09:41.860]   I'm trying to do less live streams if I can,
[05:09:41.860 --> 05:09:44.060]   but then again, like "Star Trek," I gotta stream that.
[05:09:44.060 --> 05:09:45.660]   There's no way I'm not gonna do that.
[05:09:45.660 --> 05:09:46.820]   But I'm really just trying to get back
[05:09:46.820 --> 05:09:48.940]   to like making the deep dive videos
[05:09:48.940 --> 05:09:52.100]   where I have no limit on how long and how deep
[05:09:52.100 --> 05:09:53.420]   and just really go for it,
[05:09:53.420 --> 05:09:54.740]   'cause that's actually what I love to do the best.
[05:09:54.740 --> 05:09:58.020]   - Yeah, I mean, that's like views aside,
[05:09:58.020 --> 05:09:59.460]   those are just works of genius
[05:09:59.460 --> 05:10:00.940]   and you're getting better and better at them.
[05:10:00.940 --> 05:10:02.700]   And like, that's the,
[05:10:02.700 --> 05:10:06.580]   that in terms of the beautiful things
[05:10:06.580 --> 05:10:08.340]   you can create in this world, those are that.
[05:10:08.340 --> 05:10:09.620]   So like, if you continue,
[05:10:09.620 --> 05:10:13.180]   especially where the way space travel is developing,
[05:10:13.180 --> 05:10:15.260]   like that, your voice is very much needed.
[05:10:15.260 --> 05:10:20.260]   So I think it's wise to do what you do best.
[05:10:20.260 --> 05:10:22.740]   - And I think I'm feeling more and more,
[05:10:22.740 --> 05:10:23.620]   especially this last year,
[05:10:23.620 --> 05:10:25.980]   I did a lot of like live streaming and traveling
[05:10:25.980 --> 05:10:28.100]   back and forth between Florida and California
[05:10:28.100 --> 05:10:32.540]   and here and just handling major, like big live streams,
[05:10:32.540 --> 05:10:33.900]   really stressed myself out.
[05:10:33.900 --> 05:10:35.100]   And at the end of the day, I was like,
[05:10:35.100 --> 05:10:38.100]   all of this is taking away from my ability to make videos.
[05:10:38.100 --> 05:10:40.220]   And that's ideally, honestly,
[05:10:40.220 --> 05:10:41.940]   if I like had my choice of things,
[05:10:41.940 --> 05:10:43.860]   I would just ignore everything else
[05:10:43.860 --> 05:10:47.980]   and just sit and lock myself in my house for a year
[05:10:47.980 --> 05:10:49.380]   and just sit there and make videos
[05:10:49.380 --> 05:10:52.660]   and go and travel every other month, you know, for fun,
[05:10:52.660 --> 05:10:54.500]   like not for space stuff,
[05:10:54.500 --> 05:10:58.140]   just go and do some light traveling, you know, some--
[05:10:58.140 --> 05:11:00.540]   - Like around the moon or what?
[05:11:00.540 --> 05:11:02.240]   - Yeah, just some light traveling.
[05:11:02.240 --> 05:11:07.300]   - What advice would you give to young folks
[05:11:07.300 --> 05:11:10.820]   or just folks struggling to find their way in life,
[05:11:10.820 --> 05:11:13.540]   whether they're in high school, college, or beyond,
[05:11:13.540 --> 05:11:15.660]   like how to have a life they can be proud of,
[05:11:15.660 --> 05:11:17.540]   how to have a career they can be proud of?
[05:11:17.540 --> 05:11:20.080]   You've had a really interesting journey yourself.
[05:11:20.080 --> 05:11:25.720]   What from that can you draw, give advice to others?
[05:11:25.720 --> 05:11:29.980]   - To be honest, like I feel like it's so painfully obvious
[05:11:29.980 --> 05:11:32.860]   to follow your heart and follow like what makes you happy
[05:11:32.860 --> 05:11:36.420]   that I'm just shocked that people allow themselves
[05:11:36.420 --> 05:11:38.100]   to sit on like mediocrity, you know,
[05:11:38.100 --> 05:11:39.020]   like to just sit there and be like,
[05:11:39.020 --> 05:11:40.260]   well, this is just what I do.
[05:11:40.260 --> 05:11:42.820]   You know, and for a lot of people, that's perfectly fine.
[05:11:42.820 --> 05:11:44.820]   Like I have, you know, some of my best friends
[05:11:44.820 --> 05:11:47.260]   are clocking in and out and they're perfectly happy.
[05:11:47.260 --> 05:11:48.180]   They have a wonderful life.
[05:11:48.180 --> 05:11:50.180]   Absolutely no judgment there, of course.
[05:11:50.180 --> 05:11:55.220]   But for people that are stuck feeling like they're not sure
[05:11:55.220 --> 05:11:56.780]   of, you know, what's next
[05:11:56.780 --> 05:11:59.620]   and how to bring light into their world,
[05:11:59.620 --> 05:12:00.880]   you really just gotta listen to like
[05:12:00.880 --> 05:12:02.260]   what does make you happy.
[05:12:02.260 --> 05:12:03.580]   You know, people feel guilty about,
[05:12:03.580 --> 05:12:05.660]   oh, I play video games for eight hours.
[05:12:05.660 --> 05:12:08.020]   Then start learning how to make a video game.
[05:12:08.020 --> 05:12:10.320]   Learn how to do reviews of video games or make,
[05:12:10.320 --> 05:12:12.900]   there's so many, you can work in the video game industry.
[05:12:12.900 --> 05:12:15.020]   You know, you don't have to isolate your love
[05:12:15.020 --> 05:12:18.660]   from your work, you know, and it's just funny that we,
[05:12:18.660 --> 05:12:22.980]   you know, maybe you feel guilty that you drink too much.
[05:12:22.980 --> 05:12:25.340]   Okay, I don't know if this is a good advice.
[05:12:25.340 --> 05:12:28.260]   Go learn how to make alcohol, you know, be a--
[05:12:28.260 --> 05:12:29.100]   - Start a liquor company.
[05:12:29.100 --> 05:12:29.940]   - Yeah, start a liquor company.
[05:12:29.940 --> 05:12:31.460]   I mean, maybe that's a careful advice.
[05:12:31.460 --> 05:12:34.780]   - No, it's great advice, but it's also in your own story,
[05:12:34.780 --> 05:12:37.060]   it seems like you've almost stumbled on,
[05:12:37.060 --> 05:12:40.060]   like some of it is just exploration
[05:12:40.060 --> 05:12:42.660]   and keeping your mind and heart open
[05:12:42.660 --> 05:12:45.180]   to discovering that thing that grabs you, right?
[05:12:45.180 --> 05:12:46.020]   It's not--
[05:12:46.020 --> 05:12:47.180]   - What do you fall asleep thinking about?
[05:12:47.180 --> 05:12:48.020]   You know, like--
[05:12:48.020 --> 05:12:51.300]   - But you stumbled on the space almost accidentally, right?
[05:12:51.300 --> 05:12:52.140]   I mean--
[05:12:52.140 --> 05:12:53.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:12:53.060 --> 05:12:55.380]   - I get, would you, when you were doing,
[05:12:55.380 --> 05:12:58.060]   being a professional photographer, would you have known?
[05:12:58.060 --> 05:12:59.100]   - Oh, no.
[05:12:59.100 --> 05:13:00.580]   Well, do you wanna know what I wanted to be
[05:13:00.580 --> 05:13:01.420]   when I was a kid?
[05:13:01.420 --> 05:13:02.240]   - What's that?
[05:13:02.240 --> 05:13:04.020]   - Well, first, when I was young, I wanted to be a tractor.
[05:13:04.020 --> 05:13:07.140]   I'm not quite sure I understood how that works.
[05:13:07.140 --> 05:13:09.500]   Then I wanted to be a scorpion trainer.
[05:13:09.500 --> 05:13:11.500]   Thought I could train 'em to cut people's lawns.
[05:13:11.500 --> 05:13:12.340]   - Better and better.
[05:13:12.340 --> 05:13:13.180]   - Yep, yep.
[05:13:13.180 --> 05:13:15.620]   And then, honestly, the majority of my childhood--
[05:13:15.620 --> 05:13:16.660]   - Cut people's lawns, got it.
[05:13:16.660 --> 05:13:18.340]   I think your understanding of physics early on
[05:13:18.340 --> 05:13:20.060]   was just a little--
[05:13:20.060 --> 05:13:21.660]   - The pincers, man, the pincers.
[05:13:21.660 --> 05:13:26.820]   Then from like probably six until like early college,
[05:13:26.820 --> 05:13:29.220]   I wanted to be a prosthetic engineer.
[05:13:29.220 --> 05:13:34.220]   And never once did I think about anything rockets, really.
[05:13:34.220 --> 05:13:37.260]   I had like a space shuttle poster.
[05:13:37.260 --> 05:13:39.340]   I had some space shuttle Legos.
[05:13:39.340 --> 05:13:42.620]   I liked space and I knew of the space shuttle,
[05:13:42.620 --> 05:13:45.500]   but it was far down the list
[05:13:45.500 --> 05:13:47.620]   as far as things that I thought were cool.
[05:13:47.620 --> 05:13:51.900]   Ninja Turtles, Lamborghini Countach,
[05:13:51.900 --> 05:13:54.140]   B-17G Flying Fortress.
[05:13:54.140 --> 05:13:55.820]   Yeah, I guess that means--
[05:13:55.820 --> 05:13:57.700]   - If you just keep your heart open
[05:13:57.700 --> 05:14:00.540]   to falling in love with an idea, with a passion, yeah.
[05:14:00.540 --> 05:14:02.300]   You could start from that,
[05:14:02.300 --> 05:14:05.260]   from Ninja Turtles and scorpions cutting lawns
[05:14:05.260 --> 05:14:10.260]   to being one of the best, one of the top educators,
[05:14:10.260 --> 05:14:13.540]   inspirational figures in space,
[05:14:13.540 --> 05:14:16.060]   and actually traveling around the moon.
[05:14:16.060 --> 05:14:18.580]   And who knows, maybe one day stepping foot on the moon
[05:14:18.580 --> 05:14:21.240]   and Mars, even though you say you're not interested.
[05:14:21.240 --> 05:14:24.140]   It seems like you stating that you're not interested
[05:14:24.140 --> 05:14:27.620]   in certain things somehow results in you--
[05:14:27.620 --> 05:14:29.180]   - And you're doing those things.
[05:14:29.180 --> 05:14:31.140]   - My friends joke that I'm gonna be the first person
[05:14:31.140 --> 05:14:32.500]   to go to the moon against their will.
[05:14:32.500 --> 05:14:34.980]   - Yeah, like, all right, all right.
[05:14:34.980 --> 05:14:35.820]   - Dang it.
[05:14:35.820 --> 05:14:37.540]   - This is, all right, what's the food like up there?
[05:14:37.540 --> 05:14:38.540]   - Guys, we're gonna start a fundraiser.
[05:14:38.540 --> 05:14:42.060]   Please, Tim just doesn't wanna go.
[05:14:42.060 --> 05:14:43.940]   - Definitely don't want to do it.
[05:14:43.940 --> 05:14:45.780]   All right, Tim, you're an incredible person.
[05:14:45.780 --> 05:14:47.060]   Thank you so much for everything you do.
[05:14:47.060 --> 05:14:49.420]   I've been a fan of yours for a long time.
[05:14:49.420 --> 05:14:52.100]   Not just the content, but just who you are as a human being,
[05:14:52.100 --> 05:14:54.300]   just how excited you are for everything.
[05:14:54.300 --> 05:14:56.660]   It's just an inspiration, you're a joy to watch.
[05:14:56.660 --> 05:14:57.900]   Thank you for being you.
[05:14:57.900 --> 05:15:00.500]   Thank you for doing the stuff you're doing.
[05:15:00.500 --> 05:15:03.100]   I can't wait to see what you do next, man.
[05:15:03.100 --> 05:15:04.860]   Thank you so much for talking with me today.
[05:15:04.860 --> 05:15:05.700]   That was awesome.
[05:15:05.700 --> 05:15:08.020]   - Thank you so much, it's my pleasure.
[05:15:08.020 --> 05:15:10.700]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tim Dodd.
[05:15:10.700 --> 05:15:12.020]   To support this podcast,
[05:15:12.020 --> 05:15:14.820]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[05:15:14.820 --> 05:15:18.700]   And now, let me leave you with some words from H.G. Wells.
[05:15:18.700 --> 05:15:21.980]   Life, forever dying to be born afresh,
[05:15:21.980 --> 05:15:24.080]   forever young and eager,
[05:15:24.080 --> 05:15:26.020]   will presently stand upon this earth
[05:15:26.020 --> 05:15:27.740]   as upon a footstool,
[05:15:27.740 --> 05:15:31.420]   and stretch out its realm amidst the stars.
[05:15:31.420 --> 05:15:35.580]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[05:15:35.580 --> 05:15:38.160]   (upbeat music)
[05:15:38.160 --> 05:15:40.740]   (upbeat music)
