[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He's mocked on a fairly regular basis by some financial professionals for his hourly-fee model
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and the model's obvious inability to make him rich.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   [Laughter]

[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   [Laughter]
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   His goal is never to be confused with Jim Framer.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Please welcome Alan Law. [Applause]
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   In 1998, our final panelist created the Coffeehouse Investor in an effort to bring a simpler and smarter investment philosophy
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   to individuals and corporations across the nation and around the world.

[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Like Rick, he eventually saw the light and came over from the dark side.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   [Laughter]

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Please welcome another one of the good guys, my friend, author Bill Schultheiser.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   [Applause]
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   All right, gang, we're going to start out with the questions, and if one person answers
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   and somebody else has got something to add, please don't consider the question answered just because one person chimed in.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So if you've got something to say, we'd like everybody to contribute.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The first question, and it pays to be the recording secretary because you get your questions moved right to the top.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   The question's from Victoria.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It says, "A question for the panel about the order of distributions in early retirement.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   The investor has some sums in the traditional IRA and taxable accounts.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   The investor's goals are as follows.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Wait to collect Social Security at the age of 70, complete the alumnate traditional IRA by the age of 70 when the RMDs would have started,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   and limit annual traditional IRA withdrawals to stay within the 25% tax bracket.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And the investor has some flexibility in the order of drawing money from the traditional IRA and taxable accounts.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   One extreme, withdrawal"--are we all together on this?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Victoria, you really are working me out here.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   "One extreme, withdraw or convert from the traditional IRA in the beginning of the retirement
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and live off the taxable accounts the remaining time to age 70."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So that's one scenario.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   "The other extreme, delay the traditional IRA withdrawals and conversions for as long as possible."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Now the questions.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Which is preferable?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And what are the main considerations when deciding between the two options?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   What was the second option?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   The first option--
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I got the first option. What's the second option?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   The second option is the other extreme is delay the traditional IRA withdrawals and conversions for as long as possible.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I'll take it.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I've always said investing is simple.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I've never said taxes are.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   The answer is clearly it depends.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And it's probably not an either extreme.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You don't want to get rid of your entire traditional IRA, even under the RMD, if you can take it out of the 0% tax bracket.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   So you want to take out enough of your traditional IRA that you stay either in the 0% or very low tax bracket.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You don't ever want to let some of your--be below zero.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Even if you don't need the money, do a broad conversion with the difference.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So the answer really is it depends, and it's probably not an either extreme.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Now we're going to have the real CPA, the expert here.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   That was a good answer.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I think, in the first place, it's a good idea to prioritize traditional IRA distributions prior to age 70 if you're holding off on Social Security until age 70.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Because what typically happens, or often happens, once you start receiving Social Security benefits,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   is that your marginal tax rate ends up being higher than the actual tax bracket you're in.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Because there's this range.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Boba Hett's guy in the retirement plan even called it the "tax hump."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I thought that was a pretty good term.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Where each additional dollar of income doesn't only cause--so for instance, if you're in the 15% tax bracket,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   each additional dollar of income doesn't only cause 15 cents of income tax.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It also causes either 50 cents or 85 cents of Social Security benefits to become taxable.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Even if you're in the 15% income tax bracket, once you're receiving Social Security, your marginal tax rate can actually be 22% or 27%.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Sometimes it can be advantageous to go ahead and prioritize traditional IRA distributions prior to receiving Social Security.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   That's something that Victoria already posited in her question, which is a good idea.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So I'm not answering her question, I'm just emphasizing part of it as a good idea.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   In terms of actually which of those two extremes I think Alan is right, it's going to depend.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And neither extreme is probably the right answer.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I think Vanguard touched on it last night, too, that you want to diversify your future tax obligations.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   We never know what is going to happen.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   For instance, if you converted everything to the Roth and they put a value-added tax or a national sales tax, you're going to get hit again.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So you may want to consider having some in each to diversify the possible unknown future tax situation.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   All right, we'll move on to the next question. It's from Lisa Prius.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Morningstar recently published a paper entitled Pay and Switch, Glad Path Instability.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Among other things, it shows how the glad slopes of several companies' target funds have changed.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Key world prices have been consistent but aggressive.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Vanguard's made a huge change in 2006.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Fidelity has literally been all over the map.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I'd like to hear your comments on glad path instability and the legitimacy of the target date fund approach.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I can tackle that because the question references a Morningstar paper.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And it is something that our team keeps a close eye on, and that's why they only recommend pretty skinny-down group of target date series.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Vanguard's is among the ones that we consider the best.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   We also do like the T-Row plan. It is generally more aggressive than most others.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   American Funds and J.P. Morgan's also receive top ratings.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   But certainly the stability of the glad path figures into our assessment.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   We're also looking at a lot of other factors as well, such as costs and quality of underlying options,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   when we decide whether or not to recommend these products.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   But I do think that target date funds, there's a huge disparity, and we have seen, frankly, some performance chasing going on among the target date providers.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   One notable change that we saw among a lot of the plans in the wake of the bear market was to make, generally, the glad path more conservative,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   at what, in hindsight, is obviously an inopportune time to have done so.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   So I think this should definitely be part of anyone's analysis if they are considering using a target date product.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   We normally recommend the people ignore the, in getting to the legitimacy, the second part, the legitimacy of the target date fund approach.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And I am a big fan of the target date approach with some qualifications.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   One is you need to look under the hood and ignore the date and look for the fund that has your desired asset allocation.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And one of the reasons I really like them is because it gives you a nicely diversified portfolio in a single holding.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And it's hard to go wrong with that, a fund that rebalances daily.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   So it has a lot of advantages, and it's a hands-off approach, and I think it's ideal for the default option on the 401(k).
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   The only problem is, is that everybody that's the same age is probably going to get stuck in the same fund, which is not the best approach.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But you could do a lot worse than a target date fund.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I'm just going to put out a point of clarification because you might hear these terms out there when they're discussing target date funds,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and the two terms are, is it a "to fund" or "through fund."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   A "to fund" means on the day that you, that target date, the amount of money that's in your fund should be,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   the money that's in your fund should be at all cash.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   So the allocation will go from some point in equity all the way down to the target date,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   and it will be 100% in cash on the target date.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   That's a "to fund."
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Then there's a "through fund."
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And I think what Morningstar has done is given you an index of the "through funds," which say you're going to a target date for retirement,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and on that target date you're going to have an allocation to equity still.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It might be 30%, it might be 40%, it might be 20%,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   but you're going to go through that date.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   So just so you have heard these terms before, there are target date "to funds" and target date "through funds."
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Well, a while back I wrote a column for Morningstar, and it was titled "Fixing Target Date Funds,"
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and one of the recommendations I made in that is when you're going to look at a target date,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I thought that it might be helpful to have a 2050 moderate, conservative, and aggressive,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   which might help the young people select something that identifies them.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And even though they all have the same target date on it,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   they would have different allocations based on being aggressive, being moderate, or being conservative.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And I would like to see that adopted in the industry,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   but I don't think that it's necessarily as complicated as it sounds.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   You wouldn't necessarily end up with three particular funds for each year,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   because the aggressive for one year might be the same as the moderate in another year.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So actually, they would be in the same fund, the same fund, and I'd like to see that.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I think that would be helpful for young people when they come out,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   because some people are conservative, some people want to be aggressive,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and I think that would help them make a better selection.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I would just like to make an additional comment on target date funds.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I saw by the show of hands yesterday afternoon that very few people here actually have target date funds.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Most of you choose to manage your own underlying pieces, and that's fine.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   But I am passionate about this idea of benchmarking yourself to see how well you're doing.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So I suggest for most investors creating a simple custom benchmark that mirrors your own asset allocation
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and consists of the most vanilla index funds that you can find.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So that's one benchmark.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   But a second simple benchmark that I think you should hold yourself to is to look at whether you are doing as well
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   as a target date fund geared to someone in your general age band and set of situations.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   So I think that that's just a good way to see whether you are adding or subtracting value,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and maybe you have something completely different going on so the target date fund isn't relevant to you.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   But I think for a lot of people it will help them be honest with themselves about how well their security selection,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   how much it's contributing to the bottom line.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Two of the key features that the average investor would have to work on that they don't have to do with target date funds
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   are both the automatic rebalancing and the getting more conservative as they age.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Those are two things that investors have to do on their own if they have individual funds,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   but they don't have to do that with the target date funds.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Can I say one?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Sure.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   You know, managers of target date funds are people too,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   and I would say that if you can't be right on the asset allocation, be consistent.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And as much as I love target date funds, which harness the power of inertia,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I generally don't recommend them because the asset location for tax efficiency can be done by buying the individual funds.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Yes?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Just a question.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Vanguard brought up that the target date funds rebalance daily.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You just mentioned that's an advantage of target date funds.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   This may be a stupid question because I haven't researched the answer, but I know Dr. Bernstein can probably explain it.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   If the market took a 50 percent correction in 2008,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   wouldn't a target date fund, by rebalancing daily, take a greater than 50 percent correction?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The problem is that when you're running a large institutional fund, you don't have a whole lot of choice but to rebalance daily.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   David Swenson made a virtue out of that in his book.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It's not a virtue.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Being able to rebalance intermittently for the individual is a superior strategy for the obvious reason that, you know,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   you want to give the market a little bit of time to run both on the upside and downside before you pull the trigger.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   That had obvious advantages in 2008-2009 as well as on the way back and as well as on the way up for that.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Yeah, there are a number of studies.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   In fact, I read a lot of Morning Story a few years back, and I think 18 months was the ideal time for rebalancing.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   The problem is you can argue about whether you should do it on your birthday every year or whatever,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   but the problem is a lot of people don't rebalance, and the target date funds do that for them.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   If you're a religious, do your rebalancing and so forth.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   The more you want to manage your portfolio, that's fine, but what we're talking about is kids coming out of college,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   getting their first job, and now HR hands them a packet that's got 40 funds listed, and they don't have a clue of what to do.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   So they put 2.5% in every fund, or if there's 10 funds in there, they put 10% in each of the 10,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   and four or five of them are large growth funds or whatever.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   So the target date funds, I think, are a great starting point for young investors.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Alan correctly mentioned that the fund location is incorrect, but for a lot of investors, their 401(k) is their only investment.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   So in that case, there is no location problem because they don't have a taxable account.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   But if they have taxable and non-taxable, then the point is well taken that you want to put your equities in your taxable account
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   and new bonds in your tax deferred accounts, which implies that you're not using the target date funds.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Well, I mean, my point really was the overall risk of a target date fund in a situation like 2008.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   The equity portion is not going to have – you know, use a simple example of the market drops 1% 50 trading days in a row,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and they rebalance each day as such as an approximation.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   The equity portion of the portfolio is going to take a 20% greater drawdown than if you don't rebalance every day.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Because you're rebalancing and buying the equity portion almost continuously.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   1% every day, you're taking a greater drawdown.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's putting more risk in the portfolio, the equity portion.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It's not as bad as all that because you're not rebalancing every single day within the fund.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   You're simply rebalancing within flows and outflows so that when the market is rapidly moving up or down,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   as it did before, during, and after the crisis, they're certainly not rebalancing back to policy every day.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   It probably took them several months to catch up at the end.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   So it's not quite as bad as doing it in a rebalancing community every day, which would be a disaster.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   I know the next question is controversial, so we'll get to that.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's a question from J.V. Clark '02.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Do you recommend including Social Security and/or a defined benefit plan indexed to inflation as part of one's bond allocation?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And if so, how do you compute their value?
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   This is my favorite question. That's absolutely every damn year.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   [laughter]
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And the answer is you can either do it one of two ways, but you can't double count.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Let's say you're someone who needs $70,000 a year to live on, and you're getting $30,000 in Social Security,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   so you have a residual need of $40,000 a year.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   You can either say that I'm going to annuitize or capitalize my Social Security.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   It's worth $300,000, $500,000, $200,000, whatever, but I have to spend $70,000 a year out of my portfolio.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So in other words, you capitalize it into your bond, but then you fully own all of your living expenses as a liability.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   So that's method A. Method B is to say, "Ah, I only need $40,000 a year to live on."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Then you sure as heck cannot capitalize your Social Security and pensions as a bond allocation,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   because if you say that the third alternative is the incorrect thing, which a lot of people love to do is they say,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   "Ah, I'm going to capitalize my Social Security. I now have a $300,000 bond in my portfolio,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and I only need $40,000 a year to live on." Nah, can't do that.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So you do one or the other.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Well, I think that that's a little change in your position, I think, from previous years,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   or at least my understanding, because I thought you were saying, "Do it."
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   No, no, no, no. You do one or you do one or the other.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   But Jack is a big fan of doing it, of capitalizing it,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and one of the downsides to capitalizing on that is that you end up with a huge bond allocation
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   based on your Social Security, so you end up with a much larger equity position
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   because you're counting your Social Security as bonds.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And when you work 50/50 and Social Security is arbitrarily, we'll say, 30%,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   you've got 20% bonds and you've got 80% equity in the rest of your portfolio,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   and at a time when you're retired, because we're talking about Social Security,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I think you end up with way, way too much risk for the average investor.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Mel, I'm not sure if I mentioned this last year, if we did talk about this,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   but I was speaking with Harold Davinsky, the financial planner,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   about this very issue during the 2008 downturn,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   and he is against using Social Security as part of the bond allocation,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and he said that it simply doesn't work from a behavioral standpoint,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   for the reason you mentioned, that you would say to clients during a market environment like that,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "Oh, your bond position is doing just fine," and the client would say,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   "What bond position? I have only stocks and I'm down 35%."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   He said that it just doesn't fly with clients,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and the risk level of the equity portfolio is just too much for people to stand on.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I wrote an article with Craig Israelson, who is from Brigham Young University,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   and I post it on the website all the time, and it's called "Is a Pension a Bond?"
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   It also gets into Social Security, and the simplest way of doing this is from a cash flow basis.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Bill, a couple of years ago, one of his choices is to do it from a cash flow basis,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   so I'm not going to use the word "capitalization," which is simply, as Bill said,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you have $70,000 a year of liabilities.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   That's what your spending is in retirement.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   You're getting $30,000 of that covered by Social Security.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Your liability from your savings is $40,000 a year.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Therefore, what asset allocation should you have that will give you $40,000 a year?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   That's the easiest way of doing it, so it's not part of your bond allocation.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It's simply covering some of your liabilities, and to look at your asset allocation overall,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   you just look at what is not being covered by Social Security or a pension.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I think that's just the simplest way of doing it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   The next question is about wide moats.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   It says, "Are wide moats the real deal, or are they the flavor of the month?"
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   As far as I'm concerned, they're the flavor of the month because I've been hearing about wide moats since--
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   What are moats?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Moats.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Explain.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Moats. Wide moats.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   These are companies that are considered to have wide--they call it wide moats
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   because they have the technology, they have the patents, and things like that
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   to protect them from competition.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Think of the old days when they had the moats to protect the castles.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   The castle is the company.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   The assessment of a company's moat or lack thereof is a big part of our analysis process for individual companies,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   and Mel shorthanded it exactly right.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   It's a company's sustainable competitive advantage.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   This is not a concept that is original to Morningstar.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's really a Warren Buffett concept, and the idea is that the company,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   with the sustainable competitive advantage, would enable you to own it for a longer period of time,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and it would have that ability to fend off competitors over time.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   We analyze our performance of the stock ratings, which do hinge both on valuation
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and whether a company has a moat,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and what we see in general is pretty good performance from that combination of characteristics,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   so both low valuation as well as whether the company has a moat.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   In general, the performance is better in down markets than it is in very buoyant up markets,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   so our moat rating won't look so good in a 2009-type environment
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   where a lot of companies that were just lucky to be alive did the best.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   The moat ratings did very, very well during the bear market
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   and have done fairly well over a full market cycle as long as we've been examining them.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   There are certainly other companies that do some assessment of the same general thing we're looking for,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   but that's the general performance characteristics--strong downside performance,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   less strong performance in rallies.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Are we talking about picking stocks?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   I guess.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I had to ask Alan to explain what it is.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's one way of doing it if you want to pick stocks.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   You know, if someone put a gun to my head and made me pick stocks,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   the criteria that I would use would be obvious qualitative indicators of corporate governance.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Does the CEO fly around in a corporate jet for personal reasons?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Has any highly placed person in that corporation bought a piece of real estate costing more than $10 million?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   If you look at those companies that have those characteristics,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   and there are a lot of them, they have market returns that are very, very much lower than the stock market.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   So that would be--I would never pick stocks, but if I had to pick stocks, I wouldn't pick wide goods.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I'd simply avoid the companies with morally decrepit managements.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   [laughter]
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   [applause]
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I think random selection is better than any flavor of the buzz.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Sorry, Christine.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Okay, the next question is for Bill Bernstein.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It says, "In your recent article in Money Magazine,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   "you said to have your retirement expenses covered by tips, short-term bonds, and other duties.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   "Would you consider Vanguard's short-term investment-grade bond funds
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "to be a good substitute for individual short-term bonds?"
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   If you don't mind taking, you know, a 10% capital haircut during the next crisis, then sure.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Yeah, I think pretty much covers it.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Let me get the cards out.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   These are questions that were just--I might have a little more time reading them because of the handwriting,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   but these were turned in just recently by the people who are here.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   So if I call your name, please stand up just so we can acknowledge you.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Paul Stratton. Paul asks, "With all the investors hunting for yield,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   "please discuss how bad non-exchange-traded REITs and similar investments are."
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   So how bad are non-exchange-traded REITs and similar investments?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Wow, that's a good question.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   I've heard a lot of bad things about non-exchange-traded REITs lately.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   There's been a lot of fraud, and so is that baked into the price?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   I guess that would be my question.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   You can't package these things together and sell them as an index
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   once you have liquidity concerns as well.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So while you're getting paid for taking hold of this risk out there of fraud, this risk of liquidity,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   your yield on these things would have to be very high, I think,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   to make up for those risks to even consider it.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And then, of course, if you do, you would only consider it for a very, very small portion of your portfolio.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Okay, the next question is from Lady Inc. for Bill Schultheiss.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   We weren't done with that.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Just real quickly, I just drafted an article, "Investments from Hell and Non-Traded REITs" in there.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Non-traded REITs have lost a lot of money during the same period
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   that the Vanguard REIT index fund is up 100-and-some-odd percent.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Non-traded REITs are great for brokers selling them, not so good for the consumer buying them.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Yeah, I subscribe to a periodical called "Investment News,"
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   which is written for investment professionals.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   The reason why I do it is because they're very good at spotting a new, new thing.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   A year or two ago, there were a lot of articles about non-traded REITs.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   They were usually accompanied by a picture of a guy in a very expensive suit and no neck.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And I subscribe to that magazine just for that reason,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   because it's a really good way of spotting early the next investment scandal.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   They interviewed me for that magazine just last week.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   In the same rag in "Investment News," there's been a lot of press over the last couple of months
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   on how these non-traded REITs have had to be revaluated or repriced, and they've just gotten hammered.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   I think the question is, again, how much do you put in your portfolio, which is probably not very much.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And so is that potential added yield really worth the potential risk of the portfolio?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   You're not knowing what's going on in your portfolio with that part that you have allocated to those non-traded REITs.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Okay, next question is for Bill Schulteis from Lady Geek.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He says, "Your eloquently worded post about what the requirements are for managing other people's money
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   is an inspiration for those who wish to become financial advisors.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   While this forum has a generally negative attitude towards financial advisors,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   it's mainly due to the cost of portfolio management.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Please expand on the roles that financial advisors play other than portfolio management."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Well, you know, a couple things that are interesting.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Number one, just in chatting with so many of all of you over the last two or three days
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and the response from that post on the forum, it's amazing the number of you who have considered
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   and who want to help people.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Now, you can do that in your spare time, or you can, like some of us, get compensated for it.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   But the need is phenomenal.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I look at Rick. Rick, can you stand up over there?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You know, the stuff that Rick is doing, and he actually happens to be in my neck of the woods, is phenomenal.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Where's Chad? Chad, would you stand up?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   You know, so many of you folks are saying, "Hey, you know, I want to take this bogal head type
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   passive philosophy and help people."
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And there is an enormous opportunity to help people.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   People are screaming for help.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Last night we were talking to some of the folks at Vanguard.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   The amount of energy that Vanguard is putting in to helping advisors help investors is off the charts.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   I mean, they're really seeing not only helping advisors, but setting up their own systems.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   And their own projects to help investors.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   It's just an enormous opportunity.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And I think that the benefits of embracing a passive philosophy with clients and people that you want to help is
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   there's a multitude of benefits.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Number one, you know you're going to capture the asset class's returns.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   So performance never becomes an issue.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   When we sit down with clients, we never talk about performance.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Like, "Oh, should we be in this fund or that fund?"
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   That's a non-issue.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   What we're talking about are the financial planning issues that matter most of all.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And I have to commend you, Sue, and the other folks who have put together that great, great resource on the
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   bogal head side.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And also I think that you talked about the Canadian side.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Norton, would you stand up back there?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   The amount of effort that you've put forth in helping people work through the financial planning process.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Because that's where -- you know, it's so interesting, the fees on -- what Vanguard is doing.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   You know, the fees on the investments are just, you know, contracting to zero.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   And what they're doing is they're spending this time on addressing the financial planning and the investment
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   help for people.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   So that's where the real value is, is in helping people.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And so, you know, again, I would encourage all of you who are considering taking this and helping people to
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   continue to pursue that.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Because there's never been a time in our country where people are looking for help more than they are today.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   It's just -- it's a wonderful, wonderful opportunity.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And I'm sure that a lot of other of you have something to add on that.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Well, I think that in following along with this, where each individual can make a difference,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   is the lady from Phoenix, Arizona here.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   There she is in the back.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Now, there's an individual who is working with a group of high-powered women in the Phoenix area who make a
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   lot of money but don't have a clue.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   And she's working with a group to educate them.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   So everybody can take a step like Rick did on his own and like she did on her own to help people who are
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   looking for help or who need help.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   So each individual can make a difference, even if you're only helping one or two people.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   It's making an impact.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Have you got a follow-up?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Yeah, I got the follow-up, if that's what you're talking about.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Yeah, the follow-up, what financial planning is about.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   So the follow-up is also your insight on how most people view investing and is enlightening.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   How should a logo head convey our investing approach to a person who not only has no idea what we're talking
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   about but is intimidated by the difficulty of managing investments?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Is that the follow-up you were talking about?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Also about the concept of investing as part of the bigger financial planning, estate planning, taxes,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   that type of thing.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   They need guidance.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Investing is part of a financial plan, and they don't -- we're focused on investing, not the bigger picture,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   which I think is more important.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Well, you know, one of the things that's been so impressive, John Vogel said it here yesterday,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   and they articulated it again at the Vanguard presentation last night, is the importance of keeping the
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   investment process simple so that you can, in fact, focus on all those issues that you bring up, Sue.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   You know, it's so interesting.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   My favorite story is last fall some folks came into our office, you know, a couple of 55 years old,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   they're both professionals, and they're both -- you know, and the husband says, "Well, what do you think of
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   what's going on in Greece?"
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   And he said, "Well, you know, should we have some gold in our portfolio?"
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And after two hours of chatting with them, they're leaving, and the wife says to the husband,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   "You know, we've really got to figure out how much we're saving."
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And so, you know, two weeks ago somebody asked me a question like, "What do I think of Europe?"
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And really for me as a 52-year-old investor, as an investor, I couldn't care less what's going on in Europe.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   It's totally irrelevant to me what the stock market does over the next two years.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   What's important is how much my wife and I are saving, and are we saving enough so that the glide path
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   through retirement allows us to meet our financial obligations, and that's what people need clarity in.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I mean, you're alluding to something which is a much bigger problem than the investment process,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   which is the entire consumerist ethos of this country.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   I mean, the people inside this room are people who generally read wallpaper clips.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   But that's -- that's not -- that's not what people outside of this room are doing,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   and, you know, it's good luck with changing that.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   I would just want to comment on investment management is one slice of the entire big picture.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   The question is how do you get advice on the entire big picture, and how do you pay for it?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And there's lots of different theories about once you do your estate planning, once you do your financial plan,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   once you do your tax planning, first, how do you pay for that?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   And secondly, if it all leads up to hiring somebody else to actually manage your money, manage your portfolio,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   how do you pay for that?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   So it's -- I believe in the unbundling approach to this, where if you need estate planning, you pay for estate planning.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   If you need financial planning, you pay for financial planning.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Other people believe in a bundled approach where you pay one higher fee annually for everything,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   and I think you have to decide how often you're going to use those other products and how you have to pay for it.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   I'm under the belief that it should be unbundled, and you pay, and you go for the other stuff,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and the actual ongoing investment management, you pay an asset management group, and that's why I'm here.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   My belief is actually opposite of that.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   I feel that bundling really makes the most sense.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I've never been able to figure out how you can create a financial plan without taking all those different aspects into consideration,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   how much risk you need to take and are likely to take.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I mean, there's so many factors that go into that, and it just -- it's -- you know, I just can't see how you go down the street to a financial planner.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Does the financial planner make decisions on how much risk you're going to take and how you allocate your portfolio?
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   And if the financial planner says, okay, you're going to have a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   then does the financial planner articulate that to the investment advisor or does the client articulate that to the investment advisor?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   And when stock market crashes and the person needs to have their hands held, do they call the financial planner or do they call the financial advisor?
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   I just think that this is all so intertwined.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I mean, for some people who are able to do it, my hat is off to them, but I think it's a very integral process.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   I guess I would fall somewhere in between, Rick and Bill, in that I think it really depends on the individual and what they have going on in their lives.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Certainly for people with more complicated situations, small businesses, for example, or something else like that,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   then maybe the more holistic approach might make sense.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   But I have really gotten to be in favor of the hourly model for a lot of investors like you,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   who might need help with a more surgical type of problem where you have a specific question,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   such as the first question about the tax planning issues related to taking retirement distributions.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   That seems like a great place to check in with a tax advisor.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   You don't need to be consulting with that tax advisor on a regular basis, but just to get some guidance on how to proceed,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   to me that seems like a great way to go.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   So I come down with sort of splitting the difference.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   It really depends on who you are and what your needs are.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Thank you, Christine.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I changed my view on why it's better if there were more.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Well, I think Christine brings up a great point, that for a lot of people who have a good handle on the investing process
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and don't need the wisdom of the full gamut of financial planning,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   hiring someone on an hourly basis makes a ton of sense.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   The reality is that from the Boglehead's perspective, I think that the Boglehead crew is very, very unique.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Very, very few investors have the capacity to know how to piecemeal it out effectively.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I think it depends a lot on the size of your portfolio.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   The bigger my portfolio, the less interested I would be in paying an assets under management fee for estate planning or tax planning advice.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   As a second point, I just want to say thanks for that question,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   because I think on the forum we tend to get lost in really small, small, obscure details about portfolios.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   I just think it's great to pay attention to talk about other topics that just don't quite get as much coverage,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   tax planning, retirement planning, blended claims, social security, things like that.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   How much of your portfolio do you annuitize?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   I do think the need to take risk, you can't assess that.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Willingness to take risk you can do on a survey profile and it's very inaccurate because it changes over time.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Understanding the need to take risk is very important.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   One of the ahas I've had in the last 10 years is that people who come to me very pessimistic about running out of money have saved a bundle.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Those that are very optimistic haven't saved much.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   When you think about it, it's those that were worried about it, a little pessimistic,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   that actually deferred spending, lived below their means, and those that were optimistic about it spent every penny they had.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   The next question is regarding the Bogo Head philosophy as listed here.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   There are 10 items on the list.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   First, to develop a workable plan.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Two, is invest early and often.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Three, is never bear too little or too much risk.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Four, is diversify.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Five, is never try to time the market.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Six, use index funds when possible.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Seven, keep costs low.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Eight, minimize taxes.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Nine, invest with simplicity.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   And 10, stay the course.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And it says if there's anything you would add, if you could, to that philosophy.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And I would say number one has to be you live below your means.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   All the rest of the stuff is totally irrelevant if you don't learn to live below your means.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   So I think that the number one item that needs to be added to that list is live below your means.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Can I change one of the things on the list?
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Sure.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   As the author of the all about index funds and probably a prolific reader and analyst about index and index investing,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   I would scratch that one about index funds, to use index funds when possible.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   There are some index funds out there that are in asset classes I wouldn't use.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   For instance, municipal bonds.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   There aren't any good municipal bond index funds, really.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   There's an ETF out there, MUB, which is okay.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   But it has one-third the number of bonds in it as the Vanguard Intermediate-Tier Municipal Bond Fund,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   which is actively managed.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And the fee is more than twice the Vanguard Intermediate-Tier Municipal Bond Fund,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   which is actively managed.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   So even though it is possible to use a municipal bond index fund, I wouldn't use it.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Same thing with high-yield corporate bonds.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   I don't want to use an index fund of high-yield corporate bonds.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   I would rather use the Vanguard high-yield corporate bonds fund, which is no longer open to investors.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   But there's the TIA CREB Institutional Fund, which is pretty good that we're using.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   So "when possible" is not the best word.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Maybe you can just change the word.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   "When feasible" or "when something," but not just "when possible."
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   How about just use low-cost funds whenever possible?
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Low cost, I think, is key, yes.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Okay.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Are you getting this?
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   It looks like you're taking notes, Sue, because these are things that we have on the weekly,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   and we want to take those comments into consideration.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   People who use DFA funds, they are not index funds.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Like I said last night, they're quantitative, classically managed funds, but they don't follow an index.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   I mean, Bill, what index do DFA funds follow?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   DFA indexes.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Whatever their computers spit out is what they follow.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Jack's made that point several times.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   There's nothing magic about indexing.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   In fact, indexing does have certain disadvantages,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   particularly if you're trying to match and rebalance against a great, big, popular index.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   That's actually a disadvantage.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   I mean, for those of you out there who want a large-cap index fund,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   don't use the index fund.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Try, you know, the 500 fund.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Use the large-cap index fund that will pretty reliably,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   at least over the two or three-year horizon, outperform DFI index simply because it doesn't have good balance.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   I would recommend changing minimized taxes to maximize after-tax return.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   I tell my clients if they want to minimize taxes, give all their money away and quit their jobs.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   That's one of the reasons why people don't pay off their mortgage.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I'd lose the tax deduction, but it's the inverse of a bond.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   It's the opposite of a bond.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   You pay taxes on your total bond fund, which is yielding 1.7%.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You've got a 3.5% mortgage.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   You end up paying more taxes, but more importantly, you have a greater after-tax return.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Okay, the next question is from Hank Theory.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Is that the proper way to pronounce your name?
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   He says, "Most, if not all, of the conditions that led to the 2008 meltdown are still in place.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   When will the next meltdown occur?"
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   [Laughter]
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   In your opinion.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Yes.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   The next meltdown to occur is in China.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   That's my opinion.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   It will occur because the Chinese financial institutions are hiding bad assets.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   It's getting worse.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Yeah, the wonderful talk we saw on the last hour had a very nice graph, that pulse graph.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   And if you look at the right side of the graph, you saw that that pulse was wildly oscillating up and down.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   We have an unstable financial system.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   And the answer to your question is maybe tomorrow, maybe in 10 years.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   But financial history tells us that these things occur about once a decade.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And I think that our system, the instability in our system, where we can say that nothing's been fixed,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   probably tells us sooner rather than later.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   I think from a portfolio perspective, looking back at 2008, it was not fun.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   It was a nasty environment.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   But also I look at the Boglehead philosophy and also Jack Bogle's simple wisdom of having your age in bonds.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Now I know a lot of people are critical of that simple wisdom.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   But to me, that really proved its mettle in 2008.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   We had people who were retired and had only 30 to 35 percent of their portfolio in the market.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   You know, it wasn't a total disaster.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Yeah, their portfolio was down 7 to 10 percent.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   But it wasn't as if they lost 50 percent of their money.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Robert Shiller, I had the wonderful opportunity to listen to him shortly after the market crash.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   He said it was just this huge lack of understanding of this simple concept of asset allocation.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And so I think it's important that all of us, instead of trying to look at what's going to happen around the globe,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   admit that we're going to have bear markets every couple of years.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   I mean, it might be a 20 percent drop. It might be a 35 percent drop.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   But it is going to happen. It's a part of life.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   And to, you know, allocate your assets accordingly.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Okay, here's a question from Theresa.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   What do you see evolving in terms of the municipal debt problems and municipal bankruptcies and impact on related investments?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Well, let's look at the expected rates of return that states are looking at in order to balance their budgets, I guess, going forward on their retirement portfolios.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   And I think the average is 7.5 percent annualized.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Now, if we check the yield on the total bond market index fund yesterday, it was about 1.5.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   And let's say a state has half their money in fixed income, it might be a little bit conservative,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   but 40 percent of fixed income, that's yielding 1.5.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   What do you need to get on the other side of the portfolio to get to 7.5?
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   It's an enormous rate of return.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Now, the stock market, in my opinion, maybe we're going to get 7 percent rate of return,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   unless there's tremendous multiple expansion and VEs go back up to 30.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   But let's say that VEs just stay around 15, maybe a 7 percent return on equities going forward.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   So where does the money come from?
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Well, it comes from alternative investments, correct?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   All the alternative investments are going to compound at 30 percent compounded annual rate of return for every single state in the country.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Do you believe it?
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   I don't either.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   So there's a problem.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I mean, for political purposes, the rates of return on pension funds are about 2.5 percent, too high.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   And once you actually factor in what the actual rate of return will likely be on these pension funds,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   then every single state, almost every state out there, is in deep, deep, deep financial trouble.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Yeah, whenever you see the widespread adoption of a particular style of investing, holding on to your wallet tight,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   what we're seeing, and Rick wrote about this in Forbes several weeks ago,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   and what we're seeing also with the largest pension plans, Rick wrote about it in University Endowments,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   is that everybody is adopting the Yale model, which basically says put half of your allocation into alternative assets,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   pension funds, private real estate, private equity, commodities.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Whenever you have so much cash chasing so little opportunity, the potential for disaster is enormous.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Just simply, Rick has talked about one dimension of it just now, which is the arithmetic doesn't compute.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   If you have one and a half percent bonds returns, you have to get, I don't know, 11, 12, 13 percent stock returns.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   But that's not the real ticking time bomb.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   The real ticking time bomb is all the crap that people are chasing in all of their portfolios these days.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   One comment I would add specifically on munis is that I think you really do have to look at the credit quality of the portfolio
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   that you're investing in, and also fees go hand in hand with credit quality.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   So that's one reason I personally invest in Vanguard's muni bond funds,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   because the credit quality is generally higher than the peer group,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   in part because the low costs help the funds look competitive on a yield basis,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   so they don't have to venture into junky portfolios.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   I thought there was an interesting report that came out a few months ago.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   It was issued by a government agency that looked at the default rate among municipalities over the past decade or so.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   And a lot of people cite that data and say, well, muni default rates have really been quite low over time.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   This report looked at, once you added non-rated municipal bonds into the mix,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   actually the default rate was much higher, I can't remember what the specific number was,
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   but it was much higher than had previously been discussed.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   So I think you do have to be careful and generally try to keep the credit quality of any muni portfolio high.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   If you're owning a junkier, high-yield muni portfolio,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   then maybe you want to limit that to the margins of the portfolio.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   >> Christine, even if you're just considering the very highest quality municipal bonds,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   and you're looking at the historical rate, I question the validity of those historical data
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   because we're living now in an era with entitlement and pension obligations that we've never had to live with before.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   Do you think that those previous data are as relevant as we might like to think they are?
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   >> I'm just wondering what the answer is.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   There are many more defaults out there than what the media is calling a default.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   If you're a pensioner and you're getting a pension from the state of Rhode Island,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   and the state says, we're cutting your pension, isn't that a default?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   It's a default. It's just not a default on the bond.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   It's a default against an obligation. That's what a default is.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   There's going to be a lot of defaults out there.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   The federal government will default.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   It may not default on their treasury bonds, but they're going to default on some other obligations.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   Call it Medicare, call it Social Security, I don't care what you call it, it's going to be defaults.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   It's just not going to be called a default, but that's what it is.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   >> It might be that the pension plans have been kicking the can down the road for a long time,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   and we're getting to the end of the road.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   They were saved, of course, by the rural stock market, which really helped them out.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   But basically, a lot of these obligations are coming due because as America ages,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   more and more people are retiring, and the obligations are coming due where they have to pay out.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   So I think there's probably a -- as Rick alluded to, or as Bill alluded to,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   I think there's going to be a lot more of the -- whether they're official or unofficial bankruptcies.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   That's my opinion, and that's worth a lot, but that's my opinion.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   >> Can I say one thing?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   I'm actually more pessimistic than Bill and Rick.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   There's about $2.3 trillion of unfunded pension and health care liabilities,
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   assuming an 8% or 7.5% or 8% return.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   And Jack Bogle showed a slide yesterday of the expected DV return of 4.6%.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   So the math doesn't add.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   Perhaps the U.S. government bills the municipalities out.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Perhaps they're able to renegotiate those defined benefits.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   But there is a ton of risk.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   I did talk to Jack Bogle about it yesterday, and he's worried as well
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   and thinks that it could be right, but he's less worried than I am.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   >> You'll be pleased to know that I still have my medical license,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   but I won't be able to administer ECT right after this.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   >> I have a quick question for the planners, though.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Does that mean that for clients who have taxable portfolios that would call for bonds,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   does that mean that you're bypassing munis?
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   >> I always hedge my bet that I'm not necessarily smarter than the market.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   The munis make up about 7% of U.S. debt.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   So I certainly would not do more than 10% or, at the very most, 14%.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   Because, again, if stocks don't do well, then the pension liabilities,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   the shortfalls are going to get larger and larger,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   and you want your fixed income to be the shock absorber with stocks.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   I don't know when we're going to have the next bubble, but we will,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   and you want your bonds to be backed by the U.S. government, in my opinion.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   >> Is that 7% or 10% of the bond portion of the portfolio?
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   >> Yes, of the bond portion of the portfolio.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   >> What would you say the alternative would be?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   Does it mean the tax is a total bond?
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   >> You're talking -- say that again. I'm sorry to hear the question.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   >> You're saying that if you limit the potential bond portion of the fixed income,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   then you're putting that tax on the child's portfolio,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   and you don't have any money to handle real estate.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   >> I have 70% of my own fixed income in CDs,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   and CDs that have easy early withdrawal penalties.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   So I just opened up a CD this week at a credit union paying 2.2%.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   It's five years, but it has a 120-day early withdrawal penalty,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   which is like a put to sell it at .73.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   So if you compare the 1.5, 1.6 total bond portfolio, I'm earning more.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   I'm 100% U.S. government backed, and the total bond has a 5.1-year duration,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   which means if interest rates go up by 1%, then it would go down by --
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   and that's not a prediction, by the way, it's just a possibility --
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   then the total bond fund would drop by 5.1%,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   whereas I could pay that early withdrawal penalty, get my money out,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   and reinvest it at a higher rate.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   It's a non-Vanguard solution, vividly.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   >> I'm just staying with the Vanguard intermediate-term municipal bond fund.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   It has thousands and thousands and thousands of securities in it.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Now, I used to manage, for many years, individual municipal bond ladders,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   where I would build a municipal bond ladder for each client based on the state that they live in.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   I don't do that anymore.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   I'm not nearly smart enough to do that anymore.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   I used to be smart enough. I'm not smart enough anymore.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   Now I just stick with the very, very, very broadly diversified Vanguard municipal bond funds,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   and I think we'll be okay.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   And they're actively managed.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   >> If you want to move away a small portion of your taxable bond allocation,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   you can get $10,000 in add-ons, which are tax-deferred.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   You can get $20,000 per couple.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   If you've got a trustee, you get another $10,000.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   You get $5,000 back on your tax return.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   So you can get a smaller amount.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   In the good old days, you could get $30,000 per person, and those days would drop,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   but you could still get $20,000 per couple, which adds to your tax deferral.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   And they're currently yielding 2.2, even though the fixed rate is zero.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   So they're yielding 2.2%.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   I think the next rate has just been calculated at 1.76.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   So you'll get 2.2 for the first six months.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   You'll get 1.76 for the second six months.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   So that takes you out to the year.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   You can redeem them if something else more attractive becomes available.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   In addition to that, they're very flexible.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   If inflation raises and it's over the head and your rate goes up, you can hang on to them.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   You can use it for tax-shipping, moving it from your current high tax rate into the future
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   when you retire and get a lower tax rate.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   So it also is free from state and local taxes.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   So if you live in a state like New York, New Jersey, California with high state taxes, you can avoid those.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   So there's a lot of benefits.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   It's just a shame you can't invest more than $10,000 per person.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   But that's one option.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   At this time, we're going to take a break, and we'll resume with the Q&A after we take a break.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
