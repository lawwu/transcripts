[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   This evening we come, you remember, to a consideration of the parenthesis which is to be found in
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   the middle of the fifth argument which is used by the Apostle in the second chapter
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.140]   of his epistle to the Romans concerning this great matter of the wrath of God and justification
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.600]   by faith only. Now, we looked at the fifth argument in general last Friday night as it
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   stated in verses 11, 12, and 16, "For there is no respect of persons with God. For as
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.400]   many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without law, and as many as have
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.960]   sinned in the law shall be judged by the law in the day when God shall judge the secrets
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.400]   of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel." Now, we tonight are looking at these words
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.080]   which are to be found within brackets in this authorized version, the parenthesis in verses
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:09.520]   13, 14, and 15. "For not the sharers of the law are just before God, but the doers of
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.280]   the law shall be justified. For when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.840]   contained in the law, these having not the law are alone to themselves, which show the
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.520]   work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.800]   thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another." Now, in this parenthesis, the
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.840]   apostle does two things. He partly elaborates what he's been saying in his general statement,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.760]   and also at the same time deals with certain objections which he knew many were bringing
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.800]   against this particular argument of his, both amongst the Jews and also amongst the Gentiles.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.920]   So that we regard that as the object of the parenthesis, to make the thing abundantly
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.720]   clear and to anticipate and to deal with these possible objections. Now the best way, I think,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.400]   of looking at this important statement, it is a very important one from the standpoint
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.280]   of doctrine as we shall see, I think the best way of dealing with it is first of all, just
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.640]   again to note exactly what the precise terms of his statement are, and then look at the
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.400]   whole question of the doctrine. Now, with regard to the exact statement, verse
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.760]   13 deals with the whole case of the Jews, who thought that the very fact that they had
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.800]   heard the law, that they had the law, somehow or another put them right, and that they were
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   in a special category and compartment, that they need have no fear about the wrath of
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.800]   God, they already being God's people and his favourites, and in this peculiar relationship
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.600]   to him, and that therefore they need pay no attention to this preaching concerning Jesus
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   of Nazareth as the only way of righteousness in the presence of God.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.160]   Now that's what he deals with in verse 13, and he just tells them quite simply that it
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.400]   is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but the doers of the law shall
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.160]   be justified. The mere fact that a man has heard it is of no value to him at all. What
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.360]   the law demands is execution. Now, we ought to be all familiar with this particular point,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.000]   and therefore we needn't stay with it. We know, do we not, that ignorance of the law
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.440]   in this country is no plea, it's no excuse. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. But, you
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.160]   know, it's equally true to say that a knowledge of the law in and of itself is of no value
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.320]   either. It doesn't help a man who may be arrested for crossing the traffic lights when
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.040]   they're red to say that he knew very well that he shouldn't have done that. The question
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.600]   is that he did it. The mere fact that you know the law or are familiar with the law
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.400]   will not avail you at all if you've not kept the law. Now, that's what the apostle
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.240]   is saying in verse 13. It isn't people who hear it. You see, he says "hearers". We
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.040]   might today put "readers of the law". In those days, the people didn't read so much.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.720]   They sat and listened, and the law was expounded to them by their teachers. So, he talks about
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.120]   "hearers of the law", and that includes anybody who in any way is familiar with the
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.000]   statements of the law and the details of the law. And here is his principle. It isn't
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.080]   the hearers who are justified, but the doers. Those who do the law are the ones who shall
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:16.160]   be justified in the presence of God. Then, verses 14 and 15 deal with the Gentiles. You
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.040]   see, he takes up both parties. Jews first, then Gentiles. He's been saying twice over
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.240]   in verses 9 and 10, you remember, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile. Well, here
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   it is, he takes the Jew in verse 13, Gentiles in verses 14 and 15. And obviously, what he's
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.080]   dealing with is this. Somebody might very well have said "alright, I understand that
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.720]   about the Jew, but then what about the Gentile? Is it fair that the Gentiles who've never
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.000]   heard the law should be condemned? Is it right that a man should be condemned by a law that
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.520]   he's never heard of? Is it right that he should be condemned at all, therefore? If
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.680]   this is purely a question of law, and we admit that, as you put it, the Jews have no excuse
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.480]   and no case, and are under condemnation by the law, well then doesn't that mean that
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.800]   the Gentiles are free?" Now then, that's what he deals with in these two verses. And
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.680]   he says that they are not innocent. That the fact that the Gentiles have never received
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.920]   the law that was given through Moses, in the way that the Jews have done, that doesn't
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.240]   mean that they're free, and that therefore they're under no condemnation, and that
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.280]   they're all automatically justified before God. No, he says, why not? Well, these are
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   his answers. He says in verse 14 that these men, these Gentiles, which have not the law,
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.600]   are a law unto themselves. Now what does he mean by that? Well, what he means by that
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.080]   is this, that whereas it is perfectly right to say that they have never heard the law
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.800]   that was given by Moses, and are in no sense therefore under the law, they nevertheless
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.400]   have a moral consciousness. And it is because they have this moral consciousness that they
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.040]   are responsible, and therefore they can be judged in terms of that moral consciousness
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.800]   which they have. In that sense, they are a law unto themselves. In other words, they
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.960]   don't come under the law of Moses, but they come under this—you mustn't call it the
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   law—but this kind of other law, which is in terms of their moral consciousness, which
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.440]   leads to a sense of responsibility. Very well, says Solomon, that's a dogmatic statement,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.920]   but can that be proved? Is it absolutely certain that this is the truth about the Gentiles?
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.840]   Oh yes, says Paul. There are three proofs that inherit which establish this thing beyond
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:07.040]   any doubt whatsoever. The first is this, that they show the work of the law written in their
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:15.000]   hearts. Now, here is a very interesting statement, which we must look at rather carefully. You
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.360]   notice that the apostle does not say that they show the law written in their hearts.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:30.080]   He says they show the work of the law written in their hearts. Now, why did he vary the
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.040]   expression? Well, it's very important that he should have varied the expression, because
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.640]   he is not teaching here, as I shall be showing you in a moment when we come to the doctrine,
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.440]   he is not saying that the Gentiles, all people by nature, have the law of God written on
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.600]   their hearts. That isn't what he's saying. What he is saying is that they show that the
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:59.920]   work of the law, in other words, the things that the law is designed to produce, are written
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.080]   in their hearts. Now, a law is meant to produce certain results, isn't it? The law says, "Thou
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.280]   shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal," and so on, "Thou shalt not commit murder," and
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.680]   he tells you on the other hand that there are certain things that you should do. Now
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.120]   then, what the apostle is saying is this, not that the Gentiles have the law itself
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.080]   written on their hearts, but they show very clearly that these things about which the
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:35.880]   law is concerned are written on the hearts of these people. What he means is this, you
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:43.720]   see. He's already said it in verse 14, "The Gentiles which have not the law do by nature
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   the things contained in the law." In other words, you go and look at any pagan races,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.480]   you go and look at, in this time, any Gentiles, and you would find that they refrained from
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:03.600]   certain things. The Gentiles, however ignorant they may be, they've got ideas about murder
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.640]   and about robbery and about theft and things like that, and sometimes you'll find that
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.480]   this kind of moral notion and moral sense is very highly developed amongst certain primitive
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.360]   pagan tribes. Now that's what he means by the works of the law. The law says, "You
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.480]   mustn't do this, you should do that." Now these men show quite plainly in their
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.040]   conduct that they know something about this, because they punish murder, and they punish
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.520]   robbery and theft, and they teach their children that they shouldn't steal and things like
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.680]   that. There are many other illustrations, I'm simply picking out some at random. But
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.040]   of course the apostle has already said this very plainly in the last verse of the first
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.560]   chapter, where, writing about the Gentiles, he says, "Who, knowing the judgment of God,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.360]   that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:03.280]   in them that do them." And so you will find that in many pagan tribes and primitive tribes,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:10.520]   they actually will punish adultery, for instance, by putting such a person to death. They know
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.760]   these things in that way, and yet though they know them, says the apostle, they don't
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.200]   carry out what they do know. They commit the sins, and they try to justify themselves as
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.400]   they do so. Very well then, there is the first argument. They show very plainly that the
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:38.200]   work of the law is written in their hearts. That is why they have these rules and regulations,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:46.280]   and that is why they try to attain to a certain moral standard and moral conception. But then
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.880]   he goes on to a second argument, and the second argument is that they prove this by their
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:01.560]   conscience, their conscience also bearing them witness, bearing witness to this.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:08.720]   Now what is the conscience? Well, the conscience is a kind of voice, a faculty if you like,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:16.120]   that we all have within us. It's in all human beings belonging to the human race. It's a
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:23.440]   sense, if you like, of right and wrong. It is that inward monitor that tells us that
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.640]   certain things are wrong and that we shouldn't do them. It is the same power that if we do
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:37.040]   that thing which is wrong, that condemns us for it. And whether we like it or not, it
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:43.480]   is there, and it expresses its opinion, and it condemns us.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.640]   Now, it isn't for me this evening to digress here and to go at any length into this whole
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:56.000]   question of the conscience. It is a very important one, and we should be clear in our understanding
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.320]   of what the Bible does teach about the conscience. But there it is in its essence. The conscience
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.480]   is something that is mainly negative. Its business is not so much to tell you what is
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.960]   right as to tell you what is wrong, and to condemn you when you do something that is
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.320]   wrong. Now, the conscience is not a perfect instrument
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:22.360]   by any means. A man's conscience can vary a good deal during his life. The apostle Paul
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.640]   himself tells us elsewhere that when he persecuted the church of Christ, he did it in all good
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.760]   conscience. Indeed, he says that he had lived until that moment in all good conscience.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.040]   He came to see that some things he thought were right were wrong, and so on. So that
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.720]   we mustn't regard the conscience as a perfect instrument, but nevertheless, we must always
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:53.160]   obey our conscience. A conscience can be feeble, it can be unenlightened, and you can educate
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:00.400]   it, you can teach it, you can train it. But, whatever state our conscience may be in, it
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:08.600]   is always our business to obey it. It is never right for us to do anything against the conscience.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.080]   You may say, "Oh yes, but your conscience is unenlightened. I don't mind. If my conscience
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.240]   is unenlightened, well, it is my business to subject myself to further teaching. But
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   at any given moment, I must never go against my conscience."
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.400]   Now, you'll find the apostle will make that abundantly clear in his teaching, for instance,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   about the weaker brother in the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapters 8, 9, and 10.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.840]   The conscience of the weaker brother is always to be respected, because he must obey his
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.360]   conscience, and you mustn't be a stumbling block to him. That doesn't say that his conscience
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.380]   is perfect. But for the time being, it is perfect for all of us. And even as Christians,
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:56.200]   we must never act against the conscience. Well, that's a bit of a digression after all,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.280]   because what the apostle is really saying is this, and this is the immediate use which
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.960]   he makes of the conscience, that it doesn't matter how primitive a race of people may
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:15.680]   be, how ignorant, how unintelligent, how unenlightened, they've all got a conscience. They all know
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.380]   what it is to be condemned by their consciences. They all know what it is to be in a state
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:26.920]   of remorse. There is in every single human being ever born into this world, this inward
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:34.560]   voice and monitor that expresses its judgments and pronounces its judgment. The conscience,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:42.440]   very well. There is then a second mighty proof of the fact that these Gentiles are responsible,
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.080]   that the mere fact that they didn't know the law of Moses does not mean that there is no
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.860]   standard whatsoever by which they can be judged. The conscience proves that there is a standard.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.520]   And that brings me to the third, the last argument, which is this. Their thoughts, the
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:08.640]   mind, are meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another. Now, the word "thoughts" isn't
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:16.880]   a very good translation here. What it really means is their reasonings. Let me give you
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:24.680]   an alternative translation. Their reasonings also between one another, accusing or else
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:32.640]   excusing one another. What he means is this. He says, "You know, don't you, that these
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:40.200]   Gentiles who have never heard the law of Moses, they often have arguments amongst one another
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.360]   as to whether a certain thing is right or whether it's wrong. Not only that," he says,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.960]   "they have disputes and debates and arguments amongst one another as to whether what a certain
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.640]   man has done is right or not. They condemn one another and then they try to excuse themselves
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.800]   and they wouldn't do all this unless they've got a standard." Now again, you see, this
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:06.760]   is universally true. Go to the most primitive types that you can find anywhere in the world
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.080]   and you'll find they're always doing this sort of thing. Now, was that right? Is that
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:17.320]   thing that that man did right or is it wrong? Accusing or excusing. And then you see a man
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.040]   will condemn a thing in another and defend it when he's done it himself. "Ah," he says,
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.680]   "it isn't, there's this explanation or there was this peculiar circumstance or factor."
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:33.760]   Your reasonings among one another, either accusing or else excusing. And the very fact
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.440]   that people do that is the final proof of the fact that they've got this moral sense,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:47.040]   this moral consciousness, this ability to differentiate between right and wrong and
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:55.000]   between good and evil. And so, you see, he establishes his case that the mere fact that
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.880]   the Gentiles were not aware of the law of Moses does not for a second mean that they
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:07.800]   cannot be judged. The Jew is judged as to whether he keeps the law of Moses or not.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   The Gentile is going to be judged according to his conformity to what he does know. This
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.600]   law unto himself, this moral consciousness, this moral idea that he's got, and his conformity
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:30.360]   to it. He takes the ground from beneath his own feet in that threefold manner. And therefore,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:37.600]   there is no difficulty at all about understanding and seeing how it comes to pass that the Gentile
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:45.280]   is as much subject to judgment as is the Jew. Now then, there is what I would call a straightforward
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:53.840]   bit of exposition. There we've got his terms, we've paraphrased what he said. Now then,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   having done that, we can come to the teaching. What is the doctrine here, then? Now this,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:07.400]   I say, is of tremendous importance because it's very frequently misunderstood. And here
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:14.240]   are some of the ways in which it is misunderstood. There are those who say on the basis of this
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:21.200]   parenthesis that the Apostle Paul teaches quite plainly that there were certain Jews
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   who did justify themselves by keeping the law. They said, look at verse 13, he says,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.640]   "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.560]   be justified." Surely, you must take the thing at its face value, you must take the
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.760]   words as they stand before you. And there, quite plainly, the Apostle is saying that
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.840]   the man who does keep the law is justified by that. And then that means that the Jews
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.640]   who do keep the law are justified by their keeping of the law. That's one. Another false
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.600]   argument which is developed is this. There are those who say that the Apostle is here
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:08.560]   teaching that there is a kind of natural law which is written in the hearts of all
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:19.360]   men. That the same law which God gave to the children of Israel through Moses was originally
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.960]   written in the hearts of all men, and remains in the heart of all pagans who've never
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.400]   heard of the Mosaic law at all. They say it's there quite plainly. Doesn't the Apostle
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:36.440]   say this? That they show the work of the law written in their hearts, and they do by nature
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:42.760]   the things contained in the law. That's the second false deduction which is drawn
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:51.960]   from this parenthesis. And then the third is this. That the Gentiles, people who've
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:21:02.200]   never heard the gospel, if you like, can save themselves and do save themselves by living
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.640]   up to the light that they have. Now you've often heard that argument, haven't you? What
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.840]   about the pagans, people who have never heard the gospel at all? Ah, the answer is given,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.800]   they're all right. You see, as long as they live up to the light they have, they're
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.280]   saved, they're all right. God wouldn't be unjust. All they've got to do is to live
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.280]   up to the light they have, and that puts them all right, though they've never heard
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.040]   the gospel. You've often heard that argument, and sometimes it's applied to the Greek
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.080]   philosophers who lived before our Lord ever came into this world, and it is said that
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.680]   because of their excellent moral teaching and so on, that those men were saved by that.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.160]   They'd never heard of the Mosaic law, they'd never heard the gospel, but they'd got
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.560]   this light and they lived up to it, and therefore that they are saved.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:54.320]   Now then, those are the three things that are said most frequently on the basis of the
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:03.880]   teaching of this parenthesis. So it seems to me that we've got to deal with them. And
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.840]   I take it that the best way in which we can do that is for me, first of all, therefore,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:15.280]   to emphasize what this parenthesis does not teach. Let's start with our negative. What
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:23.800]   doesn't it teach? Well, now, here are some of the answers. This parenthesis, like indeed
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   the whole of this section, does not deal with nor teach in any shape or form the way of
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   justification or salvation for anybody. It doesn't deal with the way in which the Jew
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:49.920]   is justified, nor the Gentile is justified. It doesn't raise the question of justification
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   or salvation at all. That isn't what he's dealing with. He's dealing with condemnation.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.280]   He's dealing with judgment. He's dealing with wrath. And he literally doesn't raise
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:10.360]   the question of the way of salvation here at all. That's one thing it doesn't teach.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:24.680]   It does not teach that anyone ever has or ever can keep the law and thereby be justified.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.320]   Now this, you see, is one of the three things which I've just been mentioning. So let
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:35.840]   me say this again. This parenthesis does not teach at all that anybody ever has or ever
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:45.680]   can keep the law and as the result of so doing be justified. How do I prove that statement?
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.840]   How can I establish that contention? Well, here are my arguments. The first is this.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:58.200]   It's an argument I've had to use several times already in connection with this chapter.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:11.760]   The whole object of the Apostle, from chapter 1 verse 18 to chapter 3 verse 20, is to prove
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.880]   that no flesh is justified in the presence of God. That's the purpose of the whole
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.040]   section of which this is a part. The Apostle here is setting out to prove that both the
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:33.000]   Jews and the Gentiles are all under condemnation. He will wind it up by saying that he can conclude
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.440]   therefore that by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight. He says
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.640]   it also in these words, "Every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be guilty
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:51.440]   before God. There is none righteous, no, not one. All have sinned and have come short of
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.200]   the glory of God." That's what he's setting out to prove. So if he suddenly says here
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.120]   halfway through that there are some Jews who have kept the law and therefore justified
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:07.400]   themselves, well he's just contradicting himself blankly and hopelessly and saying
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.080]   the exact opposite of that which he's setting out to demonstrate. However, we needn't
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.320]   rely on that. That's enough. The Apostle doesn't do things like that. He's a most
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:24.040]   logical thinker. He proceeds from step to step. He takes up objections and answers them.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.400]   And how vital it is therefore that as we're looking at any section we should bear the
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   whole in mind. That's one argument, but I've got others. Look at verse 13. What does verse
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:44.360]   13 say? Well, verse 13 is not telling us anything about what anybody does. It's simply telling
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:51.520]   us what the law demands. "For not the hearers of the law just before God." What the law
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:58.160]   demands is not has a man heard it or not. What the law asks is, has he kept it? Has
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.320]   he done it? Has he put it into practice? That's what the Apostle's talking about. He isn't
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.840]   saying that there are certain people who've done this or that. He's saying, look here,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.000]   to say that the mere fact that you've heard the law puts you right in and of itself is
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.320]   to show that you're ignorant about what the law really says and what it demands. It doesn't
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:23.040]   call for a mere hearing, a mere acquaintance with itself. What it demands is that it should
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.760]   be put into practice. That is what the law demands. Now that's what the Apostle is talking
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.440]   about. He isn't saying that the Jew or anybody else can ever come up to these demands. All
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.920]   he's saying is this, that for people to say that really nothing matters except that the
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.560]   Jew can say, "Ah, after all the law was given to us." He says that doesn't help you at all
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:52.040]   because that very law says, "Have you kept my injunctions? Have you carried out my dictates?"
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:59.400]   Now let me make this perfectly plain and clear, because this is a most important and valuable
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:06.640]   argument for us as Christian people when we may be having a discussion with a moral type
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.560]   of person. You know the sort of person who's not a Christian and who says that he doesn't
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.240]   see any need for believing in our doctrines about the Son of God coming to earth and dying
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.520]   for our sins and so on. His whole case is that if you live a good life, that that is
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:28.040]   all that God demands, and that he claims that he's lived this good life. He hasn't committed
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.600]   certain sins. He does a lot of good. A highly moral person, you can't point a finger at
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.840]   him. Now how do you deal with such a person? Well, here is the wonderful argument which
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:44.840]   the Apostle provides for us. You start by saying, "Now look here, the law of God demands
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:51.320]   that a man should carry it out." Let me show you how the Apostle says the same thing again
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:59.560]   in chapter 10 of this great epistle and in the fifth verse. You'll read this, "For Moses
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:10.280]   describeth the righteousness which is of the law thus, that the men which doeth those things
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.880]   shall live by them." That's what the law says. The law doesn't say that the men who heareth
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:21.440]   these things shall live by them. No, no. The men who doeth these things shall live by them.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:27.280]   That's what law says. The law says, "If you do what I tell you, well then you shall live.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:33.160]   You shall have salvation." Now let me quote for once a translation by Dr. Moffat, which
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.360]   I think is quite useful at this point. He translates it like this, Romans 10, 5, "Anyone
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.080]   who can perform it shall live by it." That's it. "Anyone who can perform it shall live
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:55.240]   by it. If you keep this law, you will be justified in the presence of God." Very well. But what
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:02.840]   is this "it"? What is this law which I've got to keep, and which when I keep it I shall
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:09.800]   be justified before God? That's the question. If I keep the law, I shall be justified before
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:15.080]   God. Very well. What is the law that I've got to keep? Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   has answered the question. You remember the lawyer came to him and said, "Which is the
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:30.000]   first and the chiefest commandment of the law?" And our Lord answered and said, "Thou
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.160]   shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.560]   thy strength." That is the first and the greatest commandment. And the second is like unto it,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:54.000]   "Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself." That is the Lord's summary of the law. Now
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.800]   then, go to the Jew, go to your highly moral person, and say, "Right, right, you're perfectly
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.240]   correct when you say that if a man keeps the law, that he's justified in the presence of
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.160]   God. Do you say that you've kept the law?" Well, he says, "I've never done this, I've
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.280]   never done that." But you say, "That isn't what the law demands." What the law demands
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   is that you should love God with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:23.240]   and all your strength, and that you should love your neighbor as yourself. Are you doing
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   that? If not, you haven't kept the law, and you're not justified. You're condemned, you're
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:38.040]   damned, you're lost. Or, take it as James puts it. James, you remember, in the second
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.120]   chapter of his epistle, deals again in a most remarkable manner with this, and it's a very
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.600]   vital bit of argumentation. Listen to him putting it like this, "If ye fulfill the royal
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   law according to the scripture, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' ye do well.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.360]   But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:09.240]   Now listen to this, verse 10, "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:16.880]   one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, 'Do not commit adultery,' said also,
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.840]   'Do not kill.' Now if thou commit no adultery, but if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:32.120]   of the law. Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:41.240]   of all." Now that is, you see, a very definite and a very final answer to all who imagine
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:46.400]   for a moment that the apostle is here saying that there are certain Jews who will be found
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.800]   in glory because they've carried out the law, and have thereby justified themselves before
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:59.880]   God. He is saying nothing of the sort. He is simply reminding these Jews who are foolish
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.000]   and ignorant enough to think that a man ever could keep the law, he is simply telling them
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.320]   this, "Look here, let me remind you of what the law does demand, and the moment you see
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.440]   that you'll see that no man has ever done or kept the law." Did you notice this word
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:21.400]   "do" in verse 14? "For when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:30.440]   in the law." Now he's not saying there for a second that these Gentiles have kept the
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:37.680]   whole law. Of course, the thing is patently impossible. All he is saying is that they
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:44.400]   do certain things which the law does demand. They don't do everything. The Gentiles are
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.760]   no more capable of fulfilling the whole law than the Jews were. Nobody can. If you offend
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.080]   in one point, you've offended in all. No man is therefore justified by the deeds of the
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:02.120]   law, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. Or as he puts again in the third verse of
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.520]   the eighth chapter of this great epistle, "For what the law could not do in that it
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:14.480]   was weak through the flesh." Man's flesh is too weak. He cannot keep the law. Well, then
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.320]   there is our argument with regard to that second matter. The apostle is not saying that
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   anyone ever has or ever can keep the law and thereby be justified. Let me come to a third
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:44.040]   statement. He is not saying that the Gentiles have the law written in their hearts. Now
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.360]   you notice that I pointed out just now in the exposition that the apostle doesn't even
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.440]   say in words that they have the law written in their hearts, but that they have the works
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.520]   of the law written in their hearts. That's enough in itself. But let me give you some
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:07.560]   further arguments. It cannot mean that the Gentiles have the law of God as such written
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:14.320]   in their hearts. Because, as I've already just been pointing out to you, the first great
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:21.040]   statement of the law is about a man's attitude towards God, this loving of God with the whole
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.000]   of our being. Indeed, in chapter 1 he is told us that the only knowledge that the Gentiles
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.120]   have of God is that they have a certain knowledge of his power as creator. They have some vague
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:40.600]   notion of his power and of his deity, but that isn't a knowledge of God in his being
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:46.800]   and in his character and in his person. So he'd be again contradicting himself if he
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.120]   suddenly said here that they have this law of God written in their hearts. But take this
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:59.640]   argument which to me is a very vital one. If it is true that the apostle is here saying
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:05.160]   that these Gentiles have the law of God written in their hearts, well then he is saying that
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.840]   they're actually superior to the Jews who only had it written in tables of stone outside
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.720]   themselves. It's a greater thing to have the law in your heart than to have it on tables
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.560]   of stone. And all that we are told about the Jews is that they have them on tables of stone.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.760]   He's therefore saying here that the Gentiles were superior to the Jews because they've
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.240]   got it in their hearts, whereas the Jews have only got it externally. Which is again, of
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:39.400]   course, to make the thing ridiculous. Or a third argument, and equally powerful, is this.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:46.600]   If it is true that the Gentiles have this law of God written in their hearts, then they
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:54.080]   have already anticipated what is promised as coming in the new covenant. Do you remember
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.760]   how in Jeremiah 31 you read, "God said through the prophet, 'A new covenant will I make
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.160]   with you, not like the covenant that I made with you when I brought you out of the captivity
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.960]   of Egypt. I will make a new covenant with you,' he says. And you'll find it quoted
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.400]   in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. What is the great characteristic
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:20.920]   of the new covenant? It's this, Hebrews 8.10, "I will put my laws in their mind and write
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:28.560]   them in their hearts." Now, that was never true of the Jews. God gave the Jews the laws
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.720]   on the tables of stone. He didn't write them in their minds then, nor in their hearts.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.920]   But he says, "I'm going to make a new covenant with you when I send the Messiah, and this
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.640]   will be the great characteristic of the new covenant. I will put my laws in your mind
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.240]   and write them in your hearts." And yet, you see, this argument tells us that Paul
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:52.560]   is saying here that he'd already written them in the hearts of the Gentiles long ago,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.640]   and from the very beginning that God had done this thing which he's only promising to
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:03.320]   do when the new covenant comes in. Surely, therefore, there can be no question about
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:11.680]   this. The apostle is not teaching here that the Gentiles have the law of God written in
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.960]   their hearts. There is no teaching in the scripture about some natural law written in
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.560]   the hearts of men. All he claims for them is that they've got a certain moral sense
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.480]   and a moral consciousness. And that brings me to the last matter which
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:37.520]   comes under this negative heavy. The apostle does not teach in this parenthesis that if
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:46.600]   we live up to the life that we have, we shall be saved. Why do I say that? Well, for this
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:58.000]   reason that what he is actually saying here and in the entire passage is that no one ever
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.760]   does live up to the light that he has, whether he be a Jew or whether he be a Gentile. The
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.200]   light that the Jews had was the light of the law given through Moses. None of them lived
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:17.320]   up to it. The light that the Gentile has is this moral consciousness. None of them live
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:23.200]   up to it. That's why they can accuse one another and try to excuse themselves. They have all
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.160]   sinned, even against their moral consciousness. Nobody does or can live up to the light that
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:36.720]   he has. So how foolish it is to say that we can save ourselves by doing that.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:44.240]   But still more important, if you say that a man can save himself by living up to the
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:51.160]   light that he has, well then I say that there is no need for the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.600]   He need never have left heaven. He need never have come into the world. He need never have
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:03.160]   died upon the cross on Calvary's hill. If a man can save himself by living up to the
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.800]   light he has, how often do we say that glibly? I'm afraid even those of us who are Christians,
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.280]   are the Gentiles. They never heard the gospel, but they say they live up to the light they
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.440]   have. No one ever does, no one ever can. And if anybody could, I say Christ would never
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:22.680]   have been necessary. But the whole teaching of the Bible from beginning to end is that
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:32.160]   he and he alone is the Savior. There is no salvation outside Christ. One God and one
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.960]   mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:44.880]   And finally, as a very practical argument, have you ever considered this? If you really
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:51.520]   believe that a man can save himself by living up to the light he has, well then you must
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:59.120]   stop supporting foreign mission work. Because by sending missionaries from this land to
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.200]   pagan lands, and teaching them the Bible, teaching them the Ten Commandments and the
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.360]   moral law, and the Sermon on the Mountain, things like that, you're putting before
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:15.400]   them an altogether higher standard than they had before. And you're therefore making
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   things still more difficult and impossible for them. It would have been much better to
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.280]   leave them where they were, where they're low standard. They stand a better chance of
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.000]   coming up to that. They don't even come up to that. But that's easier and more hopeful
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.200]   and inerrant than this other standard which is infinitely higher. It's a complete condemnation
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:41.560]   of the missionary enterprise. In fact, the whole thing is quite monstrous
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:50.480]   and utterly ridiculous. The apostle is teaching none of these things whatsoever in this important
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:57.040]   and vital parenthesis. Now alas, our time is gone, and I shall have to leave the positive
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:03.120]   what he does teach, which is much simpler, much simpler, and can be said in a much shorter
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   time until next Friday. And then, having done that, I will still try to take up certain
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.000]   problems which are so frequently raised on the basis of this parenthesis. What of the
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.920]   pagans? What of those Greek philosophers before Christ ever came? And so on and so forth.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.000]   What of people like the father and mother of John the Baptist, who are described as
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.400]   just and righteous and so on? What of them? We'll try to deal with those questions and
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:43.440]   those problems after we have given our positive exposition. Let us pray.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:55.920]   O God, we thank thee that again we can come before thee. We have been reminded and have
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:04.160]   reminded one another once more of how prone we are to error and to wonder, how trusting
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:12.040]   to our own intellects and understandings, and how in our desire to justify ourselves,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:19.400]   we can, as thy servant the apostle Peter of old said, rest the Scriptures to our own destruction.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:28.640]   O God, we pray thee to ever keep us humble, grant us the childlike mind, grant us that
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:37.600]   simplicity. Teach us, O God, to shed our own conceptions, preconceived notions and ideas,
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:45.320]   and to come in utter simplicity to thy Word, not to buttress our arguments, but to discover
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:52.640]   what the Word really teaches us, and dependent upon the unction and the enlightenment of
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:43:00.320]   thy Holy Spirit. O God, forgive us for all our faults and errors and failures in connection
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:07.800]   with thy most holy things. Cleanse us, we pray thee, by the blood of Christ. O God,
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:14.000]   we thank thee more than ever that we are saved by thy grace, and that we are thy workmanship,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.200]   and that it in no sense depends upon us, for we see that we are ever prone to wonder, and
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:28.080]   so subject and liable to error. We give thee therefore all the praise in the knowledge
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:35.200]   that the work which thy goodness began, the arm of thy strength will complete. Cure us,
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:43.440]   O Lord, and receive our humble praise. And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.400]   Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:56.600]   and continue with us, now this night and evermore. Amen.
