[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.000]   - Mr. Rovi Lopez, a listener from the Philippines,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.960]   Pastor John, I love the Bible.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.400]   I want my whole life to be gladly given
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.480]   to know Jesus Christ and the scriptures.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.440]   So how do you memorize the Bible?
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040]   And what would you advise a 20-year-old like me?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.120]   Where should I start?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.880]   - Well, I do have a concrete idea
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   where I'd like him to start.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.820]   And it's partly because of where I'm starting here
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.680]   at the beginning of the year.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.960]   I was asked at the Cross Conference several weeks ago
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   in Louisville about Bible memorization,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.320]   and I was very excited.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.000]   This was just before David Platt stood up to speak,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.520]   which is kind of an amazing providence
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.920]   because David recited from memory
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.920]   the entire Romans 1 to 8 in front of 3,500 students,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.840]   and we were all wonderfully blown away.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.580]   In fact, it's interesting just to show the power
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.700]   of the memorized and recited word.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.420]   I know a young woman, 13 years old, who was saved,
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.660]   she says, between chapters four and five of that recitation.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.520]   I heard about that the next morning after that.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.060]   So I just want to encourage Rovi
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.100]   that it is worth whatever efforts you make
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.060]   to memorize the scriptures.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.620]   The reason I told those students
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.580]   that I'm setting off on a higher level of commitment
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.580]   to Bible memory in 2014 is one, because I'm getting older.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.500]   Things don't stick.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.280]   Short-term memory doesn't work so well
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.740]   in my brain like it used to,
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.100]   so I have to work harder to make things stick.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.700]   And so I need to beef up the time commitment
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.640]   and the intentionality of my scripture memory efforts,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.900]   which I want to do.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.820]   And another reason is because I've never met
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.340]   a strong Christian who doesn't give themselves
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.220]   to Bible reading and Bible memory.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940]   And all the weak and worldly Christians I know
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.100]   neglect the Bible, especially Bible memorization.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.620]   Love for the word of God and attention to it
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.020]   and memorization of it has always been a mark
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.940]   of the mature, it seems like, a signature.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.020]   It's a signature of the sanctified people.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.340]   Low-level interest in the Bible and Bible memory
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.620]   almost always goes hand-in-hand
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.020]   with high-level interest in superficial things.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.980]   And whenever Christians with high-level interest
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.420]   in superficial things hear this,
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.780]   they instinctively protect themselves
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.820]   and their love of superficial things
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.740]   by calling this legalistic.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.740]   They say this talk about focusing the Bible
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.420]   and reading the Bible and memorizing scripture is legalism.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.340]   And of course, it's not about earning anything
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.260]   and it's not about keeping rules.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260]   It's about what you love and what you're passionate about
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260]   and what you feel a need for in your heart.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.380]   Do you love God's word?
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.440]   Are you passionate about him and what he has said?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.340]   Do you feel a need for his word every day?
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.680]   Well, I do, and I do more than just in the morning
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.820]   when I read my Bible, I feel it all day long.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.220]   And so I want to treasure the Bible.
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.540]   Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.380]   If you treasure God and his word,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.340]   then your heart will be there, be there in his word.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.140]   And you'll want it to be there in the word all day long.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.760]   And one of the great ways to do that
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.540]   is to memorize scripture.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.460]   So I told those students,
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.420]   let's all memorize Romans 8 together.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.980]   So that's my concrete suggestion.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.940]   Where do you start?
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.680]   I would suggest that,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.440]   there are a lot of people who've never memorized
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.100]   a whole chapter of the Bible in their lives.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.800]   And I would just plead with Rovi
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   to give himself to Romans 8.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.120]   And my guess is the vast majority of those
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.080]   who've listened to this have never memorized Romans 8.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   I had never memorized a chapter in the Bible
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.520]   before I was 28 years old.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.780]   I had only worked on verses.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.660]   And then I heard Art Lewis recite in chapel
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.180]   at Bethel College, Matthew 6, 25 to 34.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.640]   That's all, just those verses on anxiety.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.700]   Don't be anxious about what you should eat
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.740]   or what you should drink.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.940]   He just recited.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.100]   And I was watching him and I said,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.180]   I've never seen anybody do that.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.020]   And isn't that amazing?
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.840]   I was 28, I was teaching at Bethel College,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.620]   and I was watching a man recite one single paragraph
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.620]   from the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.200]   And I was blown away by it
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.440]   because I'd never seen anybody stand up
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   and recite an entire paragraph of the Bible from memory.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.180]   And since then, I've just given myself to do it
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.360]   and I've seen the power of it.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.720]   I remember reciting Isaiah 53 from memory
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.340]   over a communion service one time
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.340]   and a woman just broke down with the power of it.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.520]   I remember reciting all of Revelation 5
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.280]   at a New Year's Eve service some years ago.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.920]   I did it again at Passion last year.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.680]   I remember reciting all of Psalm 118
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.440]   when the north campus of our church opened
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.760]   and I wanted to welcome the people
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.880]   with something significant.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.560]   And so I just recited that Psalm.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.080]   But the reason I suggest that we all get going
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.400]   with Romans 8, if we haven't done it,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.680]   is that this paragraph is probably the greatest.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.880]   I mean, this chapter is probably the greatest chapter
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.800]   in the Bible and it's always relevant.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.960]   It's always got something to say.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.480]   I told the students, I don't think you'll ever be
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.360]   in a situation where Romans 8 will not be useful to you.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.760]   It goes from no condemnation to the substitution of Christ
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   in our condemnation to peace and life
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.840]   that the Spirit brings, to the inability
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.240]   of the flesh to do anything,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.880]   to the promise of the resurrection,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.520]   to the assurance of our adoption
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.200]   and the witness of the Spirit,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.560]   to the promise of glorification
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.920]   and the sufferings of the entire creation
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   and the sufferings and groanings of us believers
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.720]   as we wait for redemption,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.840]   the struggle of prayer and the Spirit's help in prayer,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.560]   the great promise that everything works for our good,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   the foundation of that promise in predestination
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.300]   and calling and justification and glorification,
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.240]   the promise that He'll give us all things,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.640]   the impossibility of separating us from Christ,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.440]   the invincible love of God.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.520]   I mean, this chapter is just so full.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.320]   And so I wish every believer would give the time
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.240]   and effort to memorizing this chapter.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.840]   It's absolutely incomparable.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.160]   And I would love to talk about how to do it,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.360]   but maybe we've been probably going long enough.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.240]   Maybe we should do that tomorrow.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.040]   'Cause I have really concrete suggestions for Rovian,
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.200]   for anybody else who wants to know,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   well, how would you even go about memorizing
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.960]   a chapter of the Bible?
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.360]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.880]   And tomorrow we'll get into those concrete suggestions.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.120]   Until then, if you're looking for even more motivation
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.520]   to memorize scripture,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.640]   look in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.440]   for an episode titled Bible Memory as Ministry to Others.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.400]   That was episode number 131,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.240]   Bible Memory as Ministry to Others.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.000]   Bible memory has a key community dimension to it,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.840]   and that episode addresses it.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.580]   Also, for those of you who are writers,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.240]   there's an old episode titled Writing Poetry,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.200]   Where Do I Start?
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.960]   Which was episode number 24.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   And there, Pastor John commends the memorizing of the Psalms
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.240]   as a way to improve your stock of language as a writer.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.600]   And finally, speaking of the Cross Conference,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.800]   that was mentioned earlier,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.760]   you can watch all of the main sessions online right now
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.680]   at crosscon.com, crosscon.com.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.840]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
