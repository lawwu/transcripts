[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Hello and welcome to this short video to help you get started creating your first
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.120]   Weights & Biases project. Let's get started. Here you can see your Weights &
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.720]   Biases workspace. One thing to understand that's helpful early in your Weights &
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.200]   Biases journey is what we call a run. A run is just one unit of computation. So
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.380]   think every time you run your code that's a run. For example, every time you
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.560]   train your model and any data that you log during training that model that's
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.480]   associated with that run. Within this workspace you can see a bunch of runs on
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.740]   the left and as I hover over you can see what data is associated with each run
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.220]   and I can expand this table on the left and see the configs that are associated
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.420]   with them. Okay so that's your quick tour around a Weights & Biases workspace.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.820]   Let's dive into the code. So the first thing you'll want to do is pip install
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.620]   our Python client. Next you'll want to log in calling 1db.login. You'll be
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.740]   prompted to visit the app to get your API key and you can just paste that into
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.540]   the terminal to authorize Weights & Biases locally. After you import the 1db
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.300]   library the first thing you'll want to do is call 1db.init. You'll typically
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.140]   call this once per script and that's how you tell Weights & Biases to create a
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.060]   run behind the scenes. You can pass it a project name and a config variable to
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.780]   capture any hyper parameters or configurations that you want to
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.300]   associate with this specific experiment. The next thing you'll want to do is call
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.820]   1db.log. 1db.log is how you stream metrics to Weights & Biases during
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.180]   training for instance. To use 1db.log you just pass a dictionary where every
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.100]   entry in that dictionary is a metric at a given point in time. You can also log
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.660]   rich media like images or audio or even 3d molecules to see how your model
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.860]   predictions change as your model gets better. Once you've added 1db.log and
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.780]   1db.init you can run your Python script and Weights & Biases will print out a
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.980]   link that'll send you to your workspace or that specific runs page. Navigate to
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.420]   your Weights & Biases workspace and see that specific run, training, streaming
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.620]   metrics to the app. Thank you very much for watching this video I hope it was
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.440]   helpful. If you do have any more questions feel free to ask them at
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.060]   community.1db.ai or check out the documentation at docs.1db.ai. There's
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.700]   plenty more to learn from here once you're finished learning about
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.260]   experiment tracking. You should check out how to version your datasets and models
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.940]   using artifacts, how to evaluate your models using tables or how to tune your
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.180]   hybrid parameters with Weights & Biases sweeps. That's it from me, thanks very
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.340]   much.
