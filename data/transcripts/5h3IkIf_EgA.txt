[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:15.020]   the 107th Psalm, Psalm 107, and I shall read from verse 33 to the end of the psalm, from
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.460]   verse 33 to verse 43 in the 107th Psalm.
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:29.260]   He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the water springs into dry ground; a fruitful
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.620]   land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.500]   He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into water springs;
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.300]   and there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation, and
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.180]   sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.820]   He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattle to
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.820]   decrease.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.220]   Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.260]   He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.460]   is no way; yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.460]   a flock.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.900]   The righteous shall see it and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:47.740]   Who so is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.460]   of the Lord.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.340]   Now those who attend here regularly will know that we are looking at this great psalm for
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.940]   the sixth time.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:10.260]   It is one of those mighty psalms, one of the greatest of all the psalms, and it is a psalm
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:17.660]   that is full of interest, as we have seen, regarded from almost every conceivable standpoint.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.500]   Its very structure is interesting.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.940]   It has a very definite form.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.820]   There is a preliminary introduction in three verses, you remember, in which the man says,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.140]   "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.180]   Let the redeemed of the Lord say so," he goes on, "whom he hath redeemed from the hand of
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.700]   the enemy, and gathered them out of the land from the east and from the west, from the
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.660]   north and from the south."
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660]   That is his introduction.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.140]   And there he really introduces us to the theme.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.260]   His theme is that God is to be praised because he is who he is, because he is what he is,
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.500]   because of what he does to the children of men.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.740]   All salvation, he says, is of God and comes from God, and that is why God alone is to
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.500]   be praised.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.940]   And he says that all men should be doing this.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.060]   He says that certainly the redeemed must do it, because they all have experienced it,
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.640]   and they all have a common experience.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.460]   And he wants to make sure that we do understand that it is a common experience.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.900]   So he goes on to prove that point in the way that I have been indicating to you.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   He gives us four pictures, which appear to be four entirely different types of persons
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.060]   and of individuals, and yet he goes out to show that in every single case there is that
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.180]   common factorâ€”need, failure, distress.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.380]   And how these men, in all their varying distresses, cried out unto the Lord, and he heard them
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.300]   and delivered them, and they praised him for his goodness.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.220]   Well, he does that, I say, in his four pictures.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:18.660]   And that brings us to the end of the thirty-second verse where we left off last Sunday evening.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.820]   But you notice the psalm does not stop there.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.860]   It goes on to the verses that I have just read to you from verse thirty-three to the
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.140]   end in verse forty-three.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.020]   Why does he go on?
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.740]   Why didn't he stop, you think?
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.700]   Well, I say this is again a part of the essential structure of the psalm.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.820]   The man who wrote this psalm, like all the psalmists, was not simply writing for our
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.260]   delectation or interest or amusement or entertainment.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.340]   These men were servants of God.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.020]   They were preachers.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.060]   They had been given the poetic gift, so they expressed their teaching in this particular
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.060]   form.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.100]   But they are not poets, primarily.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.940]   They are not literatures, I say, in any sense.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.700]   And their interest is not in the art as such.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.700]   There is art here.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.220]   There is wonderful art here.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.500]   It's amazing poetry, as we've seen.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.380]   If you judge it from the standpoint of diction or its descriptive power or apply any of your
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.340]   canons of literary criticism, you have to award it very high marks indeed.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.980]   But I say those are all incidentals.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.740]   They didn't write in order to produce masterpieces of literature.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.620]   They were out to teach people.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.620]   They were out to convey a message.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.220]   They were preachers.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.940]   They were evangelists, so that always they take great care that all they've been saying
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.600]   is brought to a point and to a focus and that it is applied.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.660]   Now this man does precisely that.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.580]   And in this concluding portion, which we are looking at this evening, he not only brings
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:22.260]   his own poem to an end, and from the architectonic point of view, produces this perfect symmetry,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.820]   but I say in addition, he completes his message.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.440]   He brings us to the point at which he's anxious to arrive.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.300]   In other words, I'm suggesting to you that what he's doing is this.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.500]   He seems to be asking a question, and his question is this.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.060]   Do you see the point of all I've been saying?
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.480]   Have you been so interested in my pictures that you've missed the point of them?
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.300]   Have you been so captivated by my art and by my dramatic powers that you've just gone
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.180]   home talking to yourselves and thinking to one another and thinking to yourselves about
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.660]   the drama and about the picture and about the excitement?
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.060]   Have you seen the message, he seems to ask?
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.100]   Have you seen the picture?
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.820]   Have you really seen the thing that I'm out to convey?
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.300]   Now he says if you haven't, well then, my labor is in vain, but he's not going to take
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.140]   any risks with us.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.300]   Like the good teacher that he is, and it's so characteristic of the Bible and the biblical
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.900]   method everywhere, he takes out the lessons himself for us.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.340]   He says this is what I'm teaching, and he underlines it.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.460]   And then, having extracted the principles out of his own teaching, as he states them
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.980]   here from verse 33 to verse 42, he ends up with a final word of appeal and says, "Whoso
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:59.980]   is wise and will observe these things, even they, they are the people who shall understand
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.140]   the loving kindness of the Lord."
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.260]   Now that's his method, that's the analysis of the psalm, and that puts this concluding
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:17.180]   portion that we are now examining into its context, so that we can see exactly what this
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.660]   man is going to invite us to do.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.900]   Let me put it to you, therefore, in this form.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.700]   This book, which we call the Bible, is God's book of life.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.700]   I've been reminding you that in it we have this incomparable poetry.
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.780]   Well, we could equally say that we have marvelous history in it.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.780]   There are all sorts of themes and subjects in this book, but it isn't an encyclopedia.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.700]   This is the textbook of life, it's the manual of the soul.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:01.700]   It's got one great message, and that one great message is life, and how life is to
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.700]   be lived, how life is to be enjoyed.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:12.100]   The end of life, the object of life, the purpose of life, the way to live life, that's its
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.100]   theme.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:19.540]   It's the only theme, and you've got it in this psalm as you've got it everywhere.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.700]   Look at it like this, if you like.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.740]   Here we are, all of us, in this life and in this world.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:36.060]   Now, the very fact, I take it, that we are in this building at this moment, is proof
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.860]   in and of itself that that to us is something that is to be contemplated, something that
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.940]   is to be meditated upon.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.140]   I take it that the very fact that we are here means this, that we are not content like so
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:58.580]   many are, just to take things as they come, and never to stand and stand apart for a moment
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:07.300]   and look at life and look at ourselves and say, "Well, here I am in this world, but what's
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.700]   its meaning, what's its subject, what's its purpose?"
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:18.040]   And then you go on to say to yourself, "Well, I not only know that I'm in this life and
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.900]   in this world, I know that I'm only here once.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:33.220]   I'm here at this moment and I'm doing something that I shall never do again, in a sense."
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.620]   Life is something that we just go through once.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.060]   So it's a tremendous thing.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.140]   Now every thoughtful person arrives at some such conclusions, and he begins to look at
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.200]   life and at himself in that kind of context and in that sort of way.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.220]   Not only that, he's lived long enough to know that in this life and in this world, certain
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.240]   things happen to us.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.340]   We saw that very clearly last Sunday night in that picture of the storm at sea.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.940]   Oh, the Bible's full of it.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:13.740]   Life brings its problems, it brings its emergencies, it brings its trials.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.580]   Well, we begin to experience them, and we begin to know something about them, and anxieties
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.720]   and worry tend to follow in their wake.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.420]   And things happen to us, as we know from the outside.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:33.620]   Well, here we are at this moment in the history of the world, just as things are this evening.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.540]   And we are aware of certain powers and certain forces in life and in the world.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.060]   And of course they affect us.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.420]   Because though we are just small units, as it were, and in a sense the great world seems
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.980]   to be quite indifferent to us, we know that everything that happens in the world is going
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.720]   to affect us.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.500]   So that we can't say, "Oh, well, that's an international problem, it's got nothing to
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   do with me."
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.420]   Of course, it's got everything to do with me.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.780]   If a war comes, I'm affected, I'm involved, all our relationships are immediately involved
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.780]   and disturbed.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:14.820]   Well, very well, here we are, we're in a world like that, with that kind of condition, and
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.340]   we are passing through it.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:27.060]   And I say the thoughtful person stops with that kind of thing and pauses and looks at
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.780]   it and says, "Well, now then, what is all this?
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.820]   Is there any reason?
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.060]   Is there any explanation of it all?
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.540]   What am I to do about it?
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.980]   How am I to get through with it?
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.700]   How can I keep on my feet, as it were, and refuse to be knocked down?
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:50.140]   How can I stand up and not be submerged and to be drawn into that vortex and, oh, just
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.140]   be carried along without knowing what's happening to me?"
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:13:00.220]   Now the thoughtful people from the commencement of human history have stood up like that and
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.140]   have asked their questions.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.380]   And the thing they've always asked is this, "Where is wisdom?"
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.700]   Job puts it to us, you remember, "Where is wisdom to be found?"
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.180]   That's the question.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:20.500]   Yes, I can track the course that is pursued by that serpent in the rocks.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.260]   I understand the way of the cones and so on.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.820]   You remember how he puts it again in his poetry.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.340]   But the great question is this, "Where is wisdom to be found?"
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.980]   I know where precious metals are to be found.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.420]   I know where I can get coal.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.060]   I know where I can get gold.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.340]   I know where silver is to be mined.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.980]   These things I know, but the question is, "Where is wisdom?"
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:51.740]   It's been the great quest, the great endeavor, the great cry of mankind from the very dawn
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.460]   of history down until this very evening.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:05.260]   Well now then, it is precisely to answer that question that this man wrote this 107th Psalm.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.020]   That's exactly why he wrote it.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.900]   As I told you, he didn't write this simply in order to paint his wonderful pictures and
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:19.620]   to have the marvelous satisfaction of the artist of having produced an amazing artistic
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.620]   work.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.620]   He didn't write all this in order that it might be put up in some sort of gallery, and
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.540]   when we've got nothing better to do, we pay our shilling or our pound or whatever it is,
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.620]   and just go around and look at and admire the amazing art which is displayed.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   Not at all.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:42.900]   He is a man who knows something of the life, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.220]   And because in the goodness and the mercy of God, he's been led to true wisdom that
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.820]   he passes it on to us.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:58.740]   Now that is something that the Bible says in a thousand and one places.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.980]   It's a great theme, a particularly favorite theme in the Book of Psalms.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:08.460]   There it's put generally quite boldly in this form, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.740]   of wisdom."
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.340]   You haven't started to be wise until you've realized this.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.580]   Everything else is sort of prolegomena, mere introduction.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:27.180]   "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.420]   And the man who hasn't got the fear of the Lord knows nothing at all about wisdom.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.420]   Now then, wait a minute.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.340]   Let's see how this man puts it.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:42.060]   I say that nothing matters, according to the psalmist here, save our relationship to God.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.340]   I know.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:51.140]   But you know, if you merely look at life superficially and in general, you won't realize that at
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.340]   all.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:58.640]   Because if you look at life on the surface, as all people do by nature, and as all do
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.940]   who don't realize the vital importance of knowing God, well, you take things as they
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.060]   appear.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.380]   And if you merely look at things as they appear, you would come to the conclusion that really
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.500]   God has got nothing at all to do with it.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:22.460]   And that is exactly where we are all by nature, and as the result of sin, led astray.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.460]   How does man look at life without God?
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.540]   Well, here we are told, listen.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.780]   Man without God looks at life and looks at the world, and what does he see?
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:40.020]   Rivers, and water springs, and a fruitful land.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.460]   But he notices that not only is there that, but there is something very different.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:56.060]   He notices that there are such things as wildernesses, and dry and barren ground.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.980]   Now that's just observation, isn't it?
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:13.460]   Water springs, amazing rivers, fruitful lands, oh yes, but barrenness, wilderness, nothing
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.820]   growing at all.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.820]   And corresponding to that, you notice that he tells us that there are such things in
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.820]   the world as princes.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:26.020]   There are some people who are in great power and in great dominion, and they have crowns
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.340]   upon their heads, they're princes.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.180]   But not only does he notice that there are princes in this world, there are poor people.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.540]   Now then, here is a man, you see, just looking at life.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.740]   And he says, "Yes, that's quite right, that is very true.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.140]   I notice that that is true of this world and of life.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:56.500]   I notice that as I go on a journey in a train or in a motor car, there's a curious variation.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:02.340]   I go through the most fertile plains, and then I come to a patch of land which is quite
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.340]   barren.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.200]   I see nothing but some herbs and rushes there.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.260]   Nothing seems to be growing, there's none of that luscious grass there.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.700]   Then I go to other places, it's just rock, you can see the rock coming out through the
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.820]   surface, it's valueless, it's hopeless."
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.300]   That's perfectly right, and I notice that as I look at men, there seems to be a kind
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.360]   of corresponding variation.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.020]   Some people are very successful, others never seem to make anything of it.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   Some are very wealthy and some are very poor.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:36.340]   There is life, he says, I look at it and I notice that it's characterized by divisions
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:43.540]   and distinctions, based upon heredity, based upon accident, based upon ability, based upon
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.380]   a man's industry, his ingenuity, his zeal, his application, and so on and so forth.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:57.460]   Now, there are facts, that's just sheer observation.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:04.820]   Ah yes, but the vital question is, how do you explain all that?
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.580]   What accounts for all this?
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.380]   It's no use denying the facts, but the interesting thing is the explanation of it.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.380]   How can I become a prince?
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.580]   That's the question.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.300]   How can I become a very wealthy man?
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.620]   I don't want to be poor.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.460]   How can I have this fruitful end, as it were, and become fruitful myself?
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.160]   That's the great question.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:28.940]   What is the meaning of all this inequality that one sees, and all this variety and variation?
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:35.020]   Now, that's the crucial question.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.820]   The world, as I say, thinks it's got a very adequate explanation.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.220]   Some say it's but accident and chance.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.060]   There's no rhyme and reason in it at all.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.620]   Things are what they are, and they will be what they will be, and that's it.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   That's all you can say.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.140]   They say there is no design, there's nothing here at all.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:02.140]   That's your fatalist, and he's sometimes a scientist, but he's a fatalist.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.500]   And there are others who say, as I've indicated, that it can be explained in terms of heredity,
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   perhaps.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.460]   Others say it's the law of supply and demand.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.820]   Others say that it's a whole question of a man's ability and his application, and that
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.020]   life is what you make of it.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.260]   And they say there's no need to talk about God.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.180]   A man makes his own bed.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.100]   A man determines his own fate.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.340]   A man rarely reaps what he himself has sown.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.540]   And everything is the result of what a man himself has done about life in this world.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:41.500]   Now, that's the attitude I think you'll agree of the vast majority of people today.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.060]   God is not in their thoughts at all.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.940]   The fool hath said in his heart there is no God.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.700]   And they say there is no God because there's no need of a God, if you can explain the world
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:57.220]   in terms of science and evolution and development, and if you can explain the whole of history
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:03.260]   in terms of some dialectic or some economic dialectic or something like that, and certain
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.140]   laws that you think you can discover there, well, God is just unnecessary.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.980]   And that is the prevailing attitude and opinion, as you know, that we don't believe in God
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:22.940]   today because we know so much that we know that God isn't needed, he's not necessary.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.060]   But that according to this menace, it is the message of the whole Bible, as I've been reminding
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.340]   you, is the very essence of following.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.140]   The one thing we can be certain of is this, that everything is under God and is in God's
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.420]   hands and that God controlleth everything.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   Listen to him.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:50.700]   "He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the water springs into dry ground, a fruitful
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:58.340]   land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.420]   And on the other end he turneth the wilderness into standing water, and dry ground into water
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.740]   springs, and there he maketh the hungry to dwell.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:19.580]   Yes, he setteth the poor on high, he treats the princes, we are told, with contempt.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:28.660]   He laughs at them, but he takes the poor and maketh him families like a flock, the same
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.380]   God who poureth contempt upon princes."
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:38.320]   Now this is the great first article of the Christian faith, as it is the first message
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:47.620]   of the Bible, and that is that God is over all, that the Lord reigneth.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.540]   Well, you say, "Why are things as they are then?"
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:58.220]   Well, the answer of the Bible is this, that we are confronted by the mind of eternal God
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:05.340]   which eludes our understanding, but that there is an understanding, that there is a purpose,
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.180]   and that there is a design.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.860]   But that when we apply our own little canons of thought to it, we are often bewildered
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:21.220]   and baffled, and God seems to us to be inconsistent, simply because of our failure to understand.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.820]   For we are told this about him, that he causeth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:33.380]   and sendeth his rain upon the just and upon the unjust.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.980]   God is over all, yes, but he permits certain things.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:43.820]   He permits the evil to flourish for a while like the green bay tree.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.580]   And the fact that that man is flourishing like the green bay tree doesn't mean that
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   there isn't a God.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.020]   That's how people argue, isn't it?
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.140]   "Oh," they say, "if there is a God, and if God is what you say he is, you couldn't
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.860]   have the position that we see it.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.380]   You say that unless a man lives a godly life, God isn't for him and he will be doomed."
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.380]   But look at it.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.380]   Look at the world.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.580]   Look at the way in which the people who deny God and laugh at him, look at their flourishing,
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.780]   look at their great success.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:14.060]   "Where's your God?" they say, "Where's your consistency?"
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.780]   But I have given you the answer of the Bible.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:27.900]   God allows rivers to flow, he allows water springs to spring up, but it's all in his
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.780]   hand, it's all under his control.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.300]   He can reverse it in a second.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:41.660]   He doesn't do it always, but he can, he's over it all, "the Lord reigneth, let the
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.660]   earth tremble."
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:52.900]   Now that is its first, I say, and its great fundamental message, that though we don't
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:25:00.300]   always understand it, and though we can't see it very clearly at times, that nevertheless
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.880]   we are all in his hands.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.660]   Now that's the wonderful thing about the Bible, and that is where these historical
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.580]   portions of the Bible are so invaluable.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.780]   You see, they give us these great panoramic views of history.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.860]   They take in these great epochs in a great sweep.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.580]   That's the astounding thing about them.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.180]   And you're standing with God, as it were, when you're reading the Bible, and you're
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.660]   looking down upon the stream of history.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.920]   And so often as you look superficially, you say, "Well, there's no God.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   Look what's happening.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.680]   Look at that great dynasty coming up.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.800]   Look at that mighty empire arising, and look where God's people are.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.400]   Ah, that's only the temporary view.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   Take a long view.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.280]   Keep on looking, and you'll see if you follow it on that God was there the whole time, and
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.520]   when he had decided in he came, as it were, he erupted into it all, and all your history
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.880]   seems to be turned upside down."
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:08.120]   That's the great message of this book, that we're all in the hands of God.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.360]   And that though things may seem to be working to the contrary, that this is the fact, and
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.100]   that any clear view of history brings it out in a most amazing manner.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.900]   But let me go on and put that to you in a little more detail.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:31.580]   That then is our first principle, that the one thing we have to grasp is that the most
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:38.260]   vital and important thing in the world is our relationship to God.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.820]   Very well then, the second principle arises, doesn't it, by a logical necessity, and I
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.960]   put it like this.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.540]   Nothing is so vitally urgent and important, therefore, for all of us this evening as to
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:27:00.260]   know the truth about God, the truth about God.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:08.100]   And my friends, the Bible is a book which is devoted to that theme, that's its message.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.180]   The Bible is a revelation of God.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:17.660]   Yes, that's the great thing, not that you and I may have something primarily, but that
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.260]   we may know God.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.540]   The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into this world, why primarily?
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.580]   Still the same.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.140]   No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten which is in the bosom of the Father,
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.940]   he hath declared him.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.540]   God who in sundry times and in sundry manners spake to the fathers by the prophets, hath
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:50.260]   in these last days spoken unto us in his Son, revelation, God revealing the truth about
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.700]   himself to men.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.700]   Why?
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:28:01.780]   Well, because it's the fundamental cardinal article in wisdom.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:07.620]   And therefore I say this evening that the most important thing for you and for me and
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:14.580]   for all of us is to know the truth about God.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.020]   Infinitely more important than that you should know if there is going to be another war or
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.660]   not.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.740]   Infinitely more important than any other particular subject you may chance to be interested in.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.740]   This is the thing.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.740]   Why?
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.220]   Well, I've already given you the reason.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:37.220]   You and I are but pilgrims and strangers, travelers and sojourners, here today and
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.780]   gone tomorrow.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:45.380]   Living our life in this world we are doing something that we only do once, we'll never
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:52.260]   come back again into it, and our eternal destiny depends upon what we do now.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.420]   So it isn't just a question of how to enjoy life in this world, it's the safeguarding
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.740]   of my eternal future, and it all depends upon my knowledge of God.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.740]   What is God like?
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.740]   Who is God?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.780]   How am I to know this God?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.140]   What is my relationship to him?
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.420]   You've got the answer here in this men's pictorial form.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:20.340]   And may God give us grace and by his Spirit enable us to receive the truth.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:26.580]   The whole trouble in the world tonight is due to the fact that men have their own ideas
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.380]   of God and don't come to the Bible for it.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.300]   How constantly one's being told this.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.540]   I was only told it this morning by a friend with whom I was having a conversation who
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.140]   was concerned about a loved one and a dear one.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:46.260]   "This is what he says," said the friend, "he doesn't see nor understand how a God
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:52.300]   of love can do this or that," it's always that, isn't it?
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.140]   My friend, I haven't the time to argue it out tonight but let me put it to you like
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.980]   this quite simply.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:04.540]   What do we really know of God apart from this book?
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.500]   Have you ever tried to face that question?
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.540]   What authority have you got for your viewers?
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.820]   You say, "But that's your thought, that's your philosophy, and you don't know everything
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:20.580]   and your mind is not perfect like mine and yet we base our view of God upon what we think
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.900]   God ought to be like."
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.860]   That's essential folly.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:30.300]   No, no, if we are to know anything about God we've got to come to this book and we've
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.100]   got to believe and accept its revelation.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.660]   I say that you can read your philosophers and you'll find that they've never arrived
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.300]   at him, they don't know, they call him the ultimate reality or the absolute or some kind
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.980]   of philosophic X. How does that help us?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.740]   No, no, there is no knowledge of God except the knowledge he's given and this is the record
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.740]   of what he's given.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   This is the revelation and above all you see it in his dear Son who came from heaven in
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.620]   order to bring it to us and what do we know then about God?
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.900]   Well, here are the things that are revealed.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:20.980]   God is righteous, God is just, God is holy, God is light, and in him is no darkness at
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.980]   all.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:29.380]   Take it, if you like, in the words of this man, "He turneth rivers into a wilderness
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:35.220]   and the water springs into dry ground, a fruitful land into barrenness," why does he do it?
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:41.580]   Here's the answer, "for the wickedness of them that dwell therein."
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.300]   Wickedness.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.980]   And later on in this same passage we've got this other term, iniquity.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.340]   Haven't we had it in our four pictures as we've looked at them one by one?
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.340]   Why have all those people got into distress?
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.780]   Isn't it always the same thing?
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:01.820]   Fools because of their iniquity, because they've contemned the words and the counsel of the
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:07.500]   Most High, it's because of their rebellion, their arrogance, their sin, all that is but
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:21.220]   an emphasis of the justice and the righteousness and the holiness of God.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.900]   Can the world forget that?
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.700]   The world not only forgets it, it hates it.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:37.020]   And the world is as it is tonight because it doesn't believe that God is righteous.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:43.220]   It wants a God who will be just an agency to dole out blessings and happiness when we
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:48.780]   need them, and who will wink at our sins and say, "It's all right, I take no notice."
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:54.980]   Oh, that's the world's idea, and there's nothing that the natural man hates so much tonight
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:03.340]   as this doctrine of the righteousness and the holiness and the justice of God.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:15.940]   But my dear friend, whether you and I like it or not, the fact is that God is like that.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:27.420]   His own dear Son addressing him always said, "Holy Father, righteous Father, God dwelleth
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:36.860]   in a light that is unapproachable, a burning light, an eternal light."
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.140]   That's the first thing, therefore, and it's emphasized here everywhere, and this man would
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.140]   never see it.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.780]   He says, "Whoso is wise will observe these things."
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:50.620]   The second thing he tells us about God is His greatness and His power.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.660]   It's the great theme of the Bible, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.660]   earth."
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:03.060]   God the creator, God the controller, God the sustainer of everything.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.220]   This man brings it out with particular force in his poetry.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.020]   He tells us that there is nothing that God cannot do.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.100]   He can turn a river into a wilderness.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.580]   He can turn a water spring into dry ground.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:21.500]   He can take a fruitful end and make it absolutely barren.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.540]   Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.500]   With God, nothing shall be impossible.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:37.860]   Our first hymn tonight put it so well, "He can create and He destroys."
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.380]   You see, this man is anxious that we should see that.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.900]   He's been telling us in the four pictures of the marvelous deliverances God has given.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   Well, how does He do it?
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.620]   Well, He does it in terms of His greatness and of His power.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.060]   He is the God who's over all, having made everything, He controls everything.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.860]   Nothing can consist and go on living apart from God.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:02.700]   He giveth breath and life to all things, and if He withdraws His breath, says the 104th
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:09.340]   Psalm, everything would collapse in a second.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:15.500]   The whole creation is in the hand of God, and if God were to withdraw His power for
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.380]   a second, the universe would collapse.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.180]   Do you know the scientists are beginning to say things like that?
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.700]   The more they understand the nature of an atom, the more convinced they are of this
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.060]   very thing.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:31.340]   Everything is being held, as it were, in this tremendous movement, in this great tension.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.260]   There's energy at the back of it all.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.620]   Where does that come from?
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.620]   God.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:41.460]   God at the back of it all, organizing, sustaining the Creator, the Artificer, the Sustainer
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   of everything that is.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.180]   That's His message.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.980]   And if you read these verses as I plead with you to do, watch His description of what God
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   can do.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.780]   He can tumble things upside down.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.820]   That mighty river can suddenly disappear, and that barrenness can spring up with water.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.300]   It can become a great lake, a standing pool.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   Why?
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.100]   It's the Creator who's doing it all.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:13.340]   There is no limit to His greatness and to His power.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.900]   I like these psalms.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.020]   I like these psalmists.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.580]   There he's been putting it about nature.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.660]   But listen to him putting it about men.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:30.180]   Listen to this, "He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:36.380]   wilderness where there is no way."
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:42.240]   There is no respect of persons with God.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.060]   There are no class and social distinctions where God is concerned.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.980]   There are no VIPs in the eyes of the Almighty.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.700]   There is no priority where He is concerned.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:03.980]   "He poureth contempt upon princes if they don't acknowledge Him and submit to Him.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.740]   Princes and lords may flourish or may fade.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:15.500]   A breath can make them as a breath hath made."
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.980]   Yes, this great God is a God of that type.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:27.260]   His greatness, His majesty, and His power, history is full of this.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.820]   Read your Old Testament, my friends.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.820]   The trouble with men today is they don't read and they don't know their Old Testament.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:37.460]   If you want to see God pouring His contempt upon princes, well, read the accounts given
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.020]   here of the great dynasties that rose.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.320]   Look at Egypt rising and striding the world as a colossus.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.820]   And then God poured His contempt upon her, and down she went, Pharaoh and his host overwhelmed
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.820]   in the Red Sea, a laughingstock to the nation.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:05.780]   That's the God whom the Bible reveals, the mightiest emperors and princes of Nineveh
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.220]   and of Greece and of any other country that's ever been.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:14.700]   "Unless they acknowledge Him, He'll pour contempt upon them."
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.340]   And they vanish out of sight.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:25.420]   The next thing that the Bible tells us about Him is the absolute certainty of judgment.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:32.180]   This God who is righteous and holy and just and who is so mighty and powerful is a God
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.860]   who is going to judge the world.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.940]   Oh, I know it's the height of unpopularity, isn't it?
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.700]   It's the thing the modern man absolutely hates, because if he didn't, you see, he'd be like
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.220]   his forefathers of a hundred years ago, who could be frightened by a sermon like this.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.420]   But the modern man, of course not.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.040]   He knows so much, he's so scientific.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.740]   But my dear friend, the facts are still exactly the same.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.740]   And all that this man's saying here is being proved and exemplified in the modern world
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.860]   at this very hour.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.980]   God is going to judge.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.780]   Here it is once more.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:14.780]   He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the water springs into dry ground, a fruitful
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:25.260]   land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:34.580]   I say it with reverence, God judges, because He's God, He must.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.100]   His holy nature insists upon it.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   And not only that, He's told us that He will judge.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.860]   You see, when He made man at the beginning, He told him quite plainly, "If you live like
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.180]   this, I'll bless you.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:53.340]   If you break my commandments, I will judge you."
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.260]   And the Old Testament is nothing but a record of this.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:03.500]   It began in Eden, though man was made in the image of God when he sinned, God judged him,
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.940]   and He turned him out of the garden and prevented his return.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.540]   That's the Bible, that's the gospel, that's an essential part of preaching Jesus Christ,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:20.700]   that man, in estrangement from God, is under the wrath of God.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.100]   Jesus Christ not only would never have come, but for that He would not have been needed,
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.420]   but for that.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.020]   The story of Eden is the story of judgment.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.460]   Go on and read the story of the flood.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.880]   Go and read about Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.700]   Go and read about Jerusalem, the city of God Himself, His chosen people, being attacked
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.500]   and sacked by the Chaldeans and reduced to a mass of rubble.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:53.340]   It's judgment, and it doesn't matter who they are, if it's their own people, if it's the
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.460]   man of his own choice, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:03.300]   Look at David, a favorite with God, and he sins, and God punishes him.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:12.940]   Preach the law of God, it's absolute, it's eternal, and hurry along to A.D. 70, when
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:18.500]   the Jewish nation, having rejected her own Messiah in the very person of the only begotten
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:25.980]   Son of God, was again surrounded by the Roman legionaries, and sacked and destroyed, and
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.300]   the temple smashed, and the nation thrown out amongst the other nations where they remain
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.700]   until tonight.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.700]   What is it?
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.700]   It's judgment.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.300]   History is full of it.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:47.460]   Go back, I say, and read again the Old Testament history, compare it with secular history,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.700]   look at it in subsequent history, nations rising with great pomp and apparently controlling
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.980]   the whole world.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:59.340]   They come up one after another, you Napoleons of various types, but the time comes when
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:08.220]   they're struck and they vanish and they've gone.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:13.860]   There seem to be powers and authorities and mights in the world today that cause us to
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   tremble.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:20.140]   In a sense it's right that we should tremble, but as I look at them all in the light of
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.580]   this psalm and the teaching of the Bible, there is a sense in which I almost tremble
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:33.540]   for them, in the hands of God, they're but as grasshoppers.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.500]   We read about their wealth, their armaments, this country, other countries, I don't care
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:43.500]   which you're thinking of, think of them all together, all national power, all human government
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:49.260]   is against God, it's the beast.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:54.420]   And it doesn't matter whether we belong to it or not, if it doesn't acknowledge God,
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.580]   it's under God's judgment.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.580]   And they're but as the small dust of the balance to him.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:08.460]   And they will all come to judgment, but I'm not only speaking about nations, I'm speaking
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.060]   about individuals, the same thing is true.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:16.460]   My friends, the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:21.860]   "Ah," says someone, "it's all very well to preach like that, people have been preaching
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.660]   like that for centuries, but the world has gone on."
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:29.500]   I know, Peter has already answered that objection, you remember, in that third chapter of his
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   second epistle.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:36.020]   He says, "Men don't understand this, that with God a thousand years are but as one day
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:41.460]   and one day as a thousand years."
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:47.460]   That's what makes preaching such a terrible thing, such a responsible thing.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:52.620]   And God forbid that I should do it unworthily or come between anybody and this message.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:58.780]   But the message is this, my friend, that you are face to face with God, and He will judge
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.260]   you by what He's told you in this book.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.020]   You were meant for Him, and you were meant to glorify Him, and if you don't, you are
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:13.860]   under the wrath of God, and a day will come when you'll know it.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.340]   Don't be deluded by the fact that so far things may have gone well with you.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.540]   As though you've turned your back against God and have laughed at Him and have gone
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.540]   your own way.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   You've done well.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   You've made money.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   Everything's going well.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.100]   Oh my dear friend, don't be a fool.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.780]   Don't take that ridiculous short view.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.060]   Read your Old Testament history and see yourself.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.660]   Judgment will come.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.380]   We've all got to meet Him and stand before Him.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.380]   Judgment.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.700]   And lastly, I thank God I can end with this.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.340]   The final thing we are told about God is His loving-kindness.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:55.860]   Whoso is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.940]   of the Lord.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:06.380]   Judgment first, yes; repentance first, obviously; John the Baptist first.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:11.660]   But thank God He's only the forerunner of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.100]   God is holy and righteous and just and pure.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:24.020]   His might, His majesty, His power are illimitable and He will judge the world in righteousness.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.420]   But thank God.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.180]   God is love also.
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:37.080]   God is full of loving-kindness and compassion and tender mercy.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.300]   And as we've seen in our four amazing pictures, when we are reduced to the end and are in
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:48.140]   our distress and are desperate and know not what to do in the storms of life, and we cry
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:55.380]   out unto Him, the answer is already there before we made our request.
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:02.300]   God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:08.380]   should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:14.600]   I have kept you with this aspect this evening because you cannot deal with the two sides
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.060]   in one sermon.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:22.460]   Next Sunday night, God willing, I hope to elaborate the other side and show this amazing
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.860]   loving-kindness of God.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.940]   But no man will ever know that until he realizes the truth about God.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.700]   People say to me, "I don't see any need for Christ."
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.420]   Why do you talk about the blood of Christ?
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.140]   They've never seen any need for it.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.140]   Why?
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.140]   They've never known what sin is.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.700]   They've never known God.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:44.380]   They have no conception of His glory, His holiness, His majesty, His righteousness.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.700]   They've never seen Him.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.340]   They've never seen themselves.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:54.380]   If they had, they'd be desperate, and they'd thank God for Christ.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:58.460]   Very well, we've looked at that aspect tonight.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:05.260]   We've been looking through this blessed revelation that God has been pleased to give us at God
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:09.660]   Himself and ourselves in the sight of God.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.300]   But there, I say, is a hope.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.460]   I may be preaching to somebody who will be dead before a week tonight.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.340]   It may be your last opportunity, so I don't let you go without saying this.
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:24.340]   My friend, if you have seen it, Christ has died for you, and your sins can be forgiven,
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:28.300]   and the moment you believe, they are.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:33.740]   The loving kindness of the Lord.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:39.700]   But if God spares me and spares you until next Sunday night, come back and I'll tell
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.580]   you something about that loving kindness.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:54.580]   The God who turns the rivers into a wilderness is the same God who can turn a wilderness
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.020]   into a spring, into a fountain.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:03.540]   That's the gospel in all its glory and its fullness.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:09.360]   My dear friend, do you know God?
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:14.460]   Do you know your relationship to God?
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.980]   It determines the character and the nature of your life in this world.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:27.920]   It determines whether in eternity you are going to enjoy everlasting bliss or eternal
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.340]   misery.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.900]   Amen.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
