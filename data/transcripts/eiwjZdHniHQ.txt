[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   - I have a question raised my hand, are you writing that?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.100]   Yes or no?
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.000]   - Mr. Bowles, I have a hard time calling you Jack for some reason,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.140]   but you're my financial hero, and in your book you talked about the irresponsibility
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.320]   of board of directors giving bonuses and paying the CEOs and managing the company
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.120]   to write in bankruptcy, why doesn't Vanguard withhold proving the board of directors
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.200]   and send the message out to the company?
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.400]   - Well, first of all, I can't speak for great expertise on that.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.000]   My understanding is there are some cases where we have withheld votes
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   for compensation from the investors.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.840]   How widespread that is, how ripe it is, my guess is it's not very much so.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.280]   And by so-and-so's grade, we didn't look as good about it as most of our competitors.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.360]   And I find that a little embarrassing, and somebody may find it a little absurd,
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.200]   and I don't know.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.160]   But that has to come, and there's a very, that's a funny...
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.560]   This has always been a funny mix of a perfection and a business.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.400]   And if Vanguard is going to hang, it showed it as far as I was able to.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.880]   The board, though that implementation may have been a monopoly, to get over to the
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.520]   professional side and out to the business side, you're always on the business side,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.160]   but minimized, and most companies in the industry are exactly the opposite,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.400]   go over to the business side and then out to the professional side.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.720]   It's all bringing in money, it's building assets under management,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.560]   it's making a lot of revenues.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   Most of these companies are publicly held.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.480]   The big companies are financial institutions, banks, insurance companies, and so on,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.960]   foreign and domestic.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   And they're in to make a return on their capital, not your capital.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.480]   So, of course, the governance either subtracts from that cause,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.160]   they offend clients, for example, or they vote on an issue that half their shareholders
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.200]   don't like, and it's in this controversy that we have here.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.720]   You know, the difference between winning and losing.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   A landslide is 55% of the spending, so let's be generous and say you get another
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   side of that, and you're taking 45% of your shareholders.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.360]   You just don't want to do that.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.200]   It's better to keep a low profile, stick your head up and get a shot off.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   And it's a controversial issue, so we can't do that.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.040]   So those weren't very satisfactory.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.480]   I always thought that the Vanguard, in large measure, I think,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.120]   got where we were at the beginning, through the beginning years,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.800]   of being outspoken and critical, you know, raising hell.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.040]   And I think a lot of people have denigrated that.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   They say, "Well, I was raising hell because I like to raise hell.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.920]   I do like to raise hell."
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.720]   But the fact of the matter is, when I was asked to comment on something,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.880]   I was always commenting on what a certain act meant, what a certain event meant,
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.160]   in terms of, was it a good or bad for mutual fund shareholders.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   And so when the press called, that's what I said, and when they called everybody
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.520]   else in the industry, they were thinking it was a good or bad for our company,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.080]   and it was going to make the stock go up, and make us more money or less money.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.920]   So they always could get a negative answer.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.720]   Now, if you look at those interests like this, they're just slamming into each other.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.240]   So I would hope, sooner rather than later, Vanguard would say, "Oh, damn it.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.400]   We're going to beâ€¦we're going to raise a lot of corporate dividends.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.040]   And we're going to put these proxy proposals in and say,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.760]   "No corporate dividends."
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.560]   And he knew, maybe he won't ask about that this evening,
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   but I know that they know how I feel.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.040]   And I should tell you, by the way, that a lot of my autographs go to him.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.640]   I don't think I've ever had a complaint when he said anything, I would imagine,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   about, quote, "Bernie, correct," about, you know, "Can't you stop saying things?"
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   And I heard him say that, you know, "I publicly disagree with Daniel."
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.720]   I don't think that's ever been the case.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   I say what I think, I don't know what the position is at all.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   I haven't seen him in a long time.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.320]   I don't know.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.920]   Do you know what I have to do about late shows?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.520]   He was always very well-prepared.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.920]   He always had his little, you know, the rest of us didn't,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   but he had his little telemarketer right there.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   You couldn't see it, but I could see it.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   And this was in the middle of, actually, a corporate governance thing.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   And I think we were talking, you know, he had a chair with a voice and everything like that.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   And, you know, Lou was a man who was well-read for that, in the papers.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   And he said, "Jack, I understand you disagree with Maynard on that point."
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   And I said, "No."
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   And he wasn't astonished.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   I mean, you should have seen the look on his face.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   And I paused a minute and said, "It's not that I disagree with him here.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920]   I disagree with Maynard.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   It's that Maynard disagrees with me."
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   [laughter]
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   And we've got three more questions, and the panel will stop laughing.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   [laughter]
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   Very exciting.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   But then, I mean, I know what our market world is.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   I know you can't give up on marketing.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   I believe deeply that we have to minimize doing things for marketing reasons.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   But you can't ignore them, because they're part of our world.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   And so, you know, it's fragile, it's flawed.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   But, you know, I guess sometimes you don't know.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   I think they're going to say they're doing something.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   And there's also a thing that I find difficult to deal with.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.920]   I guess they're working behind the scenes.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   Well, I'm sure they're talking truth.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   But if nothing's happening, maybe we should work in front of the scenes.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   I don't know.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   We have a question from a good friend of both of our, Mr. Taylor, who's with us in spirit.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   He says, "Dear Jack, could you please give us your thoughts about rebalancing portfolios?"
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   Okay, well, I'll say a couple of my thoughts about what I've heard.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   I don't have an uncritical answer about rebalancing portfolios.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   I do know that the facts say not rebalancing.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   Two things, the facts say it.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   Not rebalancing your portfolio is a better strategy than rebalancing.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   Simply because stocks have a higher momentum in the long run over your lifetime.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   And therefore, whenever you rebalance, you're going to have a higher yielding asset, a lower yielding asset.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   Not complicated.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   And so, that's what the data says.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   It also says something else, too, that's interesting.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   And that is, when rebalancing, when not rebalancing, loses rebalancing, and that would be errors.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   I mean, it does lose.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   The loss is pretty small, maybe a percentage point a year.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   Not systematic.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   And so, on the other hand, so then that says, don't bother.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   And I guess I'd say, for most investors, don't worry about that.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   If you feel like rebalancing, do it.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   It's not going to be devastating to you.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   It's intelligent to do it.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   It just may not be the best long-term strategy.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   But on the other hand, it may be a good short-term strategy.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   And again, every stock is different depending on what you do.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   And so, I'd say, if you want to rebalance, just follow a couple of rules.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   Don't do it very often.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   I mean, if you want to rebalance every month, I just don't know which rule to follow.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   That would usually be consumed by later 52% of stocks, or 49%, or 53%, or 44%.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   I don't know what stocks you want to go.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   Index, if you don't, or bond, if you don't.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   I don't know what to do.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   So, you know, maybe rebalance once a year.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   I would say only for the significant parts of it.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   If you want to be at 50-50, and you get it at the end of the year, 52-48.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   Honestly, I don't know if it's worth worrying about.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   On the other hand, corporate recruiting time, you want to be at 50-50,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   and you get up to 50-60, and you want to rebalance.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   Then rebalance on that basis.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   So, I don't have an easy answer.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   I think what will make investors feel better,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   maybe, will be those non-investment problems, behavioral problems.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   So, it's pretty much, as I mentioned, I don't do it.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   On the other hand, I rebalance.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   For me, in the last 15 years, bonds did about 67% a year.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   Stocks did, for 15 years, very hard.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   102% every three years, I don't know.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   And so, all of a sudden, I'm at 80 bonds.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   And I'm happy with that.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   Short intermediate duties.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   Short photobond market.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   Short invest in photobond.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   Short invest in my retirement budget.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   And so, it's kind of free to them all, I think.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   Okay, if you have a question, raise your hand.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   And then Jack will answer it.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   I'll be right back.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   Hi, Jack.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Great to see you so well.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   Thank you.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:38.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   I had a look at that chart.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   I'm sure you're right.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.920]   On the chart, I have like 59, 35, 27, 23.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   [Laughter]
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   I want to know what you do.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   Who do you consider you?
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   You're right.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   It's a free rider kind of thing.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   You make the company better.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   And you risk 98% of what you're doing.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   There's no easy answer to that.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   So one thing is it shouldn't be that expensive.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:53.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   So you have the resources to do it.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   But even more importantly, I'm trying to organize.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   This is a funny story.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   I tried to organize.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   I had this foundation for long-term investors.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   Coalition for long-term investors.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   Trying to get together.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.920]   To get together and do something together.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   So that was a attempt to fail.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   But what made it kind of amusing is this meeting came to this conclusion.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   Chris Davis is also in New York.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   So those are issues that I don't think is a cause of issue.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   Yes, sir.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   Do you have any comments about that right now?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   And that is certainly true.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.920]   Think about that.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   It's awful.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.920]   But it's vicious.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   It's nasty.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   It's self-serving.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.920]   And you can't get any more on it.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:12.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   I don't know.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920]   It's a bad system.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   It didn't used to be a bad system.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.920]   And so we need a lot of work there on the financial reform.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   I think I touched on it.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   And that is first, we don't really know how much progress we're making until we get the regulations.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   As you mentioned earlier in the day, that's a shield there.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   We're really going to be talking about banning capital requirements.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   And providing some capital for non-depositors who belong to your capital.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   Any of them.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   And if we get that done, it will have a huge impact on the financial system.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.920]   I just don't get that.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.920]   So we won't know how much the regulations get done.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   But of course, the lobbyists will probably have even more power.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:15.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   Really?
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   And so it remains to be seen.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.920]   I think the act probably is better than nothing.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   Not a lot.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   I would go a lot further.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   I would have gotten back side of the investment banking business.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   Bring back Glass-Steagall.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920]   I don't care.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.920]   Just use your common sense.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.920]   Jack, here's a question that was asked by a lot of foreign people.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   It's one of the most controversial discussions on this forum in the last year.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.920]   It's about Mr. Vogel's suggestion to include pensions and Social Security as part of the bond obligation.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.920]   It would be enlightening to have him elaborate on this.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.920]   This question could be illustrated with a simple example.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:12.920]   Should a 50-year-old with a $300,000 portfolio with 300,000 Social Security vendors be 100% bankers?
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   Okay.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   Let me say a couple things.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   One, I don't think they want to get into the 50-year-old.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   They may not want to get into the 62-year-old.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   Let's take the 62-year-old.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.920]   And the answer is statistically and arithmetically, if you want to be able to keep that people,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   and you're 62 years old, and you have a value in Social Security, as long as it's good and will be good,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.920]   because we're fixing Social Security.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   And eventually something has to happen.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   Nobody's going to let the thing go down.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   But let's consider Social Security for the purpose of money-making.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   He's going to pay you an extra turn year after year.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   It's amazing.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   I feel a little guilty about it, but I paid for it.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   I invested.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   So the idea of retirement to me is having not to spend an overwhelming amount of time on capital value,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   but to spend a lot of time on income.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   What income can be produced?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   That's why I like the event-paying spots.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   We have the biggest cut in dividends, 23% of the state.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   And the second biggest cut in the history of the index,
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.920]   going way back to giving back to where the S&P index existed.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   I think somebody takes those figures back.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   Maybe Bob Schiller.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   Maybe the guys at Yale.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   Back to 100 years, anyway.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   So, you know, an income stream.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.920]   And Social Security takes care of that.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   So, from an arithmetic standpoint, if you want to be 50/50,
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.920]   I see no reason you shouldn't be 50%.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.920]   100% stocks, 50% of your assets.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   100% stocks, therefore 50% of your total assets.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.920]   Now, it's not just an arithmetic matter.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   It's behavioral matter.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.920]   Because your stocks can add 57%.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.920]   And your income may not even be changed.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   But you're going to have to get out of stocks to do that.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.920]   [Indiscernible]
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   This is an interesting -- I don't have much work on it.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   I've got a lot of things I need to work on before I do this.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.920]   But why is it we think in terms of performance?
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.920]   Think of that, for example, there's going to be a balance fund.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.920]   There's going to be 50/50 in stocks and bonds.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.920]   So we have that fund that goes kind of like this.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.920]   And then we also have alternately 50% bond index fund,
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   50% stock index fund, two separate funds,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   where the performance is just the same.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   But it's not that the stocks are going to add anything.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   And one thing about your net demand curve is that you didn't get all of it here in a balance fund.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   You got all of it here in the stock account.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   So we have to fix these or at least ameliorate these behavioral problems.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.920]   But I don't think people are going to actually do that.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   I'm not sure I'd recommend doing it.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Because we have a lot of money for it to take.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   But I mean that one.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   I wouldn't say social security has a zero property for that.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   In fact, the way the question reads,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   I'm saying you should value security, social security, 100%.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   What do you think it's worth?
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   Let's say $300,000.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   Maybe you should say, well, social security is half of my net income.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   So you rebalance over 3/4 of the total.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   You have 50/50 on that.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   I think 65-70% of the stock.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   But there aren't easy answers.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   Particularly when you get to the major.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   But the math is clear.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.920]   And that is, if you want 50/50 social security or good corporate pensions,
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   it's very much the same thing.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   Although somebody's going to say, can you name a good corporate pension?
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   They're deeply in danger.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   We're also worried pretty much.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   And then they go into the [INAUDIBLE]
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   and you get half the income you expected.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   So our whole benefit system, our pension system is a mess.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   And so I say, think about that as a kind of a rule of thumb.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   And not something that, quote, "great" unquote says.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   Do this, do that.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.920]   No, you should do that.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   No, I don't think it works at all, really.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.920]   But do you think that you had mentioned several times about the dividends
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.920]   and the reduction in dividends.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   Couldn't that be attributed to the lower capital gains tax rate situation?
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   Couldn't that be attributed to the lower dividend distribution?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.920]   It shouldn't be.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   And it shouldn't be for maybe an obvious reason.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   And that is, most of the dividends would never get taxed.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920]   Think about that.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   70% of all money is managed by institutions.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   College endowments aren't taxed.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   State and local government pensions aren't taxed.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   Corporate pensions aren't taxed.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   So don't let that little bit of the brains overwhelm your common sense.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   It's a long exercise.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   I mean, I think the Lord, I quote, "Confess your name to the soul."
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   I'm not bragging.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   I think the Lord did do me a healthy amount of common sense.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   And it didn't do me a great brain.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   And it didn't do me a sophisticated brain.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   But the more I think about it, the more I'm just happy about my common sense.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   I look through conventional wisdom and say, "Why should that be?"
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   "What more do I need to know?"
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   "What's going on out there?"
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   "Not a lot of people sit."
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   "What's going on out there that isn't spoken or written about?"
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   "What do you mean by out of speech?"
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   "Why do you do that?"
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   And so it shouldn't be a big deterrent.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   And then you should also realize that the remainder of mutual funding is free.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   Not the 401(k), not the tax-deferred half.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   These funds are run--first of all, I don't want to get away with it.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   Tax-deferred investors is a crazy thing.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   And I don't want to hear from you tax-deferred investors about tax-deferred funds.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   And that's why, quote, "I have tax-managed funds."
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   And we did it in 1993, I think.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.920]   And it's the way to run money.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   You go to a trust officer somewhere who he's going to want to know,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   "Well, how much do you tax that?"
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   It gets into this 401(k).
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   It gets into gross costs versus income stocks.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   And so it shouldn't be a big deterrent.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   It's never taxed under any circumstance.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   And the fund managers run the remainder of the portfolio.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   They don't care about taxes.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   They get paid on pre-tax returns, not after-tax returns that you get.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   And so they're running those portfolios as if there's no difference.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   And then there's this.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   As those people--I don't read my Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   It's just a Wall Street outlet.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   Usually I don't have to worry much about taxes.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.920]   Because they're taking 4% of the dividend income themselves,
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.920]   consuming it.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   Consuming it before you get it.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.920]   So there's only 160% of it.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   There's not a hundred.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   And obviously they don't care at all.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   So when you put all that together, I don't think taxes are the reason.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   I think taxes on the dividend income are probably what throws you down the lane.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   But we'll see.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   We now have--you know, it's a funny question.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   It's sort of dumb.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   I don't do it.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   We now have a situation where, whatever you believe,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   if nothing happens by the end of the year,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.920]   taxes on the dividend income go up 39%.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   They do nothing.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   It's a good thing that some people want to do something about that.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   It's important.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   But I think probably Democrats would be willing to do it.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   Then you get no inheritance taxes, which I should say is a paradox.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   There's no profit in the inheritance tax.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   I think we should have.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   I do that a lot.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   When I was supporting Andrew Carnegie, he brought up inheritance taxes.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   When I was talking to him in Boston about counting religious values.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.920]   And Dan Gross talked about that.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   Andrew Carnegie wanted basically an inviscidory tax on the state.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   So it was a 90% tax.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   What good is it?
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   You're ruining children.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.920]   It's bad for society.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   And he'd done okay.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   But he left all the young people in libraries all over America.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   You can't go into a small town in America.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   Okay, what do you mean?
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   That's the only party you can operate in.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   He ended out.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   He got an egg in his rack to start.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   Did all kinds of useful things.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   Maybe there wasn't enough money left in the market to support it.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   But that's the kind of attitude that's pretty rare today.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   Mr. Gates, Sr. doesn't have much money.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   Mr. Gates, Jr. doesn't at all.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   And Warren Buffett.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   And I think David Rockefeller was in this group.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   And a few others.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   And the small way I am too.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   And we benefited from this great society.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   This great market.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   This great economy.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   This great country.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   Do we really own nothing?
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   Do we really own nothing?
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   Why?
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   Where will we be?
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   We've been born in America.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   We're supposed to be this country.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.920]   And someone told me that he didn't know himself.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   I said, I think that's wonderful.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   I don't need too many people.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   I'm a very successful person.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   And so are all successful people.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   My father is successful.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   And then I said, he said, I didn't know myself.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   And I said, I didn't know myself.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   How to arrange to be born in the United States of America.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   [laughter]
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   And that's the way I feel.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   I'm lucky to be here.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   I'm lucky to have the opportunity to pay insurance tax.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.920]   Related to that.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   Yes, sir.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   What are your thoughts on the future of the U.S. dollar and the federal debt?
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   And the impact on us as investors?
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   And is there high correlation?
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   There are some questions that are too big for me.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.920]   [laughter]
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   Believe it or not.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   You know, there are so many financial forces out there.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   And so many different opinions about what should happen.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   You know, the dollar is clearly weakening.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   We should be lightening it.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   Because we want the renminbi.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   We want the Chinese currency to be strengthening.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.920]   And, you know, you say we want a weak dollar.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   We have one at the moment.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   I guess the dollar came out here in the euro.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.920]   I think it was around $1.70 or $1.10.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   It came around to $1.15.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   It went up to about $1.60.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.920]   And then back to about $1.20.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   And now it's about $1.35 or $1.40.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   I'm not sure exactly.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   And I don't see how you can predict with anybody.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   It's hard to believe that a strong dollar, when we have a federal and state culture,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   that kind of fiscal mess that we have.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   You know, we're going to need to be doing a lot of work to get home on time.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   And I don't think that's consistent with a strong dollar.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   And I don't think anybody can do anything about it.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   I mean, just go out and have another meeting at the Plaza Hotel.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   James Avery was Secretary of the Treasury in probably 1998 or so.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   And then they seem to bring a little reality to the world market, currency markets.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.920]   But it's a very different economy.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.920]   We are not the strong hand in the world.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.920]   The Treasury is not the strong hand in the world.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.920]   We're weak financially.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   And eventually, we'll be weak in a lot of other ways.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:28.920]   So, you know, it must be obvious that you can only run so much debt so far
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   for the interest cost of the Treasury.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   And if I was in charge of the Treasury, man, right after I've been finance everything
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   for the next 30 years, creating 400%, that's going to seem like a bargain.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   So, I don't know if those interest rates happen a lot.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   And yet, the Chinese are basically the 11th.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   They own, I don't know, 2 trillion more debt.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   Debt's around 12 trillion.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   In China, I don't know if the brand number is 2 trillion.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   But it's a big number, certainly in the trading range.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.920]   And imagine those loans are going to go down if interest rates go up.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   So they're riding what they fell tiger to.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   So, you know, I wish I had the answers.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   I don't think even the great economists really have the answers.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   And, you know, it's very unpredictable.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   The actions of the nations are unpredictable.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   I wasn't surprised that the euro crisis didn't get even worse.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   And I think it might get worse again in Britain.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.920]   It's not going to go out in much better shape.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   Greece, some of it, but not a lot.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   Or Spain.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   What are they calling the pigs?
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   Portugal, Italy, Ireland.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   Where's Ireland?
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   Greece.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   And Spain.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   Aren't we great in acronyms?
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   Is this a great country or what?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   So I really don't know.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   I think you need to try and protect yourself.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   But the answer is by the table.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.920]   What would you do?
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   And I guess you go short.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.920]   Not short selling.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.920]   Short maturity.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   I don't believe in short selling.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   It might be a good idea.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   But I just think whatever.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   I don't know.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   I don't know any of the losses.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   And it doesn't intimidate.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   It's a timing strategy.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   And timing is what it is.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   And you know what you do consistently.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   So, you know, you go short.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.920]   You're worried about that kind of thing.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   You go into gold.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.920]   You get argument in commodities.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.920]   And I wish you well.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   But I wouldn't do it.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   I have to go buy some gold.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.920]   You know, just the ultimate protection.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   But I haven't done it.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   And I probably won't do it.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   I have to do other things.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   Okay.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.920]   Next question.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   When you lie down at night and you think about today,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.920]   do you ever spend time thinking about all the millions of people
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   that you have provided value to in terms of setting up Vanguard
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.920]   for the benefit of the investment?
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.920]   Do you ever think about that?
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   And if so, how does it make you feel?
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   Well, first of all, there's a classic.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   And that is that last thing I think about when I go to bed is when I finish
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   "The New York Times" while I sleep.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   [Laughter]
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   Do you do it in the evening?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   Yes, I do it in the evening.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   [Laughter]
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.920]   But I guess on Friday we kind of fight for the first four days.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   What do we do?
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   I have a daughter that's very good at it.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.920]   She won't be sitting here yet.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   Maybe beyond that.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   But I don't see a lot.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   I mean, I know what you think about that.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   I'm sorry to tell you.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.920]   There's too much in front of me.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   And I worry about what's behind me.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   People say you must appear to be very proud of your company.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   I'm very proud of it.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   I guess in a certain peculiar sense I am.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   I don't know.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   The idea that I think about a lot.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   I've just got too much on my mind.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   As you can see, I've got a much neater job that I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   [Laughter]
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   But, you know, there's this.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   I think it's always good to be looking out.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   Are we looking at new ideas?
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.920]   Are we concerned with the affairs of the world?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   Or will we stay at home?
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   I'm just going to tell you.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   That's kind of so chunky.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   I'm not even going to watch anything.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   Except for the police things.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.920]   [Laughter]
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   I don't know.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.920]   I guess it will be a time for introspection.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   And in some ways, some of the things you'll read in the new book are probably introspective.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   But I don't seem to use them.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.920]   I don't want to sell off my past.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.920]   And, you know, if I had a college name, Howard Einstein, let's say, which I'm not.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   I can see how he would be very proud of the theory of relativity.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   But I look at myself and I think, and what have I done that wasn't obvious?
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   And I can't come up with anything.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920]   [Laughter]
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   I can't come up with nothing.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.920]   And he was talking about this a lot, whether it was in an academic structure, tax-managed funds,
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   or whatever it might be, animals, all those things, just common sense.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   And I don't know how much applause you should get for using your head.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   It was pretty easy to guess it.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   In "The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism," you talk about the true cost of owning expensive funds.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   Am I right in understanding it that the expense ratio doesn't count?
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   Things like transaction costs and shelf space and bid-ask spreads and all those things there, they're not?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   You know, that's a good question.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   The question is whether you're buying on top of that cost of performance.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   And the points are also, we're all using the expense ratio, simple and short.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   And it wouldn't include any expense ratio.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.920]   If you're buying shelf space or facility, you're paying for it out of your management savings.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920]   And therefore, that isn't the expense ratio.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   And any management company spends is in the expense ratio.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   All your fund services are in the expense ratio.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:16.920]   What is not in the expense ratio are basically two things.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   Two additional costs, and actually we should be talking about three additional costs.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.920]   One is portfolio transaction costs.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   And since we don't know exactly what they are in this industry, I don't want to guess precisely what they are.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   But I use a rule of thumb about 1% of your turnover.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   So, turnover across you, you're 100% turnover across your 1% here.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   So, through a rule of thumb, maybe more like 3/4 of your 1%.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   If you turn over 50%, it'll be about 35 days, and once in 50 days, it'll be something like that.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   We don't know that.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   But I would use it.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   But I'd rather be generally right rather than precisely wrong.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.920]   And so, that's a big cost that's going on.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   And the other is sales charges.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   If they're in 12B, 1B, that will be in the expense ratio.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   But if they're not, because it's run in sales charges, and they're outside of that, then that will not be covered.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   And then, of course, taxes are not covered.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   And that's a huge thing.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.920]   You're going to be fined every day if you pay taxes.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   But you're going to run your money in tax evasion.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.920]   One of the single most important things you do.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   Tax evasion bank run.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   But it's all the same thing.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   Capture as much of the market return as you possibly can.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.920]   So, that's why I use a number about 2 to 2.5% of the overall cost.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   And in fact, the average equity run, yeah, the average unweighted equity run is about 1.4.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   But in fairness, what we're beginning to see as a whole is about 1% for unweighted run assets.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   But again, that comes vanguard.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.920]   We're getting big enough for 15% or 6 in the mutual fund industry.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   So, you know, all these averages you've got.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   Well, I'm going to prove your point.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   But I use a number about 2.5% and 2%.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   Easily better run than 1% and 2%.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   We'll take one more question over here, sir.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   It's an honor to ask you a question on a new book that I'm very much impressed with.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   You had talked about corporate governance in the United States.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   Essentially, you concurred that it was a bit of a mess.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   When one goes overseas to invest, it's probably somewhat worse than maybe the transparency of some developing nations.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   It's lousy.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   Having said all that, what do you see the role of institutions in the United States being?
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   I remember it as a vanguard in how we reduce the risk of those kinds of information failures in their investments?
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   You're talking about that abroad or here in the U.S.?
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   Sure. I mean, we have an engineering group.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   It's not a member of another agency.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   But it's trying to do a lot in improving governance abroad.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   As far as I know, no U.S. interest in that group because it takes a lot of work.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   They're just so short-term folks.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   They have to understand that governance matters nothing.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   Zero.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.920]   Daily fluctuation or monthly fluctuation or even yearly fluctuation.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   It just doesn't count.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   But it's everything.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   In the long run, the idea of governance is, to me, a very simple one.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   Is this corporation being run, a big corporation that does their own interests, isn't being run in the interest of shareholders?
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   That's what governance is about.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   So we should be saying, we vanguard with the mutual fund industry and with the institutional investment.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   We should be saying, we want to be damn sure that we come first for our executive pay,
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   for stacking the board with our friends, for getting in on mergers.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   If we think our company is bigger and I'm going to get paid more than they pay, I think 63% of those mergers do fail.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   We should be thinking more about what's the right amount of dividends to be given.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.920]   I've often said, this is about the governance issue generally, I don't see why we don't have higher dividends to pay
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   to institutional investors who've held the stock for over three years.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   So if the dividend is $2, give them $2.25, $2.20, $2.50, once you get to that volume period.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   And the dividends matter a lot in institutional decisions.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.920]   Not as much as they should in the fund industry, because we consume so much of them.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   We don't want to talk about dividends.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   In the ICF I have never, if I said it, never even hinted on the idea that such a thing as a dividend is a percentage of the income.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   Expenses is a percentage of the dividend income.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.920]   And I didn't get any nice letters from them.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   And I didn't get any nice letters from Mr. Hans either.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   Well, I hate that kind of street fighting stuff.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   The only letter I really love is 105%.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   I probably also have some of these out there.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   And I should tell you this, sort of anecdotally, I didn't know it was going to write the letter,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   but I talked to the manager of the op-ed.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   I talked to him every week for about an hour on Friday morning.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   And he said, I love your op-ed.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   And actually, I agreed with 75% of it.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   And I said, which I was standing in line with him for, I said, you know, that's great.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   You're more than 75%.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   I'm going to feel like I haven't done my job.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   So, but then I see things.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   He said he wasn't talking about his company.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   He was talking about the industry.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   He better believe he wasn't talking about his company.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.920]   And that big fund got huge.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   It had a high performance record.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.920]   And four years since, five years since, it's in the 100th percentile.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   It's the first performing fund in the entire category.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   So I guess it's not a big fund.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   And, you know, it's very boring to be in the throat for a title five years in a row.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   [Laughter]
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   It really is.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   If you tried to be there, I guarantee you, you could not get there.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   And what would you do?
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   And someone said, I think it was Michael Ransom, works at Apple, good guy, very analytical,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.920]   said there was a piece on skill versus luck.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   And he said one of the differences is if you decide you want to fail, if it's all luck,
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   you can't do it.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   Right?
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   If it's all skill, it's pretty easy to fail.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.920]   You know, that heart surgeon who put my new pump in, he wanted to fail.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   I can't tell you how easy it would have been.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.920]   [Laughter]
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   But if you want to fail in the investment business, it's just as difficult, really,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   when you think about it, it's just as difficult to fail as to succeed, except you make the
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   failure easier because of all your costs.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   And then that turns out to be the differentiator.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.920]   So I don't know.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   I want skill.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.920]   And there's some.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   And skill and luck, you can't have a good fund director without skill and luck.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   A lot of students in the economy, when you think about Bill Miller, everybody's here,
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.920]   all that good money manager, nothing to do with Bill Miller.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   But he was at the bottom of the day.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   He was working 5 to 70 years in a row, and then was 100% at the bottom three, just after
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   all the money came in.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   I mean, it's a vicious business.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   It's a hard business.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   And I respect money managers who are trying to do a good, honest job, because it is such
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   a hard business.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   And I know that, and I respect them for trying, but they're going to do that by investing
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   in the wrong people.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.920]   OK, we're going to have anybody go to the locker room.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   Before we do, Jack, go ahead.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.920]   We got him.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   [INAUDIBLE]

[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.920]   I'd like to give you this memento of this occasion, Jack.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   And Mr. William Dow, I wonder if you all synchronized Philadelphia, synchronized Derby,
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   synchronized Freedman.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   And of course, our investment being out here in Philadelphia, and your nice work has liberated
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   millions and millions of investors from high cost, and given us [INAUDIBLE]
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   And we all thank you so much for that.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   I'd like to read the inscription that says, "To Jack Vogel, our friend and mentor,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   over your vocal heads."
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   Philadelphia, 2010.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   Thank you.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   Thank you all.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   A little bit of ringing already cracked the bell.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]

[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   Yeah, well, that hangs right above a painting of the American flag that I have,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   or at least a very nice one, has come to be written right on the flag.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   And that's over at my fireplace.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   And so we'll put this right in the mail.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   I love that.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   And I thank you all very, very much.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   [APPLAUSE]
