[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   All right, so we have another question here speaking of careers. This one is from Jeff.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.080]   Jeff says, "Hi Cal, earlier this year, you were talking about how the principles of your book,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.920]   'So Good They Can't Ignore You,' don't really apply to lawyers because the more career capital they
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.280]   get, the more work they get, which leads to less freedom and less autonomy. My question is,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.560]   what should we lawyers in the audience do?" And he goes on to say that he is a six-year associate.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.160]   Well, Jeff, what you can do is leave the big law firm job.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.320]   And not to be stark about it, but career capital theory is pretty clear.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.440]   You build leverage by doing rare and valuable things, but that's only really useful if you
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.520]   can then apply that leverage to shape your career towards things that resonate and away from things
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.560]   that don't. Big city law firm jobs where you work your way up the associate ladder, you're a six-year
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.080]   associate, which means you're about to go up for partnership. And then after partnership, you go
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.720]   up for equity partnership. And then you work up a ladder of equity partnership until the very
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   highest you could possibly get is named a partner. And the money goes up with each of those levels.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.160]   And the money is good if you're in DC, let's say, big city with one of these big firms.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.280]   These numbers really vary, but we're talking about you're starting as a younger associate,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.520]   you're already at $300,000 or $400,000 a year. As a junior partner, you're probably talking
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.880]   six, $700,000. Equity partner, you're going to break at a big firm, like a Skaggan,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.600]   you're going to break a Wilmer, you'll break seven figures. And then these more senior equity
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.160]   partners at a big city, the big firm, one five, one six, something like that. So you make a lot
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.920]   of money, but it's incredibly time demanding. And it demands more and more of your time.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.000]   There's almost nothing you can invest your career capital in other than getting more money
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and maybe some influence on what your practice is. You can kind of carve out your own practices,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560]   but you're not going to get more autonomy. The other buckets, the non-craft buckets of the deep
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.760]   life, you're going to have a really hard time doing much of anything in any of those buckets,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.440]   if you're going to work up that ladder. Now, for some, I don't know, they value the money,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.080]   they value the prestige. For some, it's this money is going to allow a lifestyle that's good for my,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.240]   the rest of my family, and that's my contribution. And that's fine. But if it's not fine for you,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.160]   if you feel overwhelmed by work, if it's stressing you out, it's making you anxious,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.000]   you feel hemmed in, you feel miserable. And a lot of lawyers do in those situations.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.040]   The answer is to leave the big law firm, do something else with your law degree,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.480]   and it'll be a lot less money. But so what? I don't know what's the good of the one six,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.160]   if you only have six hours a week that you're seeing your family. So I usually am pretty radical
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.280]   about that. You have to go into a big firm law career with your eyes open. This is what it's
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.640]   going to be, and it's not going to get better. And so many people stumble into it because it's just,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.000]   this is the next step up. This is more prestigious than this. And it's not that there's not value in
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.880]   doing something competitive. There is. And it's not that it will make you feel better because it
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.760]   does. And it's not that you don't get pride out of having such a hard elite job. You should. It's
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.680]   very difficult to give you someone to pay you seven figures for anything, right? That's hard to
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.960]   do. And there is some pride there. But if it is making you miserable, there's no way, there's no
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.480]   way to reconfigure your job at a big law firm that's going to get rid of that misery. So I
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   just like to put that option on the table of the proverbial big city lawyers. Know what you're
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.000]   getting into. And if that's not working, I can't give you a way out that's going to preserve that
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.920]   salary, that's going to preserve the house in Chevy Chase and the private school in the second
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.600]   house on the beach. I can't give you a way out that's going to preserve all of that. It's going
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.320]   to be a pretty radical lifestyle change, a different type of law, something your own firm,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.200]   something that you can control how many clients you take on or off. And that's basically what
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.720]   you're going to have to do, Jeff. So look, this is probably the time to think about that before
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.440]   you go up for partnership. I hope I'm not the bearer of bad news, but I just think it's important
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   to be clear. This is the reality of that job. And let's not pretend like it's not, or like it's
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.160]   going to be different somehow, different somehow for you. You know, Jesse, I went down. The reason
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.280]   why I had those salary numbers on hand is for some reason I went down a rabbit hole of lawyer
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.320]   compensation. Because I know a lot of lawyers who are very stressed out and I was trying to
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.160]   compare. I was like, well, how much like do I make as a writer versus what they're doing and how much
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.920]   more flexible is my job? And I went down this rabbit hole and you can like find a lot of these
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.680]   numbers. It's a big topic of discussion in the DC area. But I never know how people think about
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.520]   those jobs. Like when you hear those numbers, those salary numbers, did that surprise you as
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.920]   more than you thought, less than you thought, or about what you would have thought lawyers were
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.920]   making around here? - About what I thought, I would say. - I find that people who live in the
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   cities, like, yeah, that's what I'd expect. And people who don't, like, what? You get a million
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.560]   dollars a year to be a junior equity partner? What is that? - Yeah. It's also a weird perspective
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.160]   for me. Cause I have a couple, like a few, like really good friends who kill it on the internet.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.440]   So then I, you know, when I see those numbers, I mean, I'm nothing like any of that, but I see
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.560]   those numbers and I'm like, that's nothing, you know? - Here's the hierarchy, the elite job,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:35.280]   the elite job hierarchy in terms of salaries, right? So you have lawyers and like investment
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.320]   bankers, lawyers at big firms and investment bankers for firms like Goldman, right? So
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.920]   lawyers, you can, you hit seven figures when you get to the partner level, again, big firm,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.240]   big company. If you're at something like Goldman Sachs, when you get to the managing director
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.960]   level, you're going to hit seven figures plus with bonuses, right? So that's in the elite jobs,
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   actually, this is going to be at the bottom of our platform. Then the next thing you have above that
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   is, all right, so then the more elite jobs are, I'm trying to see how I order this. I guess I
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.400]   would order it next, maybe like venture capitalists. If you had a really big venture capital firm,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.080]   where you can get a cut of the returns, now you can jump above that low seven figures and get that
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.720]   good, healthy mid seven figure type payouts. And then you have this big leap where you get to the
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.320]   tech sector, like your friends, and then the tech sector, because you can have businesses that are
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.200]   bought, that's where you start to get eight figure or low nine figure paydays. So now it's okay,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.560]   I've started a tech company and I netted 30 million in the sale. So now we're at that eight
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.400]   figure level. And then the people who lord over it all is the hedge fund managers. Because now
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:58.160]   when you're a hedge fund manager, they laugh at everyone else because they can do eight or nine
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.240]   figure income every single year, because they're getting their carry cost of these really big
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   hedge funds. And so then they look at the tech people and say, look, you're laughing at the
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.280]   Goldman guy who makes one five a year because you sold your company for 30 million. But that took
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.760]   you five years to sell your company for 30 million. And I pull in 150 million a year, every
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.520]   year for my hedge fund. And then the very top hedge fund people will bring in a billion dollars a year
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:31.040]   plus. So there's your hierarchy of like crazy amounts of money that elite jobs. Notice nowhere
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   in that hierarchy that I say author podcasters, we don't land on that hierarchy, unfortunately.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.000]   Professor podcasters don't land on that hierarchy. But that's a whole interesting world,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.120]   like the super big money job world. CEOs are in there too. CEOs of big companies land where the
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:59.600]   tech people are, seven, eight figure salaries. So- Have you seen the new show on Showtime,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.760]   super pumped I read the book. It's about- Is this on Uber?
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.640]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:12.240]   It's about Travis Kalanick. There's a episode two just was released this week. And there's a good
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.480]   scene in there where the VC brings him to the airfield where there's all the private jets.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.560]   And he's like, what do you need to say to me? He goes, are we going somewhere? And then he was like,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.000]   so-and-so. And then Travis is pretty brash, pretty confident guy. And he was like,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.520]   I started, he had a couple of lines about like Elon Musk and Bezos and stuff, like owning like
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.800]   40 of those planes and like, what do you really want to do?
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.320]   What I really want to do is own all of those planes.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.760]   Not go on net jets. Yeah.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.400]   Oh my God. Yeah. We're getting there. We have a couple more steps before we're buying the
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   Deep Questions private plane. So we are- You got to get it before the 200th episode
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.440]   so we can go to South Africa. To go to that, yeah. For that main
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.920]   episode. Yeah. So we're almost there. We want to get like a boom arm for our computer monitor
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.360]   so we can move it. So that's first. I want to get longer cables for our video switcher so that
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   when we have guests, we can bring the video switcher so you can switch video for us. That's
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.440]   two. So boom arm for the computer monitor. That's number one. Longer cables for the video switcher.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.720]   That's number two. Private jet. That's number three. Number four, I'm thinking we should have
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:32.320]   our own coffee maker because we buy a lot of coffee. And so those are the things we're working
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.040]   on. I think with that sweet workable money and grammarly money, we'll have that private jet
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.480]   right after we get those longer cables. That's depressing thinking about big money people.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.800]   But I got to say, those people must all be incredibly stressed out. That's all stressed
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:54.160]   out. I think the sweet spot I still think is genre novelist. So you produce one thing a year,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.920]   but you don't have to win book. It doesn't have to be literature because there's too much stress
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.440]   if you're a literary novelist because you live and die by the reviews. But no, you're writing like
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.080]   a Jack Reacher book. It doesn't have to be literature. You have your formula, one book a
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.640]   year. No one expects you to do anything else. Lee Child doesn't have a big social media presence.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.280]   He doesn't podcast. You just have to write a book. They don't expect you to do anything else
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.000]   because people are just used to buying your book. You make a good amount of money. Like Lee Child,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.320]   he bought the apartment above their apartment for writing. So he could get there pretty quickly.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.680]   But it's not Travis was his name money. He's not flying around in private jets. But they have a
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.840]   writing house by the beach and very little is expected from them. That's the sweet spot. You
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.080]   have a lot of money, but not a crazy amount of money. But it's the money to anxiety ratio. I
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.680]   think that's got to be the, if we put the other way, anxiety to the money ratio. That must be
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.440]   the lowest anxiety to the money ratio you can find, in my opinion, is successful genre novelist
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.920]   that produces one novel a year in a successful series. That's the sweet spot. Like it. Yeah.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.520]   So I got to start writing. So I'm going to announce my new detective series about a suave
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:12.160]   computer scientist who by day solves theorems and by night fights international terrorist rings.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.720]   Well, you know, fighting off the women who fall in love with them. And then when you do the audio
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.800]   version, you need to have some character in there with the voice that you used last week. That was
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.040]   classic. And that French character. Yeah. That French character will be in there. We got a note
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.920]   from Tim Ferriss, his chief of staff, who runs all this podcast. And he sent us a note saying
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.320]   that he really appreciated the accent. Oh, it was great. I was dying. So that character will be in
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.560]   there. And the character will obviously be me. We'll call him Kevin Newhouse, but it'll clearly
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   be me, but I'm going to have David Goggins voice him. So he's going to have this really aggressive,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.600]   deep, awesome voice. And the audio books are going to have a lot of musical interludes,
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.720]   like action musical interludes while I fight. And then I'll buy the house next to mine to
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:07.360]   be a writing house. And well, there we go. So it's all mapped out.
