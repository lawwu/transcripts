[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.280]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.760]   This is a special edition of the show. This show was pre-recorded so that it would be here for you
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.200]   while I am traveling here at the end of the month of September. If this is your first time listening
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   to the show, feel free to enjoy today's content, but please check the archives prior to September
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.040]   15th or check back after October to see the more normal ebb and flow of the show. I hope you'll
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.000]   uh I hope you'll enjoy the content. Today I want to share with you very briefly about a concept
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.240]   that I think is under discussed and this is a concept of investing in your health.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.040]   Now it should be immediately intuitive what I mean by investing in your health,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.320]   but oftentimes we don't talk about this subject or at least we don't face it head on.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.440]   I have often said with clients within the context of the sale of insurance, especially as regards
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240]   disability insurance, that people will spend all of their health trying to gain wealth and then
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.680]   they'll happily spend every dollar they have to try to get their health back again. It's true,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.560]   isn't it? People will spend all of their health trying to gain wealth and then they'll happily
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.680]   spend every dollar they have to try to get their health back. That's your health. What do you have?
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.880]   Now, fortunately many of us are blessed with having good health, but many of us,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.280]   myself included, don't value it as highly as we value as we should value it.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.400]   What would you what amount of money would you require me to pay you to give up your good health?
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.200]   What amount of money would you require me to pay you to cause you to be bedridden?
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.560]   Bedridden for the rest of your life. Or what amount of money would you
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.080]   require me to pay you to give up an arm, a leg? You should get the idea. For most of us,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.640]   that number is zero, meaning you're not willing to give it up for any amount of money.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.720]   If that's the case, why do we not value our health more and why do we not invest in our health?
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.320]   I propose to you that investing in your health and valuing your health is one of the best
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.760]   investments that you can make. The good thing is, is it probably doesn't cost that much.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   Now, I don't know what your path should be or what you should do to invest in your health.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.920]   For some of you, it may mean making better choices with the food that you buy. For some of you,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.840]   it may mean working less. For some of you, it may mean changing to a career that is
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.960]   less likely to result in the destruction of your health.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   You have to decide what it means for you. But consider, are you willing to sacrifice your health
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.400]   for wealth? You could take away every dollar I have, and if I have my health, man, I could have
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.080]   a great life. I really could. I could be very comfortable living under a bridge in Miami,
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.760]   Florida and spending every day on South Beach. I could be very comfortable just simply asking a few
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.880]   people to share some food with me. I could be very comfortable walking across the world with no money
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.840]   and figuring it out as I go if I have my health. If I have my health, I could be very comfortable
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.920]   by getting a job, rebuilding my base of capital, starting businesses. All of that is predicated
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.160]   based upon health. And again, this is not an insurance discussion today, although this is a
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.440]   very important concept, and it's the reason why we buy insurance, especially disability income
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.040]   insurance. So just consider, is there something that you could do today to invest in your health?
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.600]   Or is there something that you could do today to invest in your health? Or is there something that
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.200]   you could stop doing today to invest in your health? I don't know what it is for you,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.720]   but I encourage you to consider the concept. That's it for today. Be back with you tomorrow.
