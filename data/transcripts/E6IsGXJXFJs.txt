[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220]   Recently you were in town for the National Conference, Pastor John, and
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.880]   while you were here you mentioned to some of us your thoughts on why you
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.000]   think God banned Adam and Eve from eating from one tree. Explain this for us
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.120]   here now on the Ask Pastor John podcast. What theological significance do
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.280]   you draw from the prohibition in the Garden of Eden?
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:34.240]   Well I remember standing last week, Tony, in your office and saying the tree is a
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.280]   way of securing that the pleasures of all the other trees in the garden are
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.840]   supremely pleasures in God. The function of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.920]   evil is to make sure that the pleasures of all the other trees in the garden
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.000]   that those pleasures are supremely pleasures in God. So let me try to
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.440]   unpack that and explain how that is. The command not to eat went like this, "You
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.120]   may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but the tree of the knowledge of
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.840]   good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   surely die." So what was God saying in prohibiting the eating of one tree out
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.560]   of a million trees? He was saying, "I've given you life, I've given you a world
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600]   full of pleasure, pleasures of taste and sight and sound and smell and feel and
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.720]   nourishment. Only one tree is forbidden to you." And the point of that prohibition
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.760]   is to preserve the pleasures of the world. Because if you eat of that one,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.700]   you'll be saying to me, "I'm smarter than you are, I'm more authoritative than you
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   are, I'm wiser than you are, I think I can care for myself better than you care for
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.400]   me, you're not a very good father and so I'm going to reject you." And that's what
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.120]   you'll be saying. So don't eat from the tree because you'll be rejecting me and
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.720]   all my good gifts and all my wisdom and all my care. Instead keep on
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.420]   submitting to my will, keep on affirming my wisdom, keep on being thankful for my
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.080]   generosity, keep on trusting me as a father and keep on eating these trees
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   as a way of enjoying me. There are 10,000 trees, every imaginable fruit, just go eat,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.960]   be thankful, I've given them to you and see them as expressions of my goodness
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.320]   and savor them that way. And Satan comes along and he takes that arrangement and
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.160]   he says, "Hey Eve, the meaning of that arrangement is God is selfish, God is
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.000]   stingy, he's a skin flint." And so he took the prohibition of one suicidal tree and
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.880]   treated it as a prohibition of everything. So the issue of the tree is,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.480]   will we keep looking to God as the giver and lover and treasure of this garden so
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.000]   that all our eating is thanking and all our savoring is a savoring of God? Will
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.360]   we keep on experiencing every one of these tastes as a tasting of something
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.760]   like what God is? And in that sense, a tasting of God, will we keep on enjoying
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.600]   God in the enjoying of the trees? That's what the forbidden tree was there to
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.640]   test. It wasn't—I think a lot of people try to set it up as merely arbitrary.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   This is simply, "Will man obey or will he not obey?" And then they don't put it in
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.360]   the context of his fatherly care and all the goods that he's given, just—I don't
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.720]   think it's arbitrary like that. It was a warning. If you choose independence
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.800]   instead of God-dependence, you will lose the pleasure of the garden and God with
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.120]   it. If you keep trusting me and enjoying me as your greatest delight and highest
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.920]   treasure, you will have this garden and I will be the pleasure of all your
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.920]   pleasures. So that's what I meant, Tony, when I was standing there and I
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.560]   said this tree is a way of securing that the pleasures of all the other trees in
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.760]   the garden are supremely pleasures in God. Hmm, that is a fascinating connection.
