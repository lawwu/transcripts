[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Well, welcome to our final Q&A session.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   And this time we don't have a theme, which means I can ask anything I want.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.500]   And some of you have stopped me in the hallway this morning and given me suggested questions,
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800]   not bad questions either.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.720]   So I want to start by asking a question about your influences, John.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.360]   Two pastors that I've had in my lifetime were you and Warren Wiersbe, and both of you are
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.340]   expositors, different kinds of expositors, but you both had a major influence on me.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.980]   And my two best friends in college were also fanatically supportive of the idea of expository
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.980]   preaching.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.100]   It was Steve Kraloff who was here this week and Doug Heck who died last year.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.660]   Doug was the one who got me started memorizing Scripture.
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.620]   And Steve was the one who gave me my first John MacArthur tapes.
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.260]   And then you've been a profound influence on me.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.700]   My question is, what are the major influences on you?
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.660]   And because when you began doing verse-by-verse preaching, there weren't a lot of examples
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.660]   of that.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.440]   There weren't people lobbying for expository preaching.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.420]   What convinced you that that's the way to go?
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.600]   Well, my dad's, of course, the greatest speaker.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.200]   Greatest influence in my life.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.880]   He was born into a pastor's family, so I heard him for most of my young life.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.360]   And we were very close until he died at the age of 91.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.540]   So the early years of his ministry, he was more of an evangelist.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.020]   In fact, he was an evangelist for the Fuller Foundation in Los Angeles, and he was an evangelist
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.540]   with the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540]   Did a lot of citywide meetings.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.540]   He was a pastor.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.540]   He was an evangelist.
