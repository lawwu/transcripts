[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   Here's a sensitive question we get not infrequently in the inbox and this time it comes from a nameless female listener who simply asks this
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.980]   Pastor John is it a sin to be pregnant before marriage?
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.360]   And pastor John, how do you go about answering such a sensitive question?
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.520]   one way to
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   reframe this question
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.840]   Would be to ask are the effects of sin
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.880]   sin
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.360]   But when I when I thought that I thought no
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.820]   even that's not precise enough is it because
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.960]   Pregnancy before or outside of a marriage covenant
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.680]   may be owing to a woman's
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.840]   sin or
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.280]   may be owing to being sinned against like rape or
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.640]   both
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.280]   like if she
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.960]   Engaged willingly and he engaged willingly. They're both
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.680]   sinning she's being sinned against by a man who should take better care of her and she's sinning by
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.080]   Willingly participating but Paul says in in first Corinthians 618
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.680]   flee
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.240]   from sexual immorality the old translation
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.180]   fornication and we know from first Corinthians 7 - he's talking about
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.960]   extra
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   marital sexual
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.360]   relations
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   because he says
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.640]   because of the temptation to sexual immorality
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.440]   Each man should have his own wife and each woman her own
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.920]   Husband in other words sexual relations belong
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.000]   only in the safe
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.760]   holy
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.120]   beautiful
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.880]   Sanctuary of a marriage covenant between one man one woman while they both live
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.520]   So the the presence of a child in the womb
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.920]   Outside marriage is either the result of being sinned against in
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.120]   rape or
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.760]   the result of
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.160]   sinning
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760]   Now back back to that original reframed question
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.800]   Assuming that this new mother of this unborn child did sin in
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   having sexual relations outside
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.000]   The marriage covenant is the presence of this child in her womb
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Sinful is pregnancy or the child sin she asks
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.120]   The answer is no and let me surround that no
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.800]   with three observations
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.440]   to give some seriousness and
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.200]   Christ centered hope
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.080]   to this mother with an unplanned
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.560]   Pregnancy or to whoever else may be listening that way
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.760]   observation number one
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.040]   That there would be a stigma
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   That attaches to pregnancy outside marriage is I think a good thing
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   We have almost entirely lost it today
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.840]   because of the normalization of sexual immorality and
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.560]   Because of putting people's feelings above a call to holiness
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.760]   But having said that it is crucial that every Christian and every church
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.800]   Make clear that any stigma that attaches to pregnancy outside marriage is because the pregnancy
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.080]   signifies
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.520]   previous sin not because the pregnancy is
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.960]   Sin, and if there has been no previous sin say in the case of rape that should be handled
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.680]   really delicately and tenderly but
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.440]   Not I think in the church merely
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   privately
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   So I say again
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.600]   appropriate stigma
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.800]   attaches to a previous sin as its
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   basis and to a present pregnancy only as a possible pointer to
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.480]   That sin and the reason that's important and hopeful hopeful
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.960]   Is is what follows in my second observation?
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.720]   Here's a second observation the second thing to say is that a woman's experience of shame
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.760]   Should also only attach to the previous sin not the present pregnancy
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.440]   one of the reasons for that for for that is because
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.280]   Sin can be forgiven because of Christ a woman can confess
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.120]   That sin and be cleansed of it so that the shame is overcome and taken away
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.240]   by the merciful cleansing grace of
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   God
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.720]   If if the shame attaches to the pregnancy or the child itself, then there's no overcoming
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.600]   in other words the solution to both the stigma and the shame is
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.640]   in the preciousness of the forgiveness of Christ and the forgiveness of a humble community of saved sinners and
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.000]   All of that assumes that the basis of the stigma and the shame the basis of both
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.240]   attach
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.880]   To the proper place namely the previous sin not the present pregnancy
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.480]   And here's the third observation
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.440]   Sovereign grace a sovereignty of God makes it possible
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.640]   For both a pregnancy and a child
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.240]   That is the woman's experience and the child's experience
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.760]   To be turned for good in the life of the woman and the child and the family and the church and the world
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.080]   No one needs to feel no woman needs to feel no family needs to feel
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.880]   That because the child originated in a sinful act if it did
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.680]   God
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   Cannot make this child great
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.520]   He can't
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   So I hope what our nameless friend feels is that it is wise and good
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.440]   to be serious and sober and honest about the stigma and the
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   shame of the sin of sexual immorality
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.200]   if that's the case and
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.800]   That the remedy for that sin and the hope
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.480]   for a life of freedom and joy and peace and usefulness
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:55.880]   For mother and child and family and everybody affected should not be sought in the minimization of sin
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.320]   but in the maximization of
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.400]   God's grace
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   This grace is very very
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.440]   Great your pregnancy is not a sin the sin that brought the pregnancy
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   If it did is no less
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.760]   forgivable
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.640]   Than my sins or the sins of those in your church your experience of that forgiveness
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:29.000]   through repentance and faith in Jesus can become a mighty testimony to the beauty of Christ and
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   That child can grow up in the beauty of Christ and become great
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:45.000]   Magnificent word pastor John pastor Ali is sensitive and biblically careful. Thank you very much for your time on Friday
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.120]   We're gonna close out the week hearing from a listener who wants to know whether or not in heaven. We will fear God
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:58.760]   Will we fear God in heaven? And if we do fear God in eternity, what does that mean for our joy and delight in him?
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.760]   It's a really good question
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.360]   This is somewhat complicated question
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.920]   But it's on the docket for Friday
