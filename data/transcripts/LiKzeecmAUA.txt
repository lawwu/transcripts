[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   Let's talk about breakups, business breakups, romantic breakups.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   Right.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.720]   You're breaking up with me?
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.160]   No, no.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.640]   But thanks for the hypothesis test.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.840]   No, in fact, in fact, I'm enjoying this conversation so much, as I always do, I'm learning a ton
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.000]   from you, that if anything, I'd like to expand and deepen our relationship, Chris.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.200]   There, you got a lot of knowledge out of me.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.760]   Platonic and professional, but expansive.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.920]   What is the process of ending a relationship, and again, this could be romantic relationship,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.760]   could be business relationship, could be employer-employee, could be individuals, could be telling a
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.640]   whole group, or an entire group telling an individual.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.080]   You know, the reason I raise this as a particular example is that I'm assuming that both sides
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.780]   don't want the same thing.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.240]   One side wants to continue, the other side wants to end.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.200]   I'll avoid the use of the word win-win, or the words win-win, excuse me, and just ask,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   is there a way to have that conversation in any of the contexts I just mentioned, in a,
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.760]   as you so beautifully described it, a straight shooter manner where it's direct, it's honest,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   but it lands soft?
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.440]   Because what we're talking about here is feelings of rejection, and nobody likes feeling rejected.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.640]   I don't know anybody that likes being fired, even from jobs they don't like.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.540]   People's egos suffer.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.060]   So is there maybe a more specific way of asking the question is, is there a way to encourage
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.500]   the person getting the bad news, to get their ego out of the way and see that if both parties
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.920]   don't want it, it's best for everybody involved?
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.160]   I almost want to say no, but first, what are the caveats?
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.600]   Most of the time when people are struggling with this, they're not trying to save the
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.400]   other side, they're trying to save themselves.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.000]   So who are you really trying to save?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.160]   By postponing it, softening it, trying to act like it's something that it's not.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.240]   I don't know that anybody has ever been fired that didn't have a sense that it was coming.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.160]   The person that was getting ready to fire them opens up by saying, how are you?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.060]   They know how the other person is, and a person getting ready to get fired has got some gut
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.820]   instinct that things are going wrong.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.760]   Like you said, the gut's very powerful.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.240]   So you got to lower the boom as quickly as you can, but also as gently as you can.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.880]   I was involved in a nonprofit a number of years ago affiliated with a church, and we're
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.240]   struggling with whether or not to let the executive director go, I go to the minister
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.960]   of the church, Norman Vincent Peale's protege, a guy named Arthur Caliandro, one of the best
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.600]   human beings I've ever met in my life, phenomenal guy.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.560]   And I'm struggling with, I thought firing, letting this woman go was going to be bad.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.420]   And I thought Arthur was going to counsel me a way out.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.040]   And he looked at me and he said, you know, there's no gentle way to cut somebody's head
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   off.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   And I thought, yeah, the humane thing here is how do you bring it to conclusion as quickly
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.560]   as possible, because there's no humane way to cut somebody's head off.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   There's no humane way to terminate the relationship.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920]   Now what are the caveats?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   Maybe there are.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.200]   First caveat, if you're going to fire somebody, never fire somebody on a Friday, fire them
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   on a Monday.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.040]   Fire them on a Monday, they got a work week to work their way out of it.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.280]   You fire them on a Friday, they got a weekend to be miserable and to feel horrible, and
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.480]   they can't do anything about it.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.760]   Caught off guard or not, on a Monday, they can pick themselves up, they can start looking
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.560]   for a new job, no matter who you are.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.640]   Fire them on a Friday, they can't start looking for a new job on a Saturday, it's two days
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   of misery.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.920]   Yeah, if you're going to fire somebody, fire them on a Monday, not on a Friday.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.420]   If you got bad news to give somebody, warn them it's coming.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:30.200]   People are ridiculously resilient to pain if warned, and then that you lower the boom.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   You're not going to like what I have to say, it's going to be heartbreaking, you're going
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.480]   to hate me.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:43.680]   Dictate no more than three seconds, they got their guard up, let them have the bad news.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.480]   That's the humane way to cut somebody's head off.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.120]   Don't linger.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.360]   Don't make them think that, "How are the kids?
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   How are you?
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360]   I care about you.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   You're a great human being."
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.080]   None of the stuff at the beginning.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.540]   Warn them bad news is coming and hit them with the bad news.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.300]   Rip the bandaid off.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.320]   The pain is not if you try to rip the bandaid off slowly.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400]   That's excruciating and you're trying to save yourself.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.960]   If you got to terminate a relationship regardless of what it is, the quicker you do it, the
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.880]   less painless it is, the sooner people can move on.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.240]   Stop trying to save yourself.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.060]   Realize how human beings handle pain.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.040]   If anything, human beings are incredibly resilient if given the opportunity to brace themselves
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.120]   first.
