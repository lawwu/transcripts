[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   So we've arrived at the new year season, as longtime listeners know, I'm not a big believer
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.040]   in making major changes in January.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.480]   I actually think the beginning of fall is the right time to trigger big life transformations.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.600]   But this is still a good break point in the middle of the active year to step back, take
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.840]   stock, tighten up, and improve some areas of your life that could use some improving.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520]   So here's what I want to do today.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.820]   I have four simple ideas.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.520]   We can call them mid-year course corrections that are all designed to do two things, one,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.120]   help you reclaim some depth in areas where our currently distracted world might be robbing
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.920]   that depth, and two, be something that you can execute right away.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.800]   So these are not massive multi-month changes, but small course corrections you can put into
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.400]   place right away.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.680]   Half of these will deal with your life outside of work, half of these will deal with your
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.520]   life in work, and I'm trying to keep them a little bit novel.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.400]   So I'm not going to want to give a little twist to these, it'll sound a little bit new
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.600]   even to our longtime listeners, all right?
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.660]   Idea number one of four, bring a book.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.560]   So what I'm recommending here is that you get into the habit of bringing a physical
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.560]   book with you.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.560]   When you go to work, when you go out, when you're around the house, and you get in the
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.800]   habit of when you're bored, temporarily bored, not I have three hours to kill, but I'm waiting
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.660]   in line or I'm eating lunch at my desk, turn to the book instead of your phone.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.000]   Make this book fun, make it portable, you probably want to go paperback, maybe you want
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   to get an old used mass market paperback of like a fun novel from the 1970s that's like
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   exciting to go back and read, or a nonfiction book that's covering some topic you really
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420]   care about, like how to get healthier, or maybe it's like narrative nonfiction, I want
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.000]   to go back and read some classic crack hour and it's just straight up fun, whatever it
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   is.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.240]   Portable, fun, it's just with you, read a book when you're bored.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.600]   What's my explanation for why this idea makes sense?
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.040]   Well essentially this is a form of what's known as dopamine fasting.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.800]   Our modern digital environment, which is in some sense the antagonist in almost everything
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.360]   we talk about here on this show, has helped create these very tight connections in our
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:30.680]   reward system in our brain where boredom activates this network in our brain as we've trained
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.500]   it, and we get this very strong dopamine hit that urges us to take the action of looking
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.560]   at a screen because we have made these strong neural connections that says that screen is
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.000]   going to bring us this really salient reward, right?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.240]   It's going to be a really big emotional hit, outrage, hilarity, fascination, inside information
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.360]   inspiration, really strong hit.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.920]   And so what happens is boredom triggers the dopamine cascade, which makes it really hard
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.020]   not to pick up your phone.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.320]   So dopamine fasting is where you specifically practice essentially ignoring that cascade,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.240]   at least the behavior that that cascade is pushing, and redirecting it towards a different
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.440]   behavior, in this case looking towards a book.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   And at first it's difficult, and then over time your mind sort of rewires and gets more
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   used to this slower, more cognitively sophisticated response to boredom.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.480]   And so that strong connection of screen, screen, screen when bored becomes a weaker connection,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.400]   and you're more comfortable just slowing down your cognition and turning to something a
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.600]   little bit more systematic, it's going to feel like you're coming off of amphetamines
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.040]   after a multi-year binge.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   It really does.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.160]   This type of dopamine fasting can really change your experience of the world.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.320]   So that's my first piece of advice, bring a book.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   Second piece of advice, let's go from your life outside of work to your life in work,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.600]   and I'm going to suggest deep clean your email inbox.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   Now this is going to take two, three, maybe four hours, depending on how big your inbox
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   is.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   We're going to take our time here.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.480]   It's not something you're going to dash off in 20 minutes.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.200]   You're going to put aside, you know, a half day, maybe like right after the new year to
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.920]   do this.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.100]   And here's the key of a deep clean of your inbox.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.020]   You're actually going to spend time with every message that is in there.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.360]   As opposed to what we normally do when we turn to an inbox, which is trying to scramble
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.400]   to get that thing empty as fast as possible to ignore, to defer, to play obligation hot
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   potato where you send some incomplete, incoherent message to someone else because it temporarily
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.700]   takes the responsibility represented by that message off your plate.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.200]   This is the thoughts with a Z at the end question mark send.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.760]   You know this is not actually going to solve the problem.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.920]   They're going to come back to you like you've saved yourself no time in the long run, but
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.520]   that message is out of your inbox and in the moment you just want that inbox empty.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.780]   This is what we want to avoid with the inbox deep clean.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.960]   Instead we want to actually seriously consider each message.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   Now what do we do when we seriously consider that message?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.920]   We ask the question, what is the underlying project commitment or process that generated
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.720]   this message?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.240]   And am I happy with the way I am currently engaging with that right now?
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   All right.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   That sounds abstract.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.480]   So let's get concrete.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.120]   Here's an easy case.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   There's a message in there.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.080]   It's just some mailing list from a product.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.520]   Maybe you bought two years ago and now the company is spamming you or whatever.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.240]   You sit there like, what is this message?
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.320]   Oh, it is generated by me being on a mailing list because I bought something from this
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   company.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.960]   What relationship do I want with that?
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   None.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.120]   I don't need to see what REI is up to right now.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.000]   I'm going to take the time to unsubscribe.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And so you deal with it.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You change your relationship.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Okay.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Next message.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Right.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.240]   This is from a group at an organization that I'm a part of that I'm sort of loosely involved
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   with this group.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.560]   And they're going back and forth.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   And it's part of a discussion to try to figure out a date for the next time that group is
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.000]   going to meet.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.840]   Let me step back and say, what is my relationship to that underlying system?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.160]   And maybe you say, you know what?
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.320]   This is probably one too many things.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.680]   I don't really have time to be doing this group right now.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   I like the idea.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.500]   But really, I haven't been able to engage much.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.960]   And I'm kind of doing this halfheartedly.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.920]   Let me now change my relationship to this underlying processor system and say, hey,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   whatever.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.280]   I'm going to have to step away for the rest of this year.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   I didn't have the time.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   I thought I would.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.360]   So again, we're getting to the root causes of the messages instead of just the messages
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.240]   themselves.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.480]   Now maybe what you see an email from is not something you can walk away from or unsubscribe
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   from.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.320]   Maybe it's a message, this will be common in the work context, that's part of a conversation
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.400]   about a project that you're working on that's important and you have to do.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.560]   I agreed to be on this search committee.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.080]   This email is about this search committee.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.280]   It's some question about, hey, what about this particular candidate?
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.400]   In this case, what you can do is step back and say, not do I want to step away from this
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.760]   commitment or not, but say, let me think through how I actually want to engage with it.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.980]   What should be, in this case, our rules for collaboration?
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.200]   Let's put a little bit of structure in here because otherwise, I think this thing, this
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.320]   hiring committee in this example, is going to keep generating lots of messages that have
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.920]   to be responded and it's going to be a source of clutter and context shifting.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   So this is, I'm going to sit down and take the time to figure out, how should we deal
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   with this?
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.020]   Well, OK, I'm just being hypothetical here.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.320]   But in this example, it's like, OK, people are coming up with candidates, we probably
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:47.120]   should have a shared document somewhere where people add candidates onto it as they come
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.800]   up with ideas or they think of someone who might be good.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.520]   We should probably have a meeting on the books for like a month from now.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.040]   And the goal there should actually be to review all these candidates that people have found.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.400]   And so we should be searching for these and putting them in this document.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.080]   And then we have this meeting.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.840]   And the point of this meeting is going to be to review these things, figure out who
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.920]   we want to follow up on.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.560]   And at that point, we'll come up with like our process for doing that.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   OK, great.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   This will be much better.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.860]   This will avoid a lot of random emails.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.640]   Let me now do a process-centric message right now.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.200]   That's a concept from Deep Work, where you preamble an email message with a description
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.640]   of the process you want people to follow in responding to that.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.680]   So now you just send out this big message to everyone, hey, this is great.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   Here's what I propose.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   I set up this document.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.840]   I moved the existing candidates into it.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.800]   Let us all now actively fill this document over the next three weeks.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.120]   Let's put a meeting on the books for Friday.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.200]   I'm just going to book it for right after our faculty meeting.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.880]   And if we need to change that, we'll change that.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   Let me know.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.920]   But let's just make that the default.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.400]   And by the way, I'll send some reminders about this.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.200]   And then you put some notes on your calendar for two weeks from then and three weeks from
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.840]   then to, hey, email the group and say, no response required, just a reminder.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   Be looking for candidates.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.480]   We're meeting after the faculty meeting.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.380]   This all takes more time.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.760]   But now you've changed your relationship to the underlying obligation processor system
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.480]   here in a way that, good, I'm comfortable with this.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.560]   This thing is not going to generate a lot of non-scheduled urgent messages that require
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.300]   responses.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.840]   Another thing that might happen as you're deep cleaning your inbox is you might come
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.120]   up with friction interventions, like someone's asking you to do something, asking you for
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.960]   help or assistance.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.900]   It's not a case where you just want to say no, but a lot of these are coming in.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.160]   Do a friction intervention.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.200]   A friction intervention is where you essentially give some more work to the person on the other
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   side.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   Hey, happy to help you.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.960]   What you should do is your next steps.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.120]   And 50% of the time, they're just not going to do it, which shows that this really wasn't
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   that important for them.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.920]   And in the 50% of the time where they do do those extra steps, you've designed them so
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.760]   that it makes your life a lot easier.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.960]   I get this-- I'll give you a specific example in my role as a director of undergraduate
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   studies for the computer science department at Georgetown.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.560]   One of the things I do is I help advise students who are thinking about becoming a computer
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   science major.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.680]   Now, I'll get a lot of messages where people are like, hey, I'm thinking about becoming
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   a major.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   What do you think?
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.480]   Or can I just swing by and we'll chat about it?
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.880]   And I always give a friction intervention, which makes life easier on both sides, where
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.920]   I say, here's what we need.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.000]   I need a schedule.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   All your semesters left here at Georgetown.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Your plan.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Go through.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.880]   Learn the curriculum.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.640]   And put in a plan for which courses you're going to take when.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.600]   And then I can look at that, and that will give me a real sense of, is it realistic?
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.880]   Do you have enough time left to finish the major?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.520]   Is it going to be a stretch?
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.640]   Are you close, but maybe we need to think about one summer course to make this happen?
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.920]   Do that work first.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.680]   There's a couple benefits to this.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.160]   One, it sort of makes sure that you're actually serious about this.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.880]   You're not just, hey, maybe I should be a computer science major, because it requires
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   some work.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.000]   Two, it forces the student to learn the curriculum.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.240]   Otherwise, every student I was meeting with, I was just teaching them how the requirement
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.960]   structure works for our course, again and again and again.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.020]   And that's kind of a waste of time.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.440]   This is a way of making sure the student themselves figures out what's going on.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.820]   And then three, it makes things more efficient.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.700]   Now I know exactly what we're dealing with.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.320]   If we don't have to work this out together, now we can talk and write down the brass tacks.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.840]   Like, OK, yeah, perfect.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840]   This looks fine.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   You should have no problem.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   Let's go.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   We don't even have to talk about it.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   This is impossible.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   Right?
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.600]   Like, look at-- now that you've seen how many courses you'd have to take per semester, you
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.960]   can see this is impossible-- a friction intervention.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.040]   And so again, that you're saying, what is the underlying source of this message?
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:50.240]   How do I make sure my relationship to that source is as effective as possible?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.820]   So that's a deep clean of your inbox.
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.280]   It takes forever, because think about it.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.760]   Each of these things might take a while to actually work through.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.480]   But you do this refresh, this deep clean, once or twice a year.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   You pay.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.680]   You receive these huge rewards.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.880]   Like, for the next six months, you've taken yourself off of all of these mailing lists.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.560]   You've cleaned shop on the obligations you stumbled into, and now you realize you shouldn't
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.920]   be doing.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.640]   The things you are working on are now more structured.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.960]   So it's much less unrestricted emails landing in your inbox.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.160]   Now you don't have to check your inbox as much.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.920]   And you've sort of gotten some friction interventions in place for stuff that you do want to help
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   with.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.360]   But it's being a little bit too urgent and ad hoc, and you want to make that a little
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   bit more structured.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.320]   If you do this type of deep clean twice a year, the whole rest of those other months
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.720]   are going to actually-- your relationship to your inbox is going to be much better.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.000]   The frequency with which you check it is going to go down.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.160]   The value of what's in there is going to go up.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.880]   Your overall frustration with the cognitive experience of knowledge work is going to improve.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.440]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.920]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:02.400]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.840]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.200]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.000]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Check it out.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.720]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.640]   All right.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.280]   Story number three, shift back to life outside of work.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.920]   Take a break from online news, especially if you're in the US.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   We had an election.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.720]   That's a lot of pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft hitting you from the online world.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.900]   There's an inauguration coming up.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.680]   Really not much happens in January because everything has to kind of stop as you're waiting
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.360]   for the new president to come in, and then it takes a minute for that to all get kind
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   of going again.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.200]   So what you get is a lot of just invented concern and outrage and people in the attention
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.400]   economy trying to fight for and generate reasons to have attention.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.520]   It's a perfect month to say, I think the republic will stand if they do not have my vigilant
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.240]   monitoring for the next four weeks.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.080]   What this gives you is like coming out of the holidays and family time, an ability for
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.960]   that part of your brain to just take a breather.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:22.560]   The innervation of all of this high urgency, world shaking, terror inducing news that just
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.760]   take that drip out of your proverbial arm for a month is going to allow the whole system
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.480]   to re-stabilize and to calm back down.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.760]   The explanation for this, again, if we go back to the modern digital environment, I've
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.160]   talked about this before.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.880]   Our paleolithic brain interprets, when the news is coming to us in like a social media
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.760]   feed or this or that, or on a podcast, like a news political podcast, we don't think about
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.580]   the degree to which this is delivered.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.200]   It feels personal, right?
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.800]   On social media, it's individual people that you might follow talking about it.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.060]   Your paleolithic brain is like, yeah, these are tribe members of ours.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.480]   What it's missing is that these conversations are being curated out of 500 million active
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:13.560]   monthly users on one of these platforms and algorithms, cybernetic algorithms, half optimization,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:19.640]   half human behavior with re-amplification, are sorting through these millions and millions
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.120]   and millions of huge cacophony and pulling out for you this curated thing that's very
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.440]   tractable and feels like a conversation outside the cave 150,000 years ago.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.500]   Our mind interprets our relationship with online news because it's so personalized.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.840]   It's this person I follow, it's a voice in my head on a podcast.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.520]   It is as if like the tribe that you're a part of is having constant, massive, existentially
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.960]   threatening crises, and of course our brain's going to take that seriously.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.340]   You're in a state of crisis all the time.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.720]   This is an interesting, by the way, techno critique.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.440]   Some of this is unique to the faux personalization of online or digital news delivery in the
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.860]   21st century.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:12.160]   If you were picking up a newspaper in 1985, like a big, thick Sunday New York Times, that
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.320]   does not come across to your paleolithic brain as people in your tribe are really worried
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.040]   and we should be worried.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.920]   It's abstracted in a linguistic way.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.740]   It's on paper.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.000]   It's one of 500 articles in that paper written by different journalists.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.080]   We have a different relationship to it.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.840]   It's a lexicographic relationship.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.880]   It's a relationship like you would have with a book.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.920]   When you read a book, you don't feel like that person is right there in your tribe.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.400]   You realize that this is someone distant, this is someone abstract.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   I'm reading this book.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.480]   I don't know this author.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.080]   It doesn't feel so personal.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.920]   We had in what Neil Postman would have called the lexicographic culture, the pre-TV, pre-internet
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.880]   newspaper book-driven culture, this medium had a different psychosocial relationship
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.480]   with us than these modern mediums.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.760]   I could read the world news and think in the broad world out there, there's things that
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.080]   are happening and it didn't feel as personally salient.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:18.120]   Take a break from online news, social media, news websites, news podcasts.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   Just take a break from them for a month.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.840]   You'll be okay.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.400]   People will tell you what's going on.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.600]   Let me summarize all the US news.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:33.040]   I'll do a summary now of every news article for the next four weeks.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.440]   Democrat does something, Republicans think it's the worst thing that ever happened.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.760]   A Republican does something, the Democrats think it's the worst thing to ever happen.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.920]   People trade quotes, someone's nasty online.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   There you go.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   That is January 2025.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.960]   I just summarized what you're going to miss.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.480]   Take a break.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.600]   Let your mind restabilize.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.920]   Idea number four, back to the world of work, is simulate status meetings.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:06.680]   I'm going to start here with the explanation, then I'll get to the solution.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.160]   We have this big problem.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.860]   This is at the core of my book, Slow Productivity, first part of the solution section.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:21.160]   We have a real problem with the modern digital environment is the abstraction of work in
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.760]   the knowledge sector, where it's just people plugged into computers and phones and passing
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   emails and Zoom and everything is digital and it's information and it's in this hyperactive
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.600]   hive mind of just back and forth communication where we're sort of all working together and
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.040]   we're kind of on our own.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:43.920]   In that environment where work is non-tangible, overload becomes very easy.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.320]   It is very easy just to have too many things you've committed to do because there's no
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:55.160]   barriers to asking someone to do something and there's no physical instantiation of the
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.020]   work itself.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:03.720]   If I'm a cobbler in the 17th century, if I have too many shoes that I'm working on, there's
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.080]   a big pile of shoes next to me.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.880]   If you're bringing in a new pair of shoes, you can see that big pile of shoes.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.420]   If I say I have too many shoes to work on right now, you're like, "I get that.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.880]   That's going to take a while."
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.760]   I see these physical things that I can directly translate into a time cost.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.720]   You've got a week's worth of shoes to repair there.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   That makes sense.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.260]   In the digital world, there's no shoes.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.400]   It's just a bunch of emails that you've answered in an inbox that has 2,000 messages that if
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.680]   you really go through there actually work itself out to be 25 different ongoing commitments,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.240]   each of which generating their own conversations and expectations, and of course you're drowning.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.320]   You're the cobbler who the shoes are so crowded that they're falling out the door.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.840]   All right, so we have to be more careful about workload management.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   That brings me to the idea, which is simulate status meetings.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.340]   In a perfect world, and I write about this in Slow Productivity, in a perfect world,
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.360]   the team you work with would have a centralized place where they keep track of all the things
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.280]   that the team needs to do, and most of those things will be in a column that's waiting
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   to work on these.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.080]   Then over here, you would have a column for each of the people on the team, and you have
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.120]   the specific things they're working on in those columns.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.620]   It would probably just be one or two things.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.440]   You would have a very clear work-in-progress limit in Kanban, which uses these boards.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.000]   They call it the WIP, the work-in-progress limit.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.120]   You would also have very structured collaboration.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.000]   Every day, 10-minute status meeting, who's working on what, and what do they need from
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   other people.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.200]   Great, now we can just go rock and roll.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.360]   Make sure you get them that by this time, you get them this by this time.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   We all agree.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.800]   Now just go work.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.280]   In an imperfect world where you don't control your team, you can simulate something like
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   this.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.400]   What I recommend is on Monday mornings, you actually have your own board.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.960]   You could do that digitally, of course.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.920]   Here are all the different things I've committed to work on.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.840]   I got to face that productivity drag, and I can't pretend like it's not true.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.960]   Here's all the stuff I've committed to work on.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.120]   What is the statuses of these things this week?
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.760]   I'm going to have a column of what I'm actively working on this week.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.720]   I could only fit so many.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   Look at my calendar.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   I have all these meetings and stuff.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.880]   I could probably make progress on three of these things, so I'll move those three things
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   over.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.640]   I'm going to update those people.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.520]   Hey, I'm working to people related to the three things I'm actually working on.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.200]   Hey, I'm working on this week.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.080]   As if you were in the room with me for an old-fashioned, Agile-style status meeting,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.020]   in that email on Monday, like, "Hey, I'm working on this this week.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.160]   Here's what I need from you this week.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.080]   This information by this time, put it in this place.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.560]   This information by that time, put it in this place.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.880]   If you can do that, I'll finish this."
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.120]   Now what you've basically done is you've simulated a status meeting.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.520]   You know what you're working on.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.100]   You're going to get the stuff you need without having just sort of like ad hoc bother people
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.040]   along the way, and the people you're working with are happy because they know exactly what
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.720]   you're doing and that you're working on their things.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.080]   You can do the inverse for the things you choose not to work on.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.600]   Update those people during your simulated status meeting.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.360]   "Hey, I just wanted to let you know I have this.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.400]   It's not one of the three or four things I'm actively working on this week, but I just
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.840]   want you to know I haven't forgotten about it, and it's here, and I keep track of this
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.280]   stuff very carefully."
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.440]   They're happy.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.440]   You're on the ball.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.440]   You're organized.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.000]   They're not going to bother you with emails or meetings because they know you're not actually
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.300]   working on it.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.480]   You've solved their problem of having to worry about this.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.240]   They know you're on the ball.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.700]   You're basically for—you're tricking—people don't realize this, but you've sort of secretly
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:24.540]   created status meetings and work-in-progress boards without other people knowing.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:30.020]   These simulate status meetings can go a long way towards at least sanding the blunt edges
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.380]   off of the worst of overload and bad workload management.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.400]   So those are my four easy course corrections.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.520]   You can do all of these in the next couple of weeks.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.960]   I'll just say them again real quick.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.800]   Bring a book.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   Deep clean your inbox.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.640]   That's a one-time thing.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.080]   Take a break from online news and simulate status meetings.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.280]   That's something you're going to do once a week.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.740]   Lots of other things at work, but hey, there's a lot of mismatches between the modern digital
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.960]   environment and our Paleolithic brains and Neolithic culture, so here's a couple places
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.080]   where you can reduce that mismatch just a little bit.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.640]   I've heard Ryan Holiday talk about his rule where he just buys any book that piques his
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   interest.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   Do you have a similar rule?
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   Yep.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   Yep.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   I just buy.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.180]   I mean, I've got to say, throughout my career as a writer, there's been different milestones
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.760]   in terms of coolness, like, "Oh, I could do this now.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.460]   I could do that now."
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.940]   I still think one of the best milestones in my writing career—it was early in—I'm
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.940]   on my blog.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.940]   Before, it was a newsletter.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.440]   It was just the studyhacksblog@calnewport.com, and I used to have—the only income source
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.240]   from that was Amazon Associates.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   I listed some things I liked, like the notebook I use and some books I liked, and you get
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.360]   a commission if people buy it through Amazon, and I was getting the commissions delivered
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.820]   to me monthly as Amazon gift certificates.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:59.040]   I remember this point—this would have been like 2007, 2008—where I was getting $100
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.000]   a month or something in gift certificates, and I would just add them.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.040]   You could just add them into your Amazon account, so that if you bought something, it would
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.760]   pull from your gift certificates first.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.320]   I remembered at some point, I was like, "I can buy books with impunity.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.200]   There's enough of this Amazon gift certificate money that I really don't have to worry
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.320]   about it," because it was outside of our normal budget that we had.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   I just was putting gift certificates into the Amazon account, and to me, that was the
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.700]   biggest thing.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.960]   If I heard of a book that was interesting, I could just buy it and spend $50, $60, $70,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.520]   $100 a month just buying books.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.000]   That was a big deal for me at the time.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.400]   Obviously, things have been more renumerative since then, but I still think that was one
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400]   of the coolest things.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   I'm a big believer.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.560]   If you can afford it, buy books.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.760]   It helps authors.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760]   Books are awesome.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.520]   It's the best deal for the money.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:54.840]   $20, you're getting years of expertise distilled carefully with a team that has spent months
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.680]   and months just trying to get it as carefully crafted as possible, then you can simulate
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.320]   that mind and intake that into your own head, and you can do this all for $20.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.880]   Get not only new wisdom, but 20 to 40 hours' worth of good, high-quality distraction out
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   of it.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:19.540]   It's the best deal, I think, in entertainment, so yeah, buy books, buy books, and who cares?
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.540]   You have too many of them?
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.540]   Give them away.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.900]   I don't think it's a problem.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.660]   They're very imminently recyclable, so I'm a big believer.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.660]   Buy, buy, buy.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.380]   And then second question, how many of the students actually do the follow-up work of
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.820]   the friction stuff that you discussed?
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.780]   In this case, it's pretty high because typically, if they are interested in majoring, they're
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.780]   interested in majoring.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.580]   The interesting thing is the students, they'll try a few times to get out of it.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.740]   They'll be like, "So, yeah, I don't know.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.700]   I have a lot of courses to take," or whatever.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.700]   It's an important obstacle.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.700]   Like, "No, no, no.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700]   You've got to sit down.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.700]   It's going to take you 20 minutes.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.260]   You've got to do the 20 minutes of work."
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.380]   There's a lot of like, "Yeah, my schedule would be probably reasonable.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.940]   I've taken this many courses so far."
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.820]   It's like, "I want to see the list."
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.100]   There's a lot of that in academic administration.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.460]   I didn't do this, but an earlier director of undergraduate studies did this with applying
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:24.420]   for credit, like, "I'm going to take this course overseas when I'm studying abroad.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.740]   Can I get approved for this to count towards the major?"
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:33.720]   That got very systematized at some point in a way that puts a little bit more work onto
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.180]   the seat of the student.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:40.020]   But the thing about those type of things is a little bit more work for one student doesn't
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.360]   mean much to that student.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.620]   It's another 10 minutes of their life.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.940]   Putting that same work on the single person who has to process all those requests could
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.260]   be hours and hours and hours of extra time.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.900]   So I do like friction interventions.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.860]   Friction interventions are a good, they're a high-quality thing.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.900]   I'm in favor.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.900]   All right.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.340]   So we got a bunch of cool questions coming up, but first, let's hear from a sponsor that
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.340]   makes this show possible.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.340]   I want to talk about our friends at 8sleep.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.100]   I'm sure you've heard of 8sleep.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.600]   Their buzzworthy sleep technology called the Pod can be added to your existing mattress
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.980]   like a fitted sheet to automatically cool down and warm up each side of your bed and
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.460]   in turn improve your sleep quality dramatically.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.540]   Athletes, business titans, and celebrities all swear by the Pod, but more importantly,
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.820]   I swear by the Pod.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.940]   My wife and I love our 8sleep.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:41.460]   We've actually spread the gospel of 8sleep to other people in our friend circle as well.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.900]   We both like to sleep cool and it just is fantastic.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.500]   The way it works, I'll explain it real briefly, you put like a mattress cover, but in this
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.740]   mattress cover is a fine capillary of all these little tubes and then it connects to
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.900]   a box that looks like a computer tower that's next to your bed and it cools or heats liquid
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.300]   which it then can send through these capillaries to cool down or heat up each of the side of
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   the bed.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   It's really fantastic, right?
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.640]   Because we have like a lot of blankets on in the winter, just having like a little bit
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.740]   of coolness in your 8sleep just pulls away just enough heat that you don't oversleep.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.620]   Anyways, we become addicted to it.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.960]   It's kind of a problem because we have trouble in hotels.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.540]   We have trouble when we're like we're going to have trouble next week when we're away
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.260]   for Christmas vacation because we don't have our 8sleep with us.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.580]   That's how used to it we've become.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.900]   They have a new version.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.320]   That's what I wanted to tell you about.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.120]   Their newest version of the Pod is called the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.980]   It cools, it heats, now it elevates automatically.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.100]   It's clinically proven to give you one more hour of quality sleep per night.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:50.420]   If you want the details, you can cool down each side of the bed to 20 degrees below room
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   temperature.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.340]   So even in a heatwave, you're going to feel plenty cool.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.060]   It also has an adjustable base that fits between your mattress and your bed frame to add reading
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.140]   and sleeping positions for the best unwinding experience.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:06.300]   So this sort of mechanical element, that's new to the Pod 4 Ultra, which is fantastic.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:13.140]   It can also even detect snoring and automatically adjust your sleeping position to stop you
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.540]   from snoring.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:20.380]   So anyways, 8sleep, it is a luxury that I swear by.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.540]   I'm spoiled for it.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.540]   I highly recommend it.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.000]   This is one of these things I'm happy to endorse because I use it all the time.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:37.040]   So if you head to 8sleep.com/deep and use the code DEEP at checkout, you can get $350
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.560]   off the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:47.880]   That's 8sleep.com/deep, spell out the word 8, and use the code DEEP to get $350 off.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.620]   Currently ships to the United States, Canada, the UK, Europe, and Australia.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.920]   Also want to talk about Defender.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.640]   The iconic Defender line of vehicles has been reimagined for a new generation of explorers.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.520]   The Defender 90, 110, and the 130, which can seat up to eight passengers, all maintained
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.840]   a legendary off-road capability for which the Defender is known, but now combined with
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.680]   legendary new on-road capabilities as well.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.540]   They are a pleasure to drive with all the fancy driver assist technology you might like.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.720]   They also look good.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   Look these up online.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.320]   Go over to LandRoverUSA.com to look at how these Defenders look because I think aesthetically
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.540]   they feature compelling proportions and precise detailing.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.200]   They're combined with that tough, rigid body design, however, that makes them so famously
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:43.960]   durable and the cargo capacity, the fantastic balance between comfort and exploration, durability
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   and aesthetics.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.880]   It's a good looking car that performs perfect for finding adventure as you cultivate your
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.240]   own idea of the deep life.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.040]   Visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about Defender.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.840]   Hi Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   First question's from Declan.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.360]   Do you have advice on how to stop doom scrolling before bed?
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.840]   I find myself spending 30 to 45 minutes before bed on social media and I want to replace
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.540]   that time with reading books.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.840]   I've never been a big reader so I find it tough to break the habit.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.740]   Well the obvious advice is you keep your phone somewhere far from your room.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.880]   So now the friction of scrolling is much higher.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.920]   You have to get out of bed, go down to where your phone is, unplug it and bring it back
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.260]   to your room.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.200]   Hopefully that friction is high enough that it's easier to resist.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.900]   So that's part of it.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:37.580]   If you worry about having a clock or phone in your room, just get a standalone phone
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.620]   or clock.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.440]   You might consider, for example, one of our sponsors of this show is Lofty.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440]   L-O-F-T-I-E.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.240]   They have these sort of beautiful alarm clocks you can put next to your bed.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.080]   They have all sorts of cool features.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   You also want to make what you do when you're in bed without your phone, you want to make
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.040]   that as compelling as possible.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.660]   So find books you're really excited to read.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.360]   They're just fun.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.220]   You don't need to read a tome at night.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.700]   You don't need to read the latest great novel because people told you this is a smart novel
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.440]   that everyone is supposed to read but you find it kind of boring.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.940]   This is for fun reading and it could be memoir nonfiction of just someone you think is really
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.420]   interesting or, you know, I like to read about movies, you could be reading about movies
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.840]   or movie making or whatever your interest is, adventure novels, romance novels, something
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.120]   that's just really fun to read.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.080]   You can make that a fun habit.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.980]   Something I sometimes suggest, which the phone, not anti-phone people, but the sort of digital
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:41.740]   hygiene people don't always agree with, is I don't think it's the worst thing to do a
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:46.140]   little bit of stimuli reduction here using something like an iPad.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.140]   So hear me out.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:53.160]   If you have an iPad that has no social apps on it, right, you don't use it to go on the
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.180]   internet but you have streaming services on it, I actually think it's not so bad if as
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:04.100]   part of your routine you say, "First I do is I read," and it's always one or two chapters,
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   right?
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.700]   So you're just used to doing it, it kind of calms you down, but then you know that you're
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.820]   going to be able to, you have something you're going to watch a little bit after that in
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:19.140]   bed on your iPad that is completely comforting comfort food, that series you've watched a
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.140]   hundred times before.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.180]   I'm just going to watch like 20 minutes of an episode.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.220]   That's not the worst thing.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.180]   For some people, what it does is it gives them this sort of stimulation matching that
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.700]   they need.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.340]   What happens is when they're not used to reading books and all they're going to do is read
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:38.700]   a book, when they're so saturated in that dopamine-mediated digital experience, it's
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.660]   not enough stimulation and it's like you're trying to fast and they get antsy about it.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.500]   It's like, "Oh man, I'm a little antsy, like I, this is, I'm used to this type of stimulation
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   and all I'm doing is reading and they have a hard time falling asleep, so just do a little
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.220]   bit of this step-down."
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.740]   It's, I don't know, we could call it dopamine methadone or something.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:02.300]   I read and then it's, you know, an episode of The Office that I've seen five times.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   It does work.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.780]   People, their mind's like, "Okay, phew, I got that relief," but it's not doom scrolling,
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.900]   it's not social media, it's not so algorithmically salient, it's, you know, it's comfort food.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.620]   So I'm, if you need that, I think that's perfectly fine, but make yourself earn it with books
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.060]   first and then the books will become much more appealing because of that.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.620]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.380]   Next question's from Nelson.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.560]   Can you please dive further into the deep stack from your three small daily habits video?
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.500]   How can you do the craft part if you haven't figured out what you want to be good at because
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.580]   you don't even know what your values are?
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.340]   Or are you supposed to excel at one of the areas from the discipline box?
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.580]   All right, so I had to go back.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:48.380]   It's a little complicated because the video that Nelson is referring to is not from that
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.380]   long ago.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.900]   It's from a month ago, but it's a clip.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   It's a clip collection.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:57.540]   So our YouTube guy will sometimes grab some clips from older episodes and put them on
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   the feed.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.300]   It's from a much older episode, actually, where this clip was taken.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   So I was giving a variation on my deep life stack, my sort of step-by-step approach for
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.420]   cultivating a deep life.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:17.820]   In that video, so in that particular variation, I don't really remember where the original
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:23.540]   video was from, I first divided, I said, "We really need two stacks."
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.580]   The first stack is focused on what you need to do first, which is becoming like an eminently
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.100]   capable human being.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.860]   The second stack, I said in this video, is cultivating depth.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:38.060]   It's where you actually work to make specific changes in your life that are designed to
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.180]   make your life more intentional.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.180]   It's where you get very systematic about reshaping your life.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.700]   And my argument was you got to do the first thing first.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.900]   You got to become just a capable person and get your act together before you can then
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.820]   make high-level, complicated, intentional changes to your life.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.780]   That was basically the argument.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.100]   Within each of those two sides of the screen, I then gave a stack, a sort of step-by-steps
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:03.660]   to go through, and on that become an eminently capable person side, one of the things in
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.560]   that stack was craft.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:12.940]   This brings us back to Nelson's question, because the other side, where you had the
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.320]   now, you cultivate depth, that's where you figure out your values and come up with your
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.740]   lifestyle-centric plans and really get into what I want in my life.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.980]   Nelson is saying, "How can I work on craft first if it's not till I get to the second
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.180]   side, the second stack, that I figure out what I even care about?
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.380]   How do I figure out," this is how I read his question, "How do I figure out what to do
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:35.280]   for craft if I don't even know what matters to me?"
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.900]   The answer, Nelson, is if you go back and watch that video, the craft that shows up
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:45.400]   on that first become an eminently human stack, the way I explained that was just get good
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.480]   at something.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.780]   Choose something to get better at.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.500]   It could be professional.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.540]   It could be personal.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.740]   Just learn a craft.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.420]   And this was not figure out what your job is going to be or spend 10 years mastering
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.360]   something that you're going to build your career around.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.180]   It was instead, just get used to the feeling of getting good at something.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.860]   What does it feel like to get better at something?
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:15.420]   So this really could be, "I'm going to learn how to wire up an Arduino light controller.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.500]   I'm just learning a thing."
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.140]   And for me, in that video, I was saying, "It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.620]   I just want you as part of becoming an eminently capable person to get comfortable with the
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.780]   deliberate practice and improvement.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.380]   Oh, if I give things attention, I get better at it."
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.120]   So then when you go to the second half and say, "Now I'm going to shape my life,"
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.980]   you have confidence and experience with how to, when I need to like master something as
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.740]   part of that much more sophisticated plan, I know how to do that.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.140]   So that's what I meant by that.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.940]   But I will say, let me fast forward to today.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.620]   Let me revisit this topic because I'm writing a book about this, a book called "The Deep
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.620]   Life," which, by the way, will be a while until that comes out.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   I'm taking my time.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.620]   So just FYI.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.620]   This is the problem.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.620]   I'll say this as an aside.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.660]   My publisher noticed this.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.660]   The problem with me writing "Slow Productivity" before I wrote "The Deep Life" is "Slow
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.460]   Productivity" is about slowing down.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.740]   So now it's going to take me a long time to finish "The Deep Life."
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:13.100]   If it had gone the other way, they would have got that book much faster.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.420]   But excuse me, I learned writing "Slow Productivity" like, "Oh, you can take your time.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.460]   It's okay.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.220]   Take an extra year.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.820]   No one is going to notice in the grand scheme of things, but like the next three years are
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:23.820]   going to be much nicer."
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:30.180]   Anyways, in that book, as I'm thinking about the book, I've simplified this even more.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:37.340]   I mean, I've kept that same structure, become a capable human, get your act together.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.940]   Then start caring about what you want to do with that.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.100]   I've kept that structure.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.620]   I'm not as rigid within that structure anymore.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.620]   Within that structure, how do you become a more capable person?
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.780]   I'm not going to give you seven steps to go through that are too ordered.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.700]   I want to give you a little bit more breathing room in there.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:39:00.220]   So like right now, the part of the book that's about preparing, I talk about discipline.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.660]   I talk about getting organized.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.580]   I talk about reclaiming your brain from distractions, learn how to think again, but it's not presented
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:13.520]   as like A, B, and C. It's like these are these three things you have to grapple with before
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.820]   you're ready to make change.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.620]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.020]   Next question is from Timmy.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:23.380]   "After listening to your most recent episode on money, I have an overall question about
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.540]   budgeting as I'm in my 20s.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.260]   I want to save for a house, but I also want to have enough for unexpected expenses."
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.940]   All right, excuse me.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.380]   All right, let's think about this.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.860]   How do you save money when you're in your 20s?
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:42.540]   It can be pretty daunting to think about saving for a house when you're that early on.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:49.160]   All right, so I have three books, well, two books and one article to recommend, and then
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.560]   I'll talk a little bit about what I did, which I actually don't think is the right, I would
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   recommend it.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   I don't think I'd recommend it.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.840]   All right, the first book I would recommend relevant to this topic was written by my friend
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   Ramit Sethi.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.160]   It's called I Will Teach You to Be Rich.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   I've known Ramit forever.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.400]   We're the same age.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.200]   He was graduating Stanford at the same time I was graduating Dartmouth, and we've known
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.880]   each other off and on for a long time.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.460]   That book is great because he wrote it in his 20s.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.480]   I remember when he was working on it.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.640]   So it is actually very well geared, Timmy, for exactly the stage of life that you're
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.140]   in right now.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.040]   The cool thing about it, I'll just give you the main idea.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:31.360]   A big part of his idea is automate the savings, and then you don't have to be as obsessive
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.440]   about what you do with the money that's left, because the money that's left is the money
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   that's left.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.900]   So his whole system is not hard, is you're automatically pulling money out of your paycheck
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.500]   and saving it.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.520]   You set it up to do it automatically.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:52.960]   Then hey, don't overspend what remains, because your bank account, whatever it is, it'll empty
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   out.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.400]   There's no tricking yourself here.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.560]   This is the money that remains.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.280]   But the automatic saving is his key thing, and then don't oversweat it.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.840]   Don't spend more than you have, but if you're 20 and single, you don't have to have a complicated
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.840]   household budget.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.780]   You can figure out how much can I afford before my debit card says you have no money.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.620]   The key thing about this is then as your income goes up, you already have the framework in
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.740]   place for automatic savings, so you're just increasing the amount you're automatically
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.740]   saving.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.220]   He's basically saying that's your best bet from a financial engineering perspective.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:30.540]   All right, if you want to consider more extreme options of that, the classic article is Mr.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.720]   Money Mustache's article "The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement."
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.580]   This is one of the articles that sort of helped make the FIRE, Financial Independence Retire
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.740]   Early community, go mainstream.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:50.900]   And basically the idea there is if you live on a very small fraction of your income, so
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:55.980]   like you really push your expenses down, and you have a good income, so like this was typically
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:01.540]   thinking about people in their 20s but who were computer programmers, for example.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:07.900]   If you could live on 25% of your income and save 75%, the math works out so that after
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:14.980]   I forgot what it was like 10 years or 15 years, you'll have saved enough money that that 25%
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.260]   you were living on, you can now just withdraw that from your savings into perpetuity.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.660]   So in theory, you could retire.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:24.500]   Obviously, it doesn't quite work out because your cost of living goes up, and also you
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.580]   don't want to live on a fraction of your income or whatever.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.120]   But the cool thing about the FIRE community and that article in particular is it'll just
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:37.100]   expand your mind a little bit in terms of what it means to save, right?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.600]   That saving could mean I'm putting 30% of my income away, like you don't have to spend
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:49.120]   every dollar, that it could be very aggressive, or that maybe at first you do a savings ladder,
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.480]   or at first my income's not great, so I just symbolically I'm saving 5%.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:59.840]   But then after I get to a certain place, like okay, I'm getting raises, but I don't really
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.780]   need to change much about my quality of life right now, I'm just going to put the whole
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.200]   raise into the automatic saving, or I'm going to do a 50/50 thing.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.840]   Every raise, 50% of that is going to be automatically saved, and the other 50% brings up my quality
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   of living.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.020]   So my quality of life goes up, but I'm actually over time as my income raises, soon the percentage
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:20.280]   of my income that I'm saving is really high, but I'm still getting the benefit of making
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.180]   more money because I'm still raising my quality of life.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.280]   It opens up all of this sort of creative thinking about how aggressively one could save, and
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.440]   how cheaply one could potentially live.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.480]   The final knob to turn here is make more money as quickly as possible, especially in your
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:41.880]   20s, where I know we talk a lot about hustle culture being bad right now, but the one time
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.240]   of your life where actually hustling might make sense is you have nothing else to do
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   in your 24.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.360]   I mean, that's probably not the worst thing.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.260]   Is it really better if you've escaped hustle culture so that you can play three hours of
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.260]   Call of Duty a night?
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.400]   I don't know, maybe hustling more and making more money in your 20s is a better use of
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   that time.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.040]   So I put that out there.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.960]   So if you want to make more money, check out my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.000]   The central idea in there is get good at stuff that matters.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.300]   No one cares about how valuable you think you are.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.960]   No one cares about your scheme that you want to work.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.080]   No one cares that you read the four-hour work week and are convinced that if you could just
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.440]   set up a drop shifter to send striped French sailor shirts to people around the world and
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.720]   you put the right Google AdSense ads, you're going to be making a fortune automatically.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.760]   No one cares that that's what you want to do.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.320]   Get unambiguously good at things that matter by training like an athlete trains to get
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.500]   better at their sport.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.320]   And that's the quickest way to raise your value in the marketplace.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.360]   And having more money allows you to save more, right?
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.240]   So those are the books I would have-- I mean, that was my thinking in the 20s.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.920]   Those are my influences, and that's what I would recommend.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.360]   What I did-- I don't know if I'd recommend this.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.240]   So I put all of my eggs, my financial eggs, in the writing basket.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:00.320]   I said, OK, after college, I had a fair amount of student debt, right?
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.500]   And I went to grads to get my doctorate.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:09.480]   So if you're going to grad school, you can defer paying your student debt back.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.440]   But it still accrues interest.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.760]   So every year, you spend-- if you're getting your doctorate in the sciences, it's not like
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.200]   you have to pay money to go to school.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.920]   They pay you a stipend, but it's small.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.880]   That debt raises every year.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.860]   It doubled for me, basically, in the time I was in grad school.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:32.200]   But here was my gamble, right, because I turned down lucrative-- I was a star computer science
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   student.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.800]   I turned down lucrative tech jobs.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.520]   My gamble was, as a grad student, and then if I succeed in this and become a professor,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.680]   I will still be able to write.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:46.040]   It's a world in which people write books, right?
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.800]   I want to become a successful writer.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.260]   Writing scales.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.640]   The same amount of effort goes into writing a book that sells few copies that went into
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.240]   writing Atomic Habits.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.000]   So you have this sort of uncapped up end.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.560]   It's not trading your hours for money.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.880]   You have this untapped sort of upper end.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:11.920]   I said, OK, I'm going to take this risk that I will accrue this debt as I'm making, like,
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.680]   no money as a grad student onwards to a professorship job that's also not going to be super lucrative.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.160]   I mean, it's going to take a long time to pay back this debt, you know, starting as,
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.560]   like, an assistant professor.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.880]   But I am going to guess that the flexibility-- this gives me the ability to write.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.200]   I'm going to put all my eggs in that writing basket that this is going to-- I will become
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.040]   successful enough that this will all be moot.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   That happened.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.760]   But, man, that was a risky gamble.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.420]   That was probably a risky gamble.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.680]   I remember it happened-- my fourth book, like, right as I was leaving my postdoc, the deal
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.480]   for my fourth book was, like, my first real book deal.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:55.760]   And that allowed us to, like, buy a car, spent $18,000 on a Honda Fit Sport, which we just
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   sold this year.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   Really?
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   Just sold it this year.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   It's a great car.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:06.160]   We have three kids, and we need to use both of our cars for transporting.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.080]   So we finally-- we sold it and got a-- we have a plug-in hybrid.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.840]   And in DC, like, you can't drive distance.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.520]   Like, you're just in-- you could drive a long time, but you can't drive distance, so it's
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.600]   all electric, basically, and it's bigger, and we can fit the kids or whatever.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.880]   It was end of an era, though.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.880]   Sold that.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   So I could-- we bought-- this is true.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.480]   We bought that car for $18,000.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.600]   We bought a Tempur-Pedic mattress for $2,000.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.540]   We're like, whoa, this is the big thing.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.080]   And then, more importantly, it was the down payment for our first house, right?
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.480]   But I still had the debt, which I had to start paying, but, like, it allowed me to sort of
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.280]   get on my feet in a way that-- I don't know how I would have done any of those things
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   coming out of grad school.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.380]   You know, I just wouldn't have had the money.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:53.000]   And then when deep work started doing well, then it was-- it wasn't until then that I
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.400]   was able to actually pay off the student loan debt, and we could move to a new house and
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   pay that largely off.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:07.320]   And it worked out finally, but not till 2000, probably like six years out of grad school.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.040]   So that was a risk.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.760]   So I would not recommend, Timmy, just write a book that sells a couple million copies.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.720]   And then that does simplify things, but that was my gamble.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.240]   The advice I'm giving you here, I think, is probably more replicatable.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.800]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.680]   Next question's from Lauren.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.260]   I'm a lawyer with expertise in legal writing.
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.600]   I'm interested in writing a nonfiction book that's relevant to my field.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.880]   I took your advice and met with a book agent who delivered some news I didn't want to hear.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:43.200]   For debut nonfiction authors nowadays, agents and publishers want an existing social media
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.680]   audience of 10,000 to 20,000 followers.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.040]   I don't have any desire to engage online.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.720]   That's not a hard and fast rule.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.640]   So here's what you need.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.880]   You need a book idea that there's a sizable audience that's going to feel like, I have
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.680]   to read this.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.760]   You have to be the right person to be writing that book.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.800]   It makes sense that you're writing it.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.680]   And you have to be a non-bad writer.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.560]   So you have to be able to write well enough that it's not going to be a liability.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.240]   It'll be publishable.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.680]   If you have those three things, there is a place for your book.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.540]   Remember, agents are desperate to sell books.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.920]   Publishers are desperate to buy and publish books.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.900]   They have to keep their pipeline full.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.900]   They want good stuff.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.000]   And if there's something that really meets that criteria, they want it.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.040]   They do not want to be the ones who are like, I missed out on that because you didn't have
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.800]   10,000 social media followers.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.200]   10,000 social media followers aren't going to do anything.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.720]   It's not going to sell a lot of books.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.080]   Conversion rates on social media is very low.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.280]   If you have a sizable email list following, that matters.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   Sure.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   That does matter.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:51.040]   If you have a large YouTube following, that can help as well, though not necessarily.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.820]   But that can be pretty useful as well.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.500]   Those are two very hard things to get.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.640]   You're not, probably not as a, you're a lawyer?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   What is this?
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   I mean, good luck.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.120]   You would have to have a very specific angle and point of view with an original idea that
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.840]   like build up that audience.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.440]   So I don't think that's realistic.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.280]   So you basically just have to find an agent that doesn't think you need that.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.340]   And again, the way you convince the agent you don't really need that is the quality
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.340]   of the idea.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.080]   So probably what's happening here is you have an idea that's like, yeah, like this makes
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.120]   sense for a book.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.160]   You know, some people will buy this.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.660]   It's not going to be a big bestseller.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:33.760]   It doesn't have this like energy of like, this is going to be a big thing.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.160]   Books are in that sort of meh territory.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.480]   Sometimes publishers, I guess, are thinking, well, at the very least, we want you to sell
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.920]   this to your own audience.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   Like, we want to know at least you're going to sell 500 copies to like your 20,000, whatever,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.880]   so that we can like make back minimal money.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.480]   But you don't want to be playing that game anyways.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.200]   If that's the game you're playing with your book, it's not worth taking the time to write
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.080]   the book.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.520]   So if the idea is good enough, people will want to publish it.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520]   And they don't care.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   I mean, have a good marketing plan.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.200]   You should be like, here's all the podcasts I'm going to go on.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.440]   Here's all the people I'm going to reach out to who I think would like this book, whose
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   audience...
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.680]   Talk about all the audiences that exist that you are going to engage with, even if they're
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   not yours.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.560]   But if the idea is good, you shouldn't need that minor audience.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.120]   And if the idea is good, and an agent says you do, talk to some other agents.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120]   I mean, I don't have social media.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.940]   That's not really fair, because I do have a lot of email followers.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.920]   But man, I have not...
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.980]   The most successful books sell because something about the idea hits the timing right.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:36.000]   The most useful thing that social media can offer your book is other people's channels
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.400]   talking about it.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.200]   Your own audience converting to book sales is...
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.980]   Look, if you want to make money off your own audience, sell them a product.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.440]   Good books spread, bad books don't.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.400]   Mediocre books go somewhere in the middle.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   That's just how that works.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.760]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.120]   We have our Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.120]   All right.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.760]   Let's hear some theme music.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.360]   All right, so people don't know.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.960]   We have one question each week that is based on my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.880]   Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.040]   All right, what's our Slow Productivity Corner question of the week, Jesse?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.040]   It's from Don.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:20.080]   "I will return to the office five days a week in 2025 and will have about 90 minutes total
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   commute time.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.560]   I want to start the year off with your audio books.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:28.520]   Do you recommend reading your books in chronological order or some other way?"
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.520]   I see them...
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.200]   Well, it's more of a series plus one-offs.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.600]   So assuming you're not interested in the student books, I think of Deep Work, A World Without
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:42.800]   Email and Slow Productivity as a coherent trilogy that is confronting knowledge work
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.360]   in the age of digital technology.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.600]   So that's like my work, tech and culture work trilogy.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.000]   Digital minimalism is standalone.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.800]   Technology in your own life, your personal life, your phone.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.080]   So good they can't ignore you, sort of standalone.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.000]   It's about thinking, rethinking how one cultivates a career that they really like.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.520]   So the order in which you read or where you read those two books doesn't matter.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.720]   But Deep Work, Too Email, Too Slow Productivity, that is a coherent sequence and they're all
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.920]   dealing with the same topic.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.200]   A couple other pieces of advice I want to give you though, because you have like a semi-sizeable
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   commute here.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.920]   I mean, not by DC standards, but 45 minutes each way.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.520]   Consider also audio courses.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.120]   You get like masterclass or great courses where you can listen to them.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.680]   You can get through quite a few courses over the course of a year if you're systematically
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.200]   using your commute.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.920]   One hack there is use dictation.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.960]   So like voice dictation, like on your phone, for example, to sort of take notes or summarize
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.320]   what you just learned on the fly.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.120]   Like I listened for 20 minutes and I'm going to dictate a summary notes of this and then
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.720]   collect those notes when you get to your office and put them in like some sort of shared document.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.960]   You want to summarize in your own words what you're learning immediately and then have
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.220]   a place you hold that all.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.360]   That's how you actually learn from these courses.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   The other thing I would recommend you consider if you have a commute of this length is using
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.440]   the afternoon commute as office hours.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   Consider it's when I am in the car from 5 to 545, five days a week.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:16.400]   Leverage that to minimize to the degree possible unscheduled back and forth messaging both
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.780]   within work and home.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.720]   So if there's like something, hey, it's like a work colleague who wants to like catch up
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.360]   or has a question to run by me, you just say, "Great.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.360]   Call me.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.940]   I'm always in my car from 5 to 545 whenever you want.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:29.940]   Just call me.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.940]   It's a great time to reach me.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:31.940]   We'll chat.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:32.940]   We'll figure it out."
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.100]   Same thing like text messages are coming in during the day.
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:39.040]   It's like your cousin wants to work out like some plan for an upcoming reunion or whatever.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.040]   Like, "Yeah.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.040]   5 to 545.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   Just call me any day you want.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   I'm here."
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.040]   Right?
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.040]   "Love to catch up.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   Call me."
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:51.360]   You'd be surprised how car commute office hours, how much otherwise distracting unscheduled
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.240]   messaging gets deferred and also how much more you talk to people because now you could
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.000]   actually like say, "Hey, I'd love to catch up.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.280]   Call me," in a way that you wouldn't do if you actually had to schedule that call into
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.880]   a specific slot.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   This is an idea.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.420]   I gave it to Chris Yeh.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.320]   This was his idea from years back, and I think it's a great idea.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.840]   So take advantage.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.760]   If you have the commute, let's take advantage of it.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:17.280]   Also make sure you do a, if you're in the office five days a week, make sure you do
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.120]   a really great shutdown ritual at the end of each day.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:25.200]   Put aside 15 minutes to do a good shutdown ritual so that that car ride home is not just
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.440]   a physical transformation location but a psychological transformation as well.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.240]   I've closed the loops and in that drive as I'm taking my calls or listening to my audiobook,
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:40.520]   my mind transitions away from work and then you're going to get home and there's a refreshed
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.160]   like at-home mindset you can lean into there.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   All right.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.240]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.240]   We do.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   All right.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.240]   Let's hear it.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   Hi.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.240]   My name is Jeff Amon.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:56:00.800]   I'm a lawyer in the Tampa Bay area in Lutz, Florida, and I'm a big fan of the podcast
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.080]   and all of your work, Kyle.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.600]   I've been reading your books.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:13.760]   I think I've read all of them but the college book at this point, but one of the references
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:20.320]   you made in the podcast was to a book called The Intellectual Life that you stumbled across
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   in the library in the stacks.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:31.440]   I think it was as an undergrad but I've been reading that book and I'm also trying to transition.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:37.120]   I'm 65 and going to wind down my law practice.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:44.280]   What am I going to focus on in terms of retirement, interested in writing and a few other things
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   but he says, "Do not be ashamed not to know what you could only know at the cost of scattering
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.560]   your attention."
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:04.960]   And then later in that chapter, "Know what you have resolved to know, cast a glance at
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.880]   the rest."
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:15.280]   And so, given the call to the deep life, which is really what you're asking of us, which
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:26.960]   is a great call, for someone like me who's transitioning away from a career in the law,
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:36.160]   what should I be doing to think about what area that I want to focus in and cast a glance
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.840]   at the other stuff?
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   Thanks.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.320]   Appreciate it.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:49.400]   Well, I think the argument in The Intellectual Life is that there is deeply human value in
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:54.920]   the focused intellectual pursuit itself and this is to some degree agnostic from content.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:01.000]   So, I think that the argument there would be what he's trying to say there is pick something
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.720]   that seems interesting and meaningful and get into that intellectually and don't sweat
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.440]   all the other stuff that you're missing.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.360]   Don't sweat, "But I don't know about this or that or this," because there is an endless
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.840]   universe of ideas that you could be exposing yourself and learning and you don't have enough
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.280]   time to do all of them.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:26.360]   So, get the enjoyment out of, "I am intellectually engaged with something," and that's a cool
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   book.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   I talk about that book in Deep Work.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.200]   I found that in the stacks at Georgetown, actually, because I think it's a Catholic
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   thinker.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   He might even be a Dominican.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   I'll look it up.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   Yeah, look it up.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   Stern Tillingsy.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   I always say his name wrong.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.560]   But anyways, I found that in the stacks at Georgetown.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.560]   What's cool about that book is that he talks about The Intellectual Life as just an aspirational
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.760]   goal and he gets really practical about it.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.880]   How do you build a life of the mind?
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.840]   He gets into details, like what's it like reading?
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.160]   What's it like reading hard things?
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.000]   How do you figure out what it is that you want to read?
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   It's a cool...
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.240]   There's not enough books like that, so I highly recommend it.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:11.760]   But again, I think the point there is, use your mind in deep ways and you will be happier.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.680]   This matches the type of advice I give.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.440]   Think about my reading advice.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   I read a lot, but I don't sweat too much what I read.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.780]   What am I in the mood for?
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.780]   What's interesting?
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.400]   I follow weird flights of fancy.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.840]   I don't have a concern of I got to read the right things, the new things, or the things
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:31.820]   that everyone else is reading, because the enjoyment is out of the intellectual engagement
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:37.760]   as much as it is any particular thing that you're engaging with.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.760]   That's cool.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.760]   The Intellectual Life.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:40.760]   I like that book.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.760]   I always say the guy's name wrong.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   Sir Talanges.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.560]   Sir Talanges, which can't be how you pronounce that.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.880]   Sir Talanges, Sir Talanges.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   Insidious?
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.320]   It's an insidious name.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.060]   I said insidious right there, I guess.
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.060]   You said it right.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.060]   Insidious.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.060]   You actually said it right there.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.880]   I'm sure we'll look it up and our readers will tell us that you pronounce that name
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.880]   Smith.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.580]   Just the pronunciation is wrong.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.480]   We got a case study here.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.980]   That's where people write in to talk about their personal experience applying the type
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.880]   of advice that we talked about on the show.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.400]   Today's case study comes from Jonathan.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.560]   Jonathan says, "I was feeling very cognitively overloaded last month.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.040]   I took inspiration from slow productivity and deep work and decided to detox digitally
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.820]   for the last two months of 2024.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:32.320]   I deleted all social media apps from my phone and resolved not to check social media at
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.800]   all until 2025, a vow I have maintained.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.280]   It's so much easier to do it with the apps deleted.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.520]   Since doing so, I'm no longer viewing my phone as a source of entertainment.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.160]   A number of things have happened.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.680]   I'm much more focused when working.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.640]   I started a major project to revise and relaunch part of my business in January.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.800]   I've been finishing books at a rapid pace.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.760]   I started studying Dutch.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.340]   Physically, I do not feel tired and overloaded anymore.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:02.720]   My sleep has improved, my mind is clearer, and I'm much happier without constant reminders
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.160]   about the state of the world.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.520]   But here's the problem.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.200]   I depend on LinkedIn, the prospect for new clients for my business.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.280]   It is without question the best method I've found to market my business.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.980]   I cannot stay off LinkedIn forever and need to get back in on January.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.440]   My relaunch requires it.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.800]   However, given the peace of mind and productivity I've experienced in the last month, I'm absolutely
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.280]   dreading going back on LinkedIn, even though I will not download the apps to my phone again
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.540]   and have decided to limit social media use to my computer in the future.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:33.320]   What advice do you have for going back on social media, a necessary evil, without sacrificing
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.640]   the happiness and productivity I've gained by eliminating social media from my life over
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   the last two months?
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:43.400]   Well, first of all, Jonathan, I love that example, that testimony about how much is
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:50.280]   gained when you're not using social media on your phone is a default response to boredom.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.200]   We tell ourselves it's not that big of a problem.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.100]   It's important to stay up on the news and you meet interesting people and it's kind
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.640]   of cool to be connected.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.200]   But it's like the problem drinker who doesn't really realize till she or he stops how much
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.400]   you're actually losing with his behavior.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.880]   So see all the positive stuff that happened when Jonathan took these apps off of his phone.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.840]   He is reading, he's exercising, he's doing projects on the side, he's reading books faster
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   than he ever has before.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   I think it's all fantastic.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.200]   So Jonathan, what do you do about LinkedIn?
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:25.400]   You're basically all the way there, access it on your computer, have a schedule three
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.920]   times a week, twice a week, 15 minutes at a time.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   This is what you do.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.200]   You like, I don't know what you do on LinkedIn, but like you have to post an article three
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.400]   times a week so people are keeping up with you or check in on messages that are people
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.400]   saying to you.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.960]   You got to treat it like taking out the garbage.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.240]   I do it 15 minutes, I do it on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I do it right after lunch.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.560]   It's not going to push you back to where you were before because the thing that kills us
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.400]   about social media is when it begins to mediate our life, like when it's constantly there,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.800]   when we never go more than a few minutes without seeing it.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.880]   That's where our life begins to blend with the digital.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.920]   That's when our ability to do other things begins to degrade.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.840]   Going onto your computer three times a week for 10 minutes to check for LinkedIn DMs is
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.080]   not going to bring that all back.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.240]   Just keep the fences around that super, super high.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.100]   That's a key idea for my book, Digital Minimalism.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.280]   When you know why you're using a technology, you could put really high fences around it
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.400]   and the damage is minimized.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.720]   So if you know I'm using LinkedIn to do exactly this, you could put up these high fences.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.080]   It's three times a week, it's 10 minutes and that's it.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.080]   And none of the other social apps get access back to you, none of the other apps get back
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   on your phone.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   I think you'll be fine, Jonathan.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.880]   Don't worry, you're not about to go back to a world of constant distraction and all the
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.040]   harm that causes by just having a carefully fenced LinkedIn habit.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.640]   All right, so we've got a cool tech corner coming up next, but first I want to talk about
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.640]   another sponsor.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.920]   If you're hearing this show, it's either right before New Year's or it's right after.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.320]   If it's right after, maybe you're still shaking off a bit of a rough morning and if it's right
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.520]   before, maybe you're thinking, "Man, what could I do to not have a rough morning on
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]   New Year's Day?"
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.440]   Well, here I want to tell you about a game-changing project you can use the night before a night
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.440]   out with drinks.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.920]   It's called pre-alcohol.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.560]   Let's face it, after a night out with a few celebratory drinks, if you're like me who's
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:21.280]   not exactly a spring chicken anymore, you might not bounce back as quick as you used
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.640]   to.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.280]   This is where pre-alcohol enters the scene.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.200]   Here's how it works.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   Pre-alcohol probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.480]   It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   Here's how it works.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.480]   When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic by-product in the gut.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:47.760]   It's this by-product, not dehydration, that's to blame for your rough next day.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.040]   Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this by-product down.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.520]   Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.040]   Drink responsibly and you'll feel your best tomorrow.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:04.080]   We're recording this before the holidays, so I will, for sure, have my Z-Biotics ready
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.240]   for New Year's Eve.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:13.280]   You can have a bit of that celebratory champagne without having that next day groan.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.200]   It's nice to find a way to keep a few of those pleasures in life and minimize some of the
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   aftereffects.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.200]   Cool product.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.200]   Smart idea.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.900]   Look, this holiday season is not just upon me, it's upon you, too.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.880]   I know I'm going to be consuming a bit more alcohol than usual.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.400]   You probably will be, too.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.000]   With that pre-alcohol, we'll all stay on track to be our deepest.

[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   off.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.480]   All right, let's go to our final segment.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:04.720]   I'm going to do a tech corner here, take a kind of technology topic and get into it a
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.960]   little bit.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:12.700]   There's a newsletter post from Ted Gioia's The Honest Broker sub-stack that's been going
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.700]   around the internet.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.200]   It's been getting some discussion.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.000]   It's been going a little bit viral.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   Here's the title of this post.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.120]   I have it on the screen here for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.960]   The title of this essay, which was posted December 12th, like a week ago when I'm recording
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:35.480]   this, "Are Social Media Platforms the Next Dying Malls?"
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:42.840]   What Ted does in this article is he argues that the trajectory of shopping malls is perhaps
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:49.280]   the trajectory that we're going to see or are seeing already unfold for social media.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.840]   He gives these points, which I'm going to summarize real quickly, for the ways in which
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:59.640]   these social media platforms are like the ugly malls that expanded greatly in the '80s
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.280]   and have been closing down at a rapid clip in the 2000s.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.160]   Reason number one, people go there because other people go there, but this is a fragile
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.540]   foundation for a community.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.720]   This was the case about malls, like, "Oh, that's where people are, so I want to go to
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.700]   the malls because that's where my friends are."
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.540]   This is what seems to be happening with social media platforms as well.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:26.140]   Their main argument for a lot of these platforms, Ted is saying, is just everyone is using this,
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.240]   so you should use it as well.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.060]   That didn't work out so well for the malls, and he argues that might not work out so well
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.560]   for social media.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:38.100]   Point number two, malls died because there are too many of them.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:43.320]   Social media is now entering that same phase.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:47.940]   He talks about how once malls over expanded, they began to close down.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.540]   He says the same thing is now happening in social media, where "hundreds or thousands
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.300]   of platforms compete for community members and more get launched every month."
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.300]   Ted says, "People keep telling me that I need to move on the threads or Blue Sky or Twitch
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:05.860]   or TikTok or Discord or True Social or Snapchat or Rumble or YouTube Shorts or whatever.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.720]   I've set up profiles on some of these platforms, but then sooner or later, I just walk away.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.840]   Who has the time to post on all of these apps?"
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.360]   His next argument is malls started to look identical with the same merchandise, tenants,
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]   architecture, and ambiance.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.320]   It's kind of made a little bit depressing and non-exciting to go to.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.680]   He's saying now we're seeing this on social media as well.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.120]   Ted writes, "In the last three years, social media platforms have started converging, imitating
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.560]   the endless scroll of TikTok."
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.960]   Number four, he says, "Many malls like social media platforms become magnets for lurkers,
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.160]   losers, and toxic behavior of all sorts, and this made community building impossible."
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.260]   Clearly, we see that in social media.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.680]   And finally, he says, "These bunkers were never real communities and never will be.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.640]   They're just businesses, often run with distrust or contempt for their users."
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.320]   And that's true.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.680]   Social media is not a philanthropic community town square, virtual town hall, or whatever
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.680]   people call it.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.600]   It's a moneymaking venture.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.040]   And because of that, it's not really meant to be a true community.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   All right.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.780]   So that was a cool argument.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.000]   That went around a lot.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.880]   There's like 186 comments on this and thousands of likes.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:19.080]   On the other side, our friend Michael Easter, who was featured in an in-depth episode just
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.960]   a couple weeks ago, he wrote in his newsletter a response to this, right?
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.480]   And he says, "Gioia compares social media to shopping malls, arguing that social media
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.640]   will become like shopping malls, irrelevant and dead, but I respectfully disagree with
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   him."
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.240]   And then he goes on to give his three reasons why.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.200]   One, social media is on us 24/7, not a place we physically visit.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.320]   Two, social media is engineered to give us what we individually respond to.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.480]   Malls are not.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.440]   Three, malls have fewer, slower, random, and unpredictable rewards, whereas social media
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.120]   is much better at triggering what Easter calls our scarcity loop, and it's much more sort
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.760]   of addictively appealing.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.880]   All right.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.280]   So Easter concludes, "For these reasons, I think the closest physical location comparison
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.720]   to social media is casinos, and casinos and gambling are here to stay."
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.720]   All right.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.800]   So that's an interesting debate.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:23.360]   For social media, is it more like malls, or is it more like casinos?
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:30.720]   So I'm thinking, I thought about this, I don't see why both of these aren't right.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.760]   I think Ted Gioia's points are right.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:41.440]   Like, these are things that make social media not nearly as important as it claims to be.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.880]   His points, I think, argue why social media is not as central to our culture and experience
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:52.800]   as its proponents like to say, or how everyone believed 10 years ago, that it is more fragile
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.240]   and arbitrary, right?
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:01.040]   It's fake community, it has all these toxic elements, there's a lot of it, it's all starting
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.720]   to look the same, we don't have a good reason to be there other than it seems to be the
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.880]   place where everyone was, we're just there because everyone says it needs to be there.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:15.920]   Where Easter's points come in, is I think this is what is keeping people from leaving
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.360]   even faster than they are, that you have this nice addictive reward element.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.960]   So really, I think the right way to think about this is not, is it a casino or is it
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.240]   a mall, but it's like, it's a mall where they added slot machines, and there's people who
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:35.120]   are doing those slot machines as they're there, so even as the model is kind of dying, it's
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.600]   propping them up, or it's what's keeping them alive, or it's drawing out that death a little
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.600]   bit longer.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.280]   So they do have a casino-like flavor, but I mean, I guess the difference is people go
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.540]   to casinos to go to a casino, I want to gamble, it's fun, I like the chance of winning money.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.260]   People tell themselves they're going to social media for very different reasons, and it's
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:57.680]   the more implicit casino factor that keeps them there.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.640]   And that's why I think both of these things are true, people are realizing the thing I
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.920]   think social media is, it's not, and I'm really just around because it's secretly a casino,
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.640]   but I didn't sign up to go to a casino, I wanted to go hang out at the community where
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.560]   my friends were.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.940]   And so I think both are true.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:17.080]   What Easter is talking about is slowing down the death of social media, but the flaws that
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.160]   you're going to talk about I think are there, and they're becoming more aware, and I do
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.860]   think I've written about this before in The New Yorker and elsewhere, I do think the age
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.440]   of the dominance of the major social media platforms is over, just people don't realize
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.600]   it yet, it's on the downslope, we just haven't realized it yet.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.600]   Cool debate though.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:38.200]   Do you, in terms of the casino, does that carry over to drafting apps and stuff like
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   that?
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   Hell yeah.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.840]   I mean those are, that's like more explicitly that.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.920]   It's like, I want to bet money to see if I can make more money.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.440]   Well it is and it isn't because they're hearing it all the time now, like for instance, the
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.280]   ads are on sporting games all the time, like in-game betting.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   It's like a casino.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.840]   So it's kind of like, it's in the back of their brain and they're just hearing it, and
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.840]   then they just might, you know.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.720]   It's like a casino that you're allowed to put on a phone.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.160]   Like I think that's, I mean that's actually playing with a money scarcity loop where like,
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.280]   I want to make more money, I want to turn my money into more money.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.600]   And sometimes it does and it's, yeah.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.040]   I mean that, that's emerging by the way is, for techno critics, that's emerging as like,
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   this might have been a mistake.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.240]   Like giving everyone access to a casino on their phone, that's going to create a lot
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   of problems.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.560]   Like it's kind of the equivalent as if you built major casinos in every single town and
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.560]   just like constantly, like they're just everywhere, like set the gas, come by the casino, come
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.560]   by the casino.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.840]   You're going to have a lot more problems when like everyone is around a casino all the time.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.640]   So yeah, it's interesting what's going on out there.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.920]   Anyways, cool discussion, cool tech corner.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.880]   So we're back in it, New Year's.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.840]   Back to our normal episode rhythm, we got some good in-depth we're working on as well,
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.920]   so we'll see some more of those Thursday episodes as well sporadically as the New Year unfolds.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:58.480]   This is our last episode of 2024, so we will see you all in 2025, we'll do the books next
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480]   week.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.480]   So I'll see you then.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.520]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.440]   Hey, if you enjoyed today's episode and maybe you want to think a little bit more about
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:13.600]   the deep life writ large, check out episode 314 about the elements of the deep life.
