[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.020]   Mike is a CPA, and he's the author of many finance and tax-related books.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.580]   In fact, more than he can even count, but he's got these wonderful small books
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.320]   that are written in a really straightforward way.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.540]   He does such a great job of communicating just what you need to get something figured out.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.160]   He has also developed the website Open Social Security, and I think in a lot of ways
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.840]   that website epitomizes Mike's approach to what he does
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.100]   where he is creating this open source program, and it's just there to be helpful.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.320]   It's a free tool.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800]   He's not selling it, and it's a wonderful, wonderful resource.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360]   So if you're trying to figure out Social Security, trying to get a second opinion
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.280]   on Social Security, definitely check out Open Social Security.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.100]   He's here to discuss Social Security and tax planning matters before and during retirement.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140]   So please join me in welcoming Mike.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.140]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.240]   >> Thanks, Christine.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.300]   Sorry. I don't know who this is.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.280]   I'm just worried about, you know, tripping on it, making a mess.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.300]   All right.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.720]   So when clients come to me, and they're in this window of years, either shortly before retiring
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.120]   or shortly after retiring, they come to me with a list of questions on which they want my input,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.180]   and there are three questions that show up on that list almost every single time.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.320]   There we go.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.360]   The first question is, when should I file for Social Security, as you might imagine.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.660]   Second question is, should I be doing Roth conversions?
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.200]   They've heard that Roth conversions might be advantageous during retirement,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.520]   but they don't know whether that applies to them specifically.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.000]   And the third question is, which accounts should I spend from every year?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.780]   All right.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.100]   Let's say you want to spend $90,000 this year.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.060]   Should it come out of your traditional IRA, Roth IRA, taxable brokerage accounts?
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.540]   How do you figure it out?
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.980]   So we're just going to go through these one by one today.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.680]   When should I file for Social Security?
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.420]   There are three big factors that you should make sure to include in this decision.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.800]   The first factor is actuarial math.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.660]   So this is just math based on life expectancies.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.860]   Then we have longevity risk.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.800]   That's the risk of outliving your money, right?
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.560]   If you live for a very long retirement, you're more likely
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.540]   to deplete your portfolio during your lifetime.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.760]   And then we have tax planning.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.060]   So starting with actuarial math, this is exactly what Open Social Security does,
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.120]   and the idea here is we're just asking which filing age, or if you're married,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.780]   which combination of filing ages, would be expected to provide the greatest total amount
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.480]   of benefits over your lifetime, or actually slightly more precisely what we're asking is
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   which filing age is expected to provide the greatest present value of total benefits.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.620]   So we're accounting for the fact that the dollar that you receive sooner is more valuable
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.780]   than the dollar that you receive later due to A, inflation, and B,
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.300]   the fact that the sooner you have a dollar in your hands, the sooner you can invest it.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540]   And this is exactly what Open Social Security does.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.540]   It just takes the inputs that you give it, takes the mortality assumptions that you give it,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.820]   and it figures out which filing age or combination of filing ages is expected
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.500]   to maximize your spending power over your lifetime.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.640]   And when we do that math, what we typically see for an unmarried person, and we're starting
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.580]   with that analysis because that's the simpler one, and then we'll move
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.200]   on to the analysis for a married couple, we typically see that it makes sense to wait
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.780]   until age 70, or in some cases, file a little bit before age 70.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.260]   And the reason that this is how the math works out, to understand it,
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.660]   it can help to back up a step and to talk about when the current version
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.280]   of the rules were first created.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.100]   So the rules that say that as you wait however many months,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.080]   your benefit goes up by this much percent every month.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.600]   The idea was that the system would be actuarially neutral,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.860]   meaning that any one filing age was supposed to be about as good as any other filing age,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.280]   because as you wait, your benefit goes up, but that would be offset by the fact
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.320]   that you're receiving that benefit for a smaller number of months.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.400]   So that's the idea.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.180]   It was supposed to be actuarially neutral.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.500]   But the reality is that today, it no longer is, and that's because the rules didn't change,
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.280]   but the world did change.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.040]   Specifically, life expectancies have gone up, and that pushes the math in favor of waiting.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.000]   Because the longer you live, the better it works out to have waited to file for your benefit.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.600]   Right? Because your benefit lasts your whole life, so if you live for a very long life,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.860]   it would be good to have a larger social security benefit.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.640]   So this shifts the math in that direction.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.060]   But there are exceptions, right?
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.100]   There are cases in which an unmarried person should go ahead and file early.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.580]   The obvious one is somebody in poor health, right?
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.260]   If you're 62 and you're trying to figure out whether to make this decision,
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.840]   if you already have a diagnosis that says you're only supposed to live to age 65,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.600]   you shouldn't wait until age 70 to file for your benefit.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.840]   Then we have, if you have a minor child or an adult disabled child,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   your child can receive benefits on your work record, but not until you have filed
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.160]   for your retirement benefit, so that can be a point in favor of filing earlier
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.920]   so that your child can get those benefits starting at an earlier time.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.600]   And whenever real interest rates are high, so real interest rates meaning inflation adjusted
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.540]   interest rates like we see on TIPS, whenever those are high,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.620]   that makes filing early relatively more advantageous, right?
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.960]   Because the idea is that the take the money and invest it strategy, it becomes more attractive
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.340]   when you know you can get a better return.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:02.560]   Now when we move on to the decision for a married couple, what we typically see,
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.000]   the life expectancy math showing us, is that the higher earner should wait until age 70,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.660]   and the lower earner should file somewhat earlier, not necessarily ASAP at age 62,
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.640]   but somewhat before 70, and the reason for that has to do with the way that survivor benefits work.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.040]   Basically as soon as either person dies,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.640]   the surviving spouse continues receiving the larger of the two benefit amounts.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.980]   That's the smaller of the two benefit amounts that goes away.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.660]   And so what this means is that when the higher earner waits to file,
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.940]   it increases the household income as long as either person is still living
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.840]   or until both people have died.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.600]   So for example, if you consider myself and my spouse, if you imagine that when we reach age 62,
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.000]   if at that point in time I'm the one with the higher earnings record, if I wait to file,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.800]   that increases my retirement benefit, and that's relevant for as long as I'm alive.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.940]   But if I die first, and she outlives me, her benefit as my survivor will be increased due
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.080]   to the fact that I waited, so when the higher earner waits,
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.020]   it increases the household income while either person is still living.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.460]   Now when the lower earner waits, it's kind of the opposite situation.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.120]   It only increases the household income for as long as both people are still living.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.340]   So again, in this example, if you take my spouse, if she waits to file for her retirement benefit,
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.840]   if she's the lower earner at that time, then that will increase her retirement benefit.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.140]   But then if she dies first, that increased benefit is no longer relevant.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.400]   And if I die first, she would start receiving a benefit as my survivor.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.940]   So again, the fact that she waited is no longer relevant.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:49.860]   And the key point here is that while either person is still alive is a longer length of time
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.120]   than while both people are still alive.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.340]   So when the higher earner waits, it increases the household income for a longer length of time.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:06.820]   Sorry, just a very thirsty speaker.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:14.000]   All right, now what we can do, this is an illustrative concept, we can think about all
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.460]   of the possible mortality outcomes and group them into four categories.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.060]   We have the first corner, where both people live beyond their life expectancy.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.880]   And in the opposite corner, we've got the opposite case,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.280]   where both people died before reaching their life expectancy.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.400]   And then we have the case where spouse A dies before reaching their life expectancy
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.200]   and spouse B lives past their life expectancy, and the opposite case.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   So for the higher earner's filing decision, what we want to know is how long will it be
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.140]   until both people have died?
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.920]   Or another way that we can ask that question is how likely is it
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.040]   that at least one person lives past their life expectancy?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.580]   Because if at least one person lives past their life expectancy,
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.140]   then it will have been a good thing for that higher earner to have waited.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.800]   So in which of these four cases does at least one person live past their life expectancy?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.040]   We've got this one where they both do, this one where spouse B does.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.180]   Sorry, a bit of a delay with the clicker here.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.800]   And this one where spouse A does.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.200]   So in other words, there's about a three out of four chance
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.240]   that at least one person lives past their life expectancy.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.000]   And that's why it's generally a good idea for that higher earner to wait to file.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.600]   But then when we look at the decision for the lower earner,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.860]   now we have to ask the opposite question.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.040]   How likely is it that at least one person dies early before reaching their life expectancy?
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.500]   Because if that happens, at least one person dies early, then it will have been advantageous
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.840]   for that lower earner to file early.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.280]   So in which of these four cases does at least one person die early?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.440]   Well, these three.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.340]   Every case other than the one in which they both live past their life expectancy, right?
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.680]   So there's about a three out of four chance that at least one person dies before reaching their life
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.240]   expectancy, and that's why it's generally advantageous for that lower earner to file earlier.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.860]   And that's why we get this rough draft plan, where the higher earner waits until age 70,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.020]   and the lower earner files somewhat earlier.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.200]   But again, there are exceptions.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.440]   There's the case in which you have a minor child or adult disabled child, same idea as before.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.660]   That can be a point in favor of the higher earner filing earlier so that
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.380]   that child can receive child benefits on that person's work record,
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.720]   starting at an earlier point in time.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   There's the case where the lower earner is younger than full retirement age
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.120]   and still working, then we have to concern ourselves with the social security earnings test,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.220]   which we're not going to get into all of the rules, but it's a compelling point in favor
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.600]   of that lower earner waiting at least until the year they reach full retirement age
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.940]   or the year in which they stop working.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.560]   And then we have the case in which either person has a government pension from work
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.660]   that wasn't covered by social security tax, so a job where they didn't have to pay FICA taxes,
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.880]   because then two additional sets of rules kick in, windfall elimination provision
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.420]   and government pension offset, and we're not going to dig into the details of those either.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.340]   But that can be a compelling point in either direction,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.480]   filing earlier or later for either person.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.440]   So it can push the math either way for either person.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.260]   So it's especially complicated, so in those cases it is helpful to use a calculator.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.580]   Again, open social security does account for that.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.440]   The other good calculators do to maximize my social security, social security solutions.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.700]   They both account for that, but it's important to use something
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.060]   that will actually do the math that's specific to your household.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:47.840]   Another possible exception is if both people are in very poor health, then it makes sense
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.620]   for the higher earner to take their filing date and move it somewhat earlier.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.040]   Or the opposite case, if both people are in really good health or you're just concerned
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.620]   about longevity, you can take the lower earner's filing date and push it later.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.480]   And then we have tax planning.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.360]   Tax planning is usually a point in favor of delaying, but it can go in either direction.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.280]   And so that brings us back to our three major factors.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.260]   We've spent a lot of time talking about actuarial math.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.320]   We're going to talk more briefly about longevity risk and tax planning.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.640]   So longevity risk, again, it's just the chance of outliving your money, right?
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.880]   The idea that the longer you live, the more likely you are to deplete your portfolio.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.980]   And it's usually a point in favor of waiting to file for your benefit, right?
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.140]   Because the longer you live, the more helpful it will be to have
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.280]   that larger social security benefit that's going to last a whole lifetime.
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.860]   However, something I see with a fair number of bugle head households, frankly,
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.000]   is that there's already no longevity risk, almost.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.020]   Because the amount that they want to spend per year relative to the level
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.660]   of assets they've already accumulated, they're just not going to spend
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.120]   down their portfolio during their lifetime.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.740]   It's just extremely likely that a good chunk of it is going to go to their heirs.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.020]   And so in those cases, longevity risk, it's just not a big factor in the decision.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.440]   It's not something we really need to think about.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.600]   And then we have tax planning, which usually is a point in favor of delaying.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.180]   And that's for two reasons.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:17.480]   Reason number one is that social security benefits are always at least partially tax-free.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.000]   At least 15% of your social security income is tax-free.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.620]   And if your income is below certain thresholds, more than 15% will be tax-free.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:33.440]   So, for example, if you spend down a traditional IRA in order
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.560]   to fund your living expenses while you wait to file for social security,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.380]   what you're doing is giving up future growth in that traditional IRA, right?
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.360]   So you're giving up income that would be fully taxable.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.280]   And you're getting more social security income that is at least partially tax-free.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.120]   And usually that's a good tradeoff.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.120]   And the other reason that tax planning points in favor of delaying in most cases is
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.360]   that it gives you more time to take advantage of Roth conversions.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.420]   And we'll talk about Roth conversions next.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:05.940]   But they're most often advantageous in the years after you have retired,
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.440]   but before social security has started.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.540]   So when you push that social security start date back further into the future,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.700]   that expands that window of time.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.680]   It gives you more years to do Roth conversions.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.920]   And the way I actually do this for clients when they come to me and ask this question is,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.420]   step number one, put it into the calculator.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.220]   It's, you know, easy.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.100]   It only takes a few minutes.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.800]   And it will tell you the actuarially best strategy.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.540]   But then we have to remember those other two factors.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.220]   We have to ask, okay, well, what about tax planning?
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.480]   What about longevity risk?
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.680]   And is there a compelling reason from either of those two points of view to do something different?
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.620]   And usually that something different would be for the lower earner to wait longer
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.460]   or if it's a single person to wait longer.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.080]   And so the next step is to go back to open social security
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.540]   and see what happens when we do that.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.340]   So what happens when we take the lower earner's filing date and push it somewhat later?
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.840]   Does the expected present value change?
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.460]   It will. But sometimes it goes down by a tiny amount, 1%, 2%.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.160]   And when that's what happens, what the calculator's telling you is basically
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.680]   from a life expectancy math point of view, this lower earner's filing date,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.660]   it's just not that important.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.560]   And so it frees you up to make the decision from a tax planning point of view
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.760]   or a longevity risk point of view.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.640]   It frees you up to go ahead and have that person wait.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.460]   But other times what you'll see is that when you take that lower earner's filing date
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.520]   and push it later, the expected present value just nosedives, right?
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.320]   It goes off a cliff.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.820]   And that's most often the case when there's a big age gap between the two people or if one
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.640]   of the two people is in particularly poor health.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:46.680]   And what it's telling you then in that case is, yes, it really does make sense
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.120]   to have this lower earner file earlier.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.840]   So that's it for social security.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.800]   Next up, we're going to talk about Roth conversions.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.420]   Just one second.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:02.600]   All right.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.620]   So should you be doing Roth conversions during retirement?
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.040]   Just to make sure that we're on the same page about terminology, you know,
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.120]   what's a Roth conversion, a Roth conversion is when you take money from a tax-deferred account
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.740]   and you move it over to a Roth account.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.660]   So for example, you're moving money from a traditional IRA over to a Roth IRA.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.080]   And when you do that, the money that you convert, the money that you move over,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.940]   it's generally taxable as income in the year that you do the conversion.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.180]   So why would you do that?
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.440]   When would you do that?
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.880]   The idea is basically whenever you have a temporarily low tax rate,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.980]   it makes sense to do a conversion.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.400]   Pay some tax now, right?
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.700]   Move some money from traditional to Roth now.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.380]   Pay tax at your temporarily low tax rate so that you won't have
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.200]   to pay tax later at a higher tax rate.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.780]   Because from now on, this money is going to be in Roth.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.960]   So whenever it comes out later, it's going to be tax-free.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.940]   So very succinctly, if your current marginal tax rate is less
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.940]   than the future marginal tax rate, well, hang on.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.560]   There we go.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.520]   Do a Roth conversion.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.700]   But there are a whole bunch of caveats, a lot of other things to consider in this analysis,
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.060]   things that make it more complicated than people often expect.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.540]   Sorry, I think we got a battery issue here.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.600]   Maybe I'll just stand here.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.860]   All right, the first thing is that this isn't a binary decision.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.720]   It's not a decision where we're choosing between convert none of the IRA
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.900]   or convert the whole IRA this year.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.660]   That's not what we're choosing between.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.680]   Most of the time, what it makes sense to do is convert a portion of the IRA this year
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.880]   and another portion next year and another portion next year.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.740]   And in many cases, we still don't convert the whole IRA.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.260]   You're only doing a chunk of it over several years.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.200]   So in theory, this is a dollar-by-dollar analysis that you're repeating every single year.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.120]   And often, the answer is that it makes sense to do conversions
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.420]   up to a particular income threshold each year.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.820]   So for example, right, because there's all these things in our tax code
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.520]   where as your income goes up, your tax rate goes up, too.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.180]   And so often, we pick a particular threshold and say, all right, up to this threshold,
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.180]   I would be paying these low tax rates on conversions.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.000]   And that seems like it's probably advantageous.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.340]   But above this income threshold, I would be paying a higher tax rate,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.880]   and that seems less advantageous.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.280]   So we're going to do conversions to bring my income up to this level.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.620]   Another important thing to keep in mind is
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:26.680]   that your marginal tax rate is not necessarily the same thing as your tax bracket.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.420]   A lot of people make this very understandable assumption.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.000]   You know, for example, if you're in the 22% bracket, people often think, well,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.460]   I must have a 22% marginal tax rate.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.220]   But that's not how it works because there's a whole ton of things in our tax code
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:47.740]   where as your income goes up, for example, if you are in that 22% bracket,
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.200]   as your income goes up, you've got your 22% tax increase from your tax bracket.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.760]   But then you've also got something else happening, right?
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.020]   Like you're becoming ineligible for a particular deduction or a particular credit
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.780]   because your income has crossed whatever threshold applies here.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.040]   And so when you account for this factor and this factor,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.480]   your total marginal tax rate is more than just that 22%.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.020]   Now, there's some things that can cause this to happen that are pretty common for retirees.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.740]   Number one is the premium tax credit.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.920]   That's anybody -- for anyone buying insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.440]   So it's especially relevant for anybody retiring before 65.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.940]   So before you get access to Medicare.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.880]   And the way that credit works is that as your income goes up, the credit goes down.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.400]   So if you're buying insurance on the exchange, and this applies to you,
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.240]   your marginal tax rate is more than your tax bracket because every additional chunk
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.700]   of income is causing that credit to shrink.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.660]   The way that Social Security benefits are taxed also causes this sort of effect.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.460]   Medicare IRMA, that's income-related monthly adjustment amount.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.580]   Those are just the rules for determining your Medicare premiums.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.340]   The way it works is when your income crosses certain thresholds,
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.240]   your Medicare premiums jump upwards.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   So at those particular thresholds, your marginal tax rate is way higher
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.920]   than just your tax bracket.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.960]   The 3.8% net investment income tax causes an effect like this.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.540]   And essentially anything in our tax code that phases in or phases out based on your income,
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.600]   it's going to cause an effect like this
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.260]   where your actual marginal tax rate is something different than just your tax bracket.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:19.520]   And the reason I am spending so much time on this, the reason I'm harping on it is that a lot
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.260]   of people -- what I see a whole lot is people taking a DIY approach to this analysis,
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.620]   which is cool because we're bogleheads, we're do-it-yourselfers.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.580]   But they also take a DIY approach to the actual tax calculations.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.260]   They try to do it in a spreadsheet, something like that.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.480]   And I'm a CPA, so I love spreadsheets.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   I mean, I use Excel every day, and that truly includes weekends.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.320]   But -- I'm not joking.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.140]   And it's just not the right tool for this job.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.780]   Because when people do the math in a spreadsheet, they almost always leave out one
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.000]   of those other factors or more than one of those other factors.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.460]   And so you see this situation where you've got a person who spent all
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:07.220]   of this time doing this analysis, and they expected to pay tax at this rate on the conversion,
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.400]   and they paid tax at this rate on the conversion.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.040]   And so they sunk all of this time and effort into it and did as much harm as it did good.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.280]   And that's just insane.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.400]   So don't take a DIY approach to the tax calculations, please.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.560]   But the good news is that there's tax software that does this.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.300]   It's good software out there.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.780]   Income strategy is one.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.320]   It's not free, but it's not super expensive either.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.660]   It's by two very well-respected experts in the field, or even, frankly,
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.360]   just TurboTax or something like that.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.940]   There's a good chance you're already paying for it, right?
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.300]   And even if you aren't, it's not very expensive.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.740]   And it has an extremely sophisticated tax calculation built into it.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.760]   That's largely what the software does.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.560]   And so you can basically just prepare a hypothetical return, right?
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.940]   Say we expect this much of this type of income and this much of this other type.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.960]   And then what if we did a $10,000 Roth conversion?
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.460]   And you see, this is how much my tax has changed.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.240]   So you can see what your actual marginal tax rate is for that amount of income.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.060]   And then you bump it from a $10,000 conversion to a $20,000 conversion
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.220]   and see what your tax rate would be on that next chunk of income.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.960]   And it'll actually do this math for you in a reliable and accurate way.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:21.120]   Another important thing to keep in mind is that for a married couple, the marginal tax rate
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.480]   for the household often goes up after either of the two people has died.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.280]   And the reason for this is that the standard deduction for one person, for a single filer,
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.760]   is half of what it is for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.100]   And the tax brackets have half as much space in them for a single filer
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.820]   as for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.660]   But when one person dies, the household's income falls by less than half
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.500]   because it's the smaller of the two Social Security benefits that goes away.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.480]   And the income from the portfolio really doesn't change.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.540]   You've still got the same interest and dividends and RMDs coming in.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.160]   So you've got a situation where you've got half the standard deduction and half the space
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.720]   in the tax brackets, but more than half as much income.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.760]   And so you often, not always, but often have a case
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.340]   where that surviving spouse now has a higher marginal tax rate.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.820]   And so the implication here is that it often makes sense for a married couple
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.020]   to prioritize doing Roth conversions while both people are still living.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:26.000]   And our last caveat here on the topic of Roth conversions is that the future tax rate
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.100]   that we're talking about might not be your future tax rate, right,
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.880]   because we're always asking what is the current marginal tax rate that you would pay
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.000]   on a conversion and how does that compare to the future tax rate, which is the tax rate
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.860]   that will be paid on these dollars later whenever they come out of the account later
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.800]   if you don't convert them right now.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.300]   And when you're doing that comparison, that future tax rate could be somebody else's.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.100]   It could be the tax rate that your heirs would pay on distributions
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.760]   from an inherited traditional IRA.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.060]   Because for a lot of people in this room, it's pretty likely that you aren't going
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:05.180]   to completely spend down your traditional IRA and 401(k)
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.940]   and other tax-deferred accounts during your lifetime.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.300]   And so the Roth conversion decisions that can make sense
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.580]   for one household might make no sense for another household just purely based
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.640]   on the difference in the beneficiaries of their accounts, right.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.580]   So if you imagine Household A and Household B who have identical finances,
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:28.080]   but Household A has one child and she is an anesthesiologist,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   very successful, really high income, she's probably going to pay a really high tax rate
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.140]   on distributions from that inherited traditional IRA.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.540]   And then if we imagine Household B over here and they've got four kids,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.920]   so the tax-deferred accounts are going to be split up among four people,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.840]   which means the distributions themselves will be smaller and therefore less likely
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.040]   to push the beneficiaries into higher tax brackets.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.320]   And if we imagine that the four kids are in careers with more modest levels of earnings,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.000]   they're probably going to pay a considerably lower tax rate on those distributions
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.760]   from the inherited traditional IRAs.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.900]   So even though the parent households have identical finances, you know,
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.400]   the Roth conversion decision that makes so much sense over here and is a clear
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.080]   and obvious win might make no sense at all for this household over here.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.840]   And to the extent that you're going to be leaving your tax-deferred dollars to charity,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.440]   the future tax rate is zero, right, because tax-exempt organizations are tax-exempt.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.740]   So if they inherit a tax-deferred account, they don't have to pay tax on it.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.400]   And so quick tangent, if you are considering leaving money to charity,
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.520]   these are the dollars to leave to charity because if you leave a traditional IRA
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.880]   to your kids or your grandkids, they only get to spend however much is left after taxes,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.620]   whereas if you leave it to a charity, they get to spend the whole amount.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.240]   So if you're doing that, then however much ends up going to that charity,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   that future tax rate is zero, which therefore means
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   that Roth conversions probably don't make very much sense, right, because the whole point
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.540]   of a Roth conversion is pay tax now so we can avoid the future tax rate.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.320]   But why would you pay any tax now to avoid a 0% future tax rate?
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.220]   It makes no sense at all.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.400]   So that brings us to key decision number three,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.920]   which is which accounts should I spend from every year?
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:27.880]   And in this discussion, we're going to be assuming that there's three accounts, really.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.240]   There's tax-deferred accounts or three types of accounts,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.060]   tax-deferred, Roth, and taxable accounts.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:38.560]   And I know we were talking about HSAs just in the last session, but at least for most people,
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.160]   the overwhelming majority of the assets are in these three accounts.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.880]   So we're just going to limit it to these.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.740]   And let's start with an example where you're trying to figure out which dollars to use
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.320]   for your next $1,000 of spending this year.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:58.500]   And let's imagine in this example that you have not yet used up the standard deduction this year.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.340]   So your income so far this year is less than the standard deduction amount,
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.220]   which means that if you took the money out of a traditional IRA, it would be tax-free.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.200]   And that sounds like a pretty good time to take the money out of your traditional IRA to spend it.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   So we're basically rigging the example, admittedly, to make tax-deferred spending look good.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.340]   So that is option A. Spend $1,000 from your tax-deferred account.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:28.040]   Option B is to spend $1,000 from a taxable account.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.720]   Just imagine it's coming out of your regular checking account.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.540]   And at the same time, do a $1,000 Roth conversion.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.980]   Now, there's a lot of things that are similar between option A and option B. Firstly,
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.760]   in both cases, you wanted to spend $1,000, and you did, so thumbs up.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.080]   They both win in that regard.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:54.060]   And in both cases, you created $1,000 of income that's going to show up on your tax return,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.940]   your Form 1040, but $0 of actual tax because that income just got offset by the standard deduction.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:05.860]   And in both cases, you've got $1,000 less in your tax-deferred account
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.380]   than you did a minute ago, right?
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.140]   Because with option A, we spent $1,000 for that account.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.840]   And with option B, we moved $1,000 from tax-deferred to Roth as the Roth conversion.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.380]   So that is the same between option A and option B. They have a lot in common.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.140]   So what's different?
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.760]   What's different is that with option A, you're left with $1,000 in your taxable account.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.560]   You didn't spend anything from your taxable account.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.600]   So you have $1,000 more in that checking account.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.560]   With option B, you have $1,000 more in your Roth account because you did spend that money
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   from checking, but you also moved $1,000 from tax-deferred to Roth.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.780]   And it turns out, that's the only difference between option A and option B.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.280]   In the one case, you have more money left in a checking account.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.220]   And in the other case, you've got more money left in a Roth IRA.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.580]   It's better to have more money in a Roth IRA.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.760]   That's just how this works.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.140]   Roth IRAs, if you invest that money, it's going to get to grow tax-free.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.640]   Whereas, if you took that money that's left in the checking account and invest it,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.960]   you're going to be paying tax on it.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   So option B strictly beats option A. And in this example, we're just talking about $1,000
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.640]   of spending, and we're talking about this very low 0% tax rate.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.600]   But the same exact thing applies when we increase the dollar amount,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.940]   so we increase the tax rates.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.100]   So for example, now we're talking about taking $100,000
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.180]   out of your tax-deferred account to spend.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:37.640]   And in this example, let's imagine that you have a 25% tax rate between federal
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.060]   and state across that $100,000 of income.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:46.940]   So that means you actually get to spend $75,000 because $25,000 went to taxes.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:53.960]   So that's option A. Option B, spend the same amount, but it just comes
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.840]   out of a regular checking account, taxable account, and do a $100,000 Roth conversion,
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   which again, because we're assuming this 25% tax rate, it's going to result in $25,000 of taxes,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.520]   and we're going to have that money come out of the checking account also.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:14.360]   So in both cases, you actually spent $75,000.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.960]   So they're the same in that regard.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.720]   And in both cases, you've created $100,000 of income that's going to show
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.320]   up on your tax return, and you paid $25,000 of taxes.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.440]   And in both cases, you now have $100,000 less than your tax-deferred account,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.460]   than you did beforehand, because with option A, you took that money out to spend it,
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.920]   and with option B, you did the Roth conversion.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.200]   So what's different?
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.600]   It's the same thing.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.280]   What's different is that with option A, you have a whole bunch of money left
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.780]   in your taxable account, the checking account, because you didn't spend it.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.300]   And with option B, you've got a bunch of money in a Roth IRA.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.840]   And again, option B wins in the exact same way and for the exact same reason.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:58.360]   And over a few years of spending, this makes a really big difference.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.820]   You can have a bunch of money in a regular checking account or a bunch of money
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.380]   in a Roth IRA, and the Roth IRA is better.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:13.440]   Now, I know a lot of people are probably thinking, okay, cool, but I don't keep like years worth
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.660]   of spending in a checking account, and that's normal.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.380]   But what we're talking about here is not only spending the money that's
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.460]   in your checking account right now, we're also talking about spending any money that's
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.920]   in a savings account, as well as anything that automatically shows up in your checking account.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:34.080]   So if you're still working or if your spouse is still working, presumably that money shows
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.580]   up in your checking account, and that's some of the most tax-efficient money
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.820]   to spend every month and every year.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.320]   Same thing with Social Security benefits.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.420]   It's getting paid into your checking account, and that's some of the best money
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.840]   to spend every month and every year.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.360]   If you have a pension or an annuity, it's showing up in your checking account,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.000]   and that's some of the first most tax-efficient money to spend.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.860]   Interest and dividends from holdings in a taxable brokerage account,
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:03.560]   it often makes sense during retirement to turn off automatic dividend reinvestment,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.940]   have that money sent to your checking account, because it's some of the best money
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.440]   to spend from a tax point of view.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.680]   RMDs, it's money coming out of tax deferred, shows up in a taxable account,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.460]   that's some of the best money to spend.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:21.820]   And in fact, it also makes sense to spend any assets in a taxable brokerage account
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.320]   where there's unrealized losses or only very modest unrealized gains.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.540]   So basically, anything where if you sold it, you wouldn't have to pay tax
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.680]   or you'd only have to pay a tiny amount of tax.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.520]   And so, just to reiterate, the whole idea here is that before spending anything at all
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.720]   from a retirement account, you want to spend any assets from taxable accounts
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.080]   where you wouldn't have to pay any additional tax to spend those dollars.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.960]   And then if you still have low tax rate space that isn't being used
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.520]   up because you aren't taking money out of a tax deferred account to spend it,
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.480]   fill up that low tax rate space by doing Roth conversions.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:06.060]   Now, of course, in a lot of years, you're going to spend all
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.500]   of those checking account dollars and still need to spend more.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.820]   So it will have to come out of a tax deferred account or a Roth IRA.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:20.000]   And so, in those years, the general analysis is to ask how does your current marginal tax rate,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.720]   so the tax rate you would pay taking the money out of a tax deferred account,
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.660]   how does that compare to the future marginal tax rate?
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.320]   If your current marginal tax rate is less, you take advantage of that low tax rate
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.480]   by spending from tax deferred.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.120]   And if your current marginal tax rate is higher, you spend from Roth,
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.600]   the idea being my tax rate right now is high, so I'm going to try
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.320]   to keep my income low by spending from Roth.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.860]   Now, what you might notice is that this math comparison we're doing,
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.380]   current marginal tax rate compared to future marginal tax rate,
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.120]   it's the exact same comparison we were doing for Roth conversions.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.520]   The math is exactly the same, and so all of the same caveats
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.480]   and extra considerations, they apply in just the same way.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.920]   Number one, it's not a binary decision.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.060]   You're not usually choosing spend only tax deferred this year or spend only Roth.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.420]   It often makes sense, spend from tax deferred up to a particular income limit
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.600]   and then spend from Roth, so in many years, that's what you're going to be doing.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.040]   And we have to remember that your marginal tax rate is something different
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.560]   than just your tax bracket in many cases.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.080]   So please, please, please don't DIY your way into the tax calculations, use tax software,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:34.500]   which is very affordable and available, and we have to remember that for a married couple,
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.120]   the marginal tax rate often goes up when either of the two people dies.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.320]   And so that can be a point in favor of spending
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.820]   from tax deferred while both people are still living.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.660]   Take advantage of the relatively lower tax rate at that time.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.780]   And finally, we need to remember that the future tax rate
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.600]   in this comparison could be somebody else's.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.660]   To the extent you're leaving these dollars to somebody else at your death,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   the future tax rate is not your own, but it's the tax rate that will be paid
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.160]   by whoever you're naming as the beneficiary of these accounts.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.140]   So just to reiterate the whole plan here,
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.700]   because I know it's not the most intuitive thing in the world.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.000]   Taxable assets are the first priority for spending every year.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.020]   And that includes anything in your checking account, everything that automatically gets paid
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.100]   into your checking account, anything in a savings account, and any taxable brokerage assets
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.380]   where you wouldn't have to pay very much tax to sell them to use them for spending.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.480]   So in other words, it's everything in that taxable category.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.300]   Other than holdings that are already highly appreciated.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.820]   So things that have already gone way up in value since you bought them.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.940]   Those ones you generally want to try to hold on to.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.860]   And ideally, never sell them at all, if that's plausible for your circumstances.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.100]   Because then if you leave them to your kids or grandkids or whoever it is,
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.700]   could be a charity, really anyone, they get a step up in cost basis and then all
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.580]   of that appreciation ultimately goes untaxed.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.500]   So step one, spend everything from taxable other than those things
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.980]   that are already highly appreciated.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.380]   And then if you still need to spend more than that in a given year,
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.440]   then when your current tax rate is high, spend from Roth.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.540]   And when your current tax rate is low, spend from tax deferred.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:22.400]   And then when you're following this strategy, if in any given year you have low tax rate space
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.620]   that you haven't yet used up, because you're not spending from tax deferred accounts,
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.060]   use up that low tax rate space with Roth conversions.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.880]   Because then you're going to be left with more money in Roth.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.980]   And that's really it.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.980]   Those are the three questions I wanted to talk about.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.460]   So we've still got some time for questions.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:42.620]   [ Applause ]
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.280]   >> Okay, I'm Lady Geek.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:52.980]   Okay. My, sorry, my perspective, when I talk, post things in a forum,
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.900]   I always take the perspective of a new ambassador.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:00.340]   One thing that's screaming to me is that we have a lot of people,
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.680]   new people here who probably do not understand what a Roth conversion is.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:10.960]   And what my big fear is that doing the wrong thing can be worse than doing nothing.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.500]   Don't mess with the IRS is a thing we always follow.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:22.220]   So if you don't understand what these two words together mean, first of all, okay,
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.720]   push the boatheads wiki, there's a Roth IRA conversion.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.280]   But if you don't do this correctly, we receive a lot of people posting in the forum,
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.240]   not a lot, but significant numbers saying, I messed up my Roth conversion.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.360]   So please be careful.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.000]   And this is not something, I would call this more like an advanced type of investment.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.740]   People just starting out, I think you can ignore Roth conversions.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.140]   Because if you don't understand them, maybe later you can understand them.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.360]   But be safe and stick with what you know first.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.720]   Under, never invest in anything you don't understand.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.620]   So I'm just putting a big caution flag here that this is something that, all right,
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.440]   do I have to understand Roth conversions?
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.460]   No. It might not save you that much anyway.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.180]   In theory, yes.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.320]   In practice, maybe not.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.760]   You don't know what you'll be paying in the future.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:14.120]   Okay, so that being said, also in the boatheads wiki is a tax estimation tools page for this.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.600]   You want to know, I personally use H&R Block.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.520]   I just throw everything in my tax software.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.860]   I can do spreadsheets, the retiree portfolio model to do Roth conversions.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.820]   No. Put it in your tax software and give it your best shot, run a few sneers.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.360]   It's just going to sense and just watch how much your refund or balance due changes.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.560]   That's all you need to know is what's your bottom line.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.320]   And the third thing is, which account to spend from is
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.100]   that you have to be careful on your own situation.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.100]   Say I post in a form for my mom for managing my mom's account in the personal investments.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.800]   I create an investment policy statement.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:54.100]   But in her situation, she has a very large medical expense,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.920]   qualified medical expense under memory care.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.580]   That is huge.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.800]   I am taking that as a tax strategy to put it as a medical deduction.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.420]   That will allow me to draw down from her traditional IRA with minimal tax impact.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.120]   And I want to draw it down for errors.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.520]   So be careful, use your tax planning software as your guide.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.220]   So I'm playing games because I'm modeling this in tax software.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:24.700]   So her number one priority for draw down is the traditional IRA, not the taxable account.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:29.280]   And I will be doing a Roth conversion so I can take it, you know, play games like that.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.020]   >> Yeah, just going to highlight, but that's the exact situation.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.620]   >> Yes, yeah.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.780]   And it's the exact.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.000]   >> Spend, use that deduction.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.520]   >> Yes.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.980]   >> To offset the Roth conversion income.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.420]   >> Yes.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.700]   >> Spend from that taxable account.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.200]   >> Yes, yes.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:41.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.040]   >> So I just say just, and Bogleheads Wiki is a great place.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.880]   Getting started.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.580]   >> Absolutely, yes.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.520]   Good shout out to the Bogleheads Wiki.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.240]   And it's a, sorry, yes, absolutely, worth applauding.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.700]   And Lady Geek is absolutely right that Roth conversions,
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.460]   make sure you understand the concept, you know, what this is, how to do it,
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.620]   what the implications are going to be.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.520]   Take your time with it.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.100]   Don't rush that decision, absolutely.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.700]   >> My question is also about Roth conversions.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:17.420]   I've been doing them, trying to fill up a low tax bracket, and we are in a situation
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.000]   where we won't necessarily have heirs, we don't have children.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.420]   So unless it goes to our lucky nieces and nephews, most of it,
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.620]   assuming we don't spend it all on travel, we'll probably go to charity.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:33.020]   But I have been doing the Roth conversions more with the,
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.480]   knowing that charity doesn't have to pay anything.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.620]   The only other reason I could find was that if we do the Roth conversions now,
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.760]   we would possibly lower our future RMDs.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.800]   Is that good, good thinking?
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.560]   >> Yes, it's absolutely true.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.960]   Roth IRAs don't have RMDs while you're still alive.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.980]   They have RMDs for beneficiaries of the account.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.380]   And so that is a point in favor of Roth conversions,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.880]   that you're reducing your tax deferred accounts.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:09.820]   However, an important thing to keep in mind here is that, depending on the household,
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:15.260]   the RMDs might not be a bad thing, because again, that's the, it's a several-way tie
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.680]   for the most tax-efficient money to spend every year.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:25.080]   So if your desired level of spending exceeds the amount that you're considering
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.040]   as RMDs, plus the other things in that category that we talked about,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.760]   then the RMDs aren't a bad thing at all.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.300]   There's absolutely no point in reducing them.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.580]   But if that's not the case, so your desired level of spending is here,
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.740]   and your RMDs plus Social Security is going to be here,
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.800]   then there is an advantage to reducing them.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:49.440]   However, I would say that it's worth modeling, well, two things here.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.960]   It's worth modeling how much is going to go to charity eventually, you know,
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.660]   upon your death or your spouse's death.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.760]   And of course, that's got a million unknown factors, right?
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.840]   We don't know how long we're going to live.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.780]   We don't know what investment returns we're going to get, but it's worth modeling that.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.420]   And then the second thing, though, is we haven't talked
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:11.920]   about qualified charitable distributions yet, but that is once you reach age 70-and-a-half,
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:19.820]   and it is age 70-and-a-half, rather than 72, you can have money sent from a traditional IRA,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.400]   another caveat here, specifically has to be a traditional IRA, it cannot be a 401(k),
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.900]   money sent directly from a traditional IRA to a qualified charity.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.660]   And that money comes out tax-free.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.880]   You don't have to pay tax on it.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.920]   The charity doesn't have to pay tax on it.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.040]   And once you're 72, it counts towards your RMDs.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:45.080]   So if you're in this situation where you're expecting, oh, my RMDs are so high,
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.600]   and I'm not going to need that money for spending, but you don't plan to leave the money
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.800]   to anyone other than charity anyway, it probably makes sense to just use that money
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   for QCDs, Qualified Charitable Distributions, and not worry about the fact that there's RMDs,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.480]   because you're planning to leave the money to charity at some point,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.920]   so you can just give it to them now, and I wouldn't really --
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:13.380]   it's hard to say without knowing all of the analysis, but it's pretty likely that if you're okay
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.980]   with doing Qualified Charitable Distributions, and you're leaving the money to charity upon your
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.060]   death, Roth conversions are likely not a great idea going forward.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:26.280]   >> Hi, Jason Lynch from Detroit.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.980]   Shout out to Detroit Chapter.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:33.720]   One comment is, buy your tax software around Black Friday,
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.460]   so you can do your hypothetical tax preparation before end of year, and then maybe make
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:45.880]   that additional Roth contribution a DAF -- or Roth conversion, DAF contribution.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.600]   I have a question, though, for Mike on Social Security.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.360]   It's hypothetical.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.720]   Imagine there are triplets.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.240]   Everything is identical.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.400]   Earnings, lifestyle, everything.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:07.280]   If one claims at 62, one about full retirement age, and one about age 70,
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:15.480]   if Washington changes the rules, do you think they'll generally be treated the same,
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.760]   or would maybe the early claimer get a benefit because they claimed early,
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.840]   or are they close enough that it probably -- any changes won't affect them differently?
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:32.280]   >> I would be very surprised if any changes are not based on birth year.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.720]   If they're based on, oh, you've already filed, so we're not going to change yours,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:41.120]   and you have filed -- or, I mean, you have not filed, so we are going to change yours.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.680]   But legislation is hard to predict.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.240]   I mean, when I talk to other tax professionals, all of us,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.040]   every person I've ever asked this question was shocked
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   by all the various changes included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.000]   I don't know anybody who had it on their list of things that they were expecting,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.200]   that the standard deduction was going to be doubled and exemptions would go away.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.640]   No one, no one I know was, like, including that in their,
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.320]   yeah, this will probably happen analysis.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.280]   Similar thing here.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.200]   It's really -- I can't -- I don't know what Congress is going to do.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.120]   My guess would be that it would be based on birth year.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.040]   If nothing else, that's pretty darn easy to implement.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.920]   It's pretty easy to explain.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.800]   So those are both points in favor of the legislation that way, but I don't know.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.080]   >> Hi, my name's Dave Hamilton.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.400]   I'm from Brookfield, Wisconsin.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.760]   You know, you touched on IRMA, and I thought I would elaborate on some things
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.440]   that I've learned, mainly the hard way.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.880]   And with IRMA, as you said, it's surcharges for your Medicare premiums.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.000]   And there are several tiers to that, four or five tiers.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.040]   And if you go over that income tier, you're going to be paying a premium.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.920]   And one of the key things to remember is if you go even $1 over,
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.760]   you're going to be paying the full premium for that bracket.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.280]   And so one of the things that I found important while I'm deferring pension and Social Security
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.680]   and all that stuff is to very carefully track my income,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.280]   and it has to be your modified adjusted gross income.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.640]   So your adjusted gross income plus municipal bond income, basically.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.600]   And then doing my Roth conversion up to that IRMA level.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.720]   And if I go -- if I'm forced to go over that IRMA bracket, I might as well go up to the top
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.600]   of that bracket and take advantage of it.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:34.480]   So these are -- and this IRMA modeling usually doesn't come out in things like TurboTax.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:34.840]   >> Right.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.920]   >> And so you have to model this by hand.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.600]   Keep very careful track of your income if you're going to do these Roth conversions and things
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.320]   to be able to take full advantage of it.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.640]   So I just wanted to comment on that.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.160]   >> Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.680]   Thank you.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.880]   TurboTax, when we're talking about what's my marginal tax rate on a conversion
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   or on distributions that I'm anticipating, it's only looking at taxes.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.200]   Medicare IRMA, I can consider it essentially just, you know,
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.000]   a piece of that marginal tax rate, but it isn't going to be modeled by TurboTax.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.920]   You're absolutely right.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.520]   So you'll have to include that on your own manually.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.360]   If you're using tax preparation software as opposed to retirement planning software.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:11.600]   >> Hello.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.080]   >> Could you repeat that?
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.440]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.000]   >> Okay.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.320]   >> Retirement portfolio model spreadsheet?
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.560]   >> Okay. Look it up.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.240]   Excellent.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.000]   >> Okay. Yes.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.720]   My name is Brian Polges from San Diego, California.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.800]   And I'm the one that prematurely asked the Social Security question yesterday of you.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.880]   But now it's not premature.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:04.120]   And you did -- and the part of your presentation I was interested in was
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:10.200]   where you were talking about if your partner or spouse is younger.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.320]   So mine is seven and a half years younger.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.840]   And also when there's a large income disparity,
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.160]   mine is the higher income by quite a bit.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.240]   And I was really interested in that four box thing that you put up.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.200]   Could you speak more about that please?
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.040]   >> Sure. For the higher earners filing decision,
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:38.560]   the life expectancy we're concerned with is the second to die joint life expectancy.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.920]   So how long will it be until both people have died?
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:50.840]   And so the younger that your spouse is relative to you, the longer that life expectancy.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.800]   And so that's a part of -- it makes it more advantageous for you to wait
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.400]   to file the younger your spouse is relative to you essentially.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.640]   Is that --
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.560]   >> Yeah. The part -- I understood that.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.840]   But for the younger spouse, could you speak to that?
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.480]   >> Okay. Great.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.160]   So for the younger spouse now we're concerned with the first to die joint life expectancy.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.200]   However, it's -- and by definition that is a shorter life expectancy
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   than the second to die joint life expectancy.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:22.200]   However, the -- that takeaway that the younger your spouse is relative to you,
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.440]   the more advantageous it is to delay, that's still true.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.000]   So you're both older and the higher earning spouse.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.840]   Okay. So for the younger earning spouse or for the lower earning spouse,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.440]   it's generally advantageous to file early.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:41.160]   The fact that you're older relative to her or him makes it even more advantageous
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.200]   for your spouse to file early.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.920]   >> Oh, to file early.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.360]   >> Correct.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.560]   >> Okay. Thank you.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.280]   >> Yep.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.880]   >> Thank you so much, Mike.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.600]   That was absolutely fabulous.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   [ Applause ]
