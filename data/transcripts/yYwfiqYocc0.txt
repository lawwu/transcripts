[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Alright, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast. And with me
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.160]   again, this week, the Sultan of science, the Prince of panic
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.920]   attacks, the Queen of Ken, why? David Friedberg, the dictator
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.640]   trim off poly hop at a wearing beautiful Mr. B sweater. And
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.960]   David sacks the rain man himself. Thanks for coming to my
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.000]   Laura Piana dinner on Tuesday, Jacob. That was wonderful.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   Thanks. At least one bestie showed up for you. Wonderful,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.600]   wonderful dinner. I sat as far away from the Laura Piana people
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.280]   as possible in the arranged seating. Thank you for that. I
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.760]   guess maybe you were like, I'm gonna contain the damage.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.880]   Bernard Arnault said, put put the all caps got the end and I
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.560]   said, Okay, yeah, he still heard me. I was like, what's the
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.280]   amuse bouge? Joe at dinner every time he said something he yelled
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.000]   like he was in
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.200]   I want another butterscotch pudding.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.560]   Butterscotch pudding is delightful.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.600]   Four feet away from me. Jake, how you take the cab slot. Sean
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.800]   was so embarrassed. Chef Sean crushed it. Chef Sean crushed it
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.760]   once again. Were you sounding alarms when the restaurant like
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.360]   almost ran out of something? Alert, alert, alert. Restaurant
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.520]   is running low on coffee. We're dangerous.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.480]   Rain Man David
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.800]   sack.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:37.880]   All right, everybody, welcome to the pod where we, you know, try
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.000]   to inform you we try to make some jokes here. I just want to
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.680]   make what is a little bit of an opening statement here. It's not
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640]   an apology. And it's not a victory lap in any way. But
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.840]   there's been a lot of attention, I think, on the last episode of
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.360]   the pod and perhaps some tweeting from two of the four
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.240]   besties this past weekend. I saw and I you know, I'll let you
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.600]   speak for yourself here, sax and we're going to get into the
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.040]   timeline of what's occurred. And then what are potential outcomes
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.000]   here and solutions to the banking issues that we've
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.640]   witnessed in what is a week since the bank run on Silicon
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.120]   Valley Bank and the shutdown on Friday. But what I saw and again,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.800]   speaking only for myself here was absolutely terrifying up
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.360]   close and personally, watching people pulling money out of
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.480]   banks and watching people have to set up loans to hit their
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.400]   payroll. And this was like one of those surreal moments in a
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.840]   movie where like a meteor is coming towards Earth and you see
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.280]   it in the telescope and nobody else sees it or only a small
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.200]   number of people in the observatory see it. And I think
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.360]   part of the reason people listen to this podcast is because we
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.280]   are insiders and speaking again, just for myself, I'm always
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.720]   trying to be exceptionally candid and transparent with the
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440]   audience. Additionally, I make jokes. So sometimes you might
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.280]   laugh during this podcast, or you might laugh when you're
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.600]   reading my tweets. And that's part of what I do. Now, I also
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.120]   realize that we have an audience now that is larger than I think
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.280]   any of us expected for this podcast, I certainly magnitude
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.680]   larger than I expected. And frankly, I didn't know if this
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.400]   podcast was going to make it past 50 or 100 episodes. And my
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.040]   Twitter following count doubled since we started this podcast.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.160]   And
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.640]   well, that's because you tried to ruin the pot.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.800]   I think it was because of the caps locks. But anyway, putting
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.840]   all that aside, what I would like to say as well is like, we
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.200]   are living in a situation that is unprecedented. I think the
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.640]   alarm bell I sounded, you know, was because I saw a fire. We'll
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.680]   get into the timeline here. But I sounded that alarm bell after
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.440]   Silicon Valley Bank was put into receivership. And when I saw
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.600]   additional bank runs occurring, I wouldn't change it. I think
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.760]   these were the right the right thing to do was to inform folks.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   Now, I did use all caps, perhaps a little too much. That was a
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.440]   little bit of a bit if people didn't understand that maybe I
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.800]   need to adjust my communication style now that this thing is so
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.840]   popular. But I stand by my mode of operating in the world, which
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.960]   is I always want to be candid with people. I always want to
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.520]   tell the truth. And yeah, sometimes I make jokes about
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.000]   life and, you know, dealing with these stressful situations.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.120]   That's it. It's not an apology. It's more of an explainer. And
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.960]   yeah, maybe I need to adjust the caps lock or how I deliver stuff.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.360]   But I stand by the message of what I said. And I think it's
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.560]   important for us to maybe look at the series of events and
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.800]   misinformation that has spread because there are people
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.360]   literally blaming venture capitalists for the bank run.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.800]   That is now systematic. And the balance sheets of multiple banks
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.120]   around the world. And I think that would be great for you to
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.920]   maybe just comment on the week that was and the timeline of
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.600]   events. Yeah.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.200]   So as usual, you're not apologizing?
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.520]   No, absolutely not apologizing. But we'll recognize that this
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.320]   platform is bigger. And that may be on the margins, I could
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.240]   adjust my communication strategy. But Chris, there's a
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.400]   lot of people who don't know that I make jokes. And maybe
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.720]   people don't understand what I'm joking and when I'm serious,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.400]   right. And so
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.520]   right, Jason, what would you change?
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.120]   Come on. I think I might not have used a Mad Max image and
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.600]   gifts about the end of the world. Because people are too
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.240]   stupid to understand that's a joke in a fictional movie.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   I see. So you find yelling effective? It depends.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.760]   Well, J Cal, I agree that I don't think you have anything to
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   apologize for in terms of the substance of what you're trying
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.880]   to get across. I personally could have done without the all
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.240]   caps. It was a bit. Yeah, what you're basically saying is
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   nobody should listen to you because you're not that
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.480]   important. And I wholeheartedly agree with that.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.320]   No, I'm saying understand, I might make a joke. Consider me
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   more in that category. Yeah,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.040]   all right, let's go back. Let's go back and look at the
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.320]   timeline. Because there are now serious accusations. And I
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.000]   would call it really scapegoating of and it wasn't
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.400]   just you, it was me and Bill Ackman. In fact, the Wall Street
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.320]   Journal editorial board, which I respect a lot, mischaracterize
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.000]   what me and Ackman were trying to do in terms of drawing
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.240]   attention to a regional banking crisis in progress or run on the
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.200]   banks. They called it spreading panic. I don't know how you
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.640]   tweet or publicly discuss a run on the bank that's currently
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.480]   happening needs to be addressed with an immediate federal
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.200]   intervention. I don't know how you can discuss it without then
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.720]   having someone else mischaracterize it as trying to
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   spread a panic. But Jake, how the Wall Street Journal
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.880]   editorial board didn't mention you. So you're off. They didn't
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.960]   know who you were. Thank you.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.600]   Thank you. But no, but seriously, so I went back and
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.240]   looked at the timeline of all of this. And so first of all, we
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   have to understand that this banking crisis now has swept in
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.520]   five banks, five bank failures. First, there was Silvergate, but
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.640]   everyone dismissed that because it was some weird crypto bank.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.720]   Then it was SVB. But everyone sort of dismissed it because
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.400]   they said it was based on panicky VCs rather than a
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.880]   systemic problem in the banking system. Then it was Signature
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.720]   Bank, which got seized on Sunday, which I think utterly
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.920]   refuted the idea that this was just a Silicon Valley problem.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.440]   Then you had the Fed step in and backstop First Republic, which
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.920]   would have been the next dominant fall if it wasn't
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   backstopped. And then five, you had Credit Suisse, basically,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.400]   again, avoid an outright failure because they got backstopped by
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.560]   the Swiss government. So we now have five banks in roughly a
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.680]   week. And these are not small banks or credit Suisse is a is a
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.720]   GSIB, a globally systemically important bank. And the other
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.080]   ones are top 20 top 30 type banks are talking about hundreds
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.560]   of billions of dollars in deposits. So clearly, there's a
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.120]   larger phenomenon going on here. And frankly, it's being caused
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   not by like anything VCs did, because VCs are just depositors
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   were just one class of depositors. And depositors are
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.320]   not to blame for what's going on here. What's going on is that
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.920]   these banks have huge unrealized losses on their balance sheet.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.280]   And the losses have come from the sun spike in interest rates.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.200]   That's what's going on. The sun spike in interest rates is
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.520]   because we've had the most rapid Fed tightening cycle in our
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.680]   lifetimes. In the last year, the Fed funds rates gone from
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.160]   roughly zero to almost 5%. That has broken a lot of things. And
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   the banks which have broken first are the ones that had
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.400]   pre existing problems. And they had horrible risk management.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.360]   But that's who gets broken first in a stress test, right is the
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.440]   most poorly run banks, the ones with pre existing issues. But
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.160]   just because they went first doesn't mean that others don't
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.320]   have similar kinds of issues. Now. I'm not saying this in any
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.200]   way to be panicking, where those banks will be fine. But there
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.440]   are larger issues in the banking system that are worth talking
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   about. And to the point about whether VCs could have spread
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.560]   this, Jake, how you're absolutely right about the
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.600]   timeline. I mean, I went back and checked. I personally never
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.720]   tweeted anything about SVB until Friday afternoon, when SVB was
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.400]   already in receivership, and the run on the bank had already
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.440]   started with signature and first Republic, and we could see it
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.080]   with our own eyes. And then this pod didn't drop the one where we
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.760]   talked about this problem didn't drop until Saturday morning when
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.200]   the banks were already closed. And by Sunday night, the Fed had
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.800]   acted and basically implemented our recommendations, which was
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.000]   to basically intervene. So I don't know how you can blame the
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.520]   search for scapegoats, I think is getting out of control. And
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.760]   it's just not factually accurate.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.600]   And you know that it's convenient to make tech, which
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.200]   is hated right now, Chamath and Friedberg, you know, the
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.840]   scapegoat venture capital is obviously the part of tech that
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.600]   people might hate the most or the easiest target. But let's
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.160]   talk about the Fed raised those rates because of inflation and
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.000]   inflation happened because of out of control spending due to
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.440]   COVID. And then the second administration, so you had a
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   Republican administration that spent a lot of money and then a
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.120]   Democratic administration, Chamath, that spent a lot of
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   money. So maybe we could even go backwards from Fed fund rate,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.880]   going, you know, what looks like parabolic when you look at the
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.520]   chart. Maybe you could speak to what got us to the Fed making
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.160]   those decisions, Chamath or Friedberg,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.840]   maybe I can just do a little cleanup on what SAC said. I
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.480]   think the issues that credit suisse are different than the
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.400]   issues at First Republic. And the issues that First Republic
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.800]   are different than those other three banks. The other three
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   banks, David, that you mentioned, signature, Silicon
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.640]   Valley Bank, and Silvergate, all had very traditional liquidity
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.080]   crises, right? We talked about this last week, which is
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.440]   duration mismatching, where you have depositors who want their
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.920]   money today, but you have assets that mature in 10 years. And as
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.880]   a result, you have huge unrealized losses if you all of
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   a sudden cash them out today versus waiting 10 years. I think
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.040]   what's happening at First Republic is really just about
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.280]   making sure that that loan book and the depositors can get
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.680]   parked into a combination set of banks that can take care of the
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.640]   balance sheet so that there are no more liquidity issues. At
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.600]   credit suisse, they have an enormous amount of liquidity.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.800]   What that was, was I think a lot of speculation around whether
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.120]   they would default on their bonds or whether they would
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.680]   theoretically need more liquidity. But the balance
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.880]   sheet itself was not only liquid, but also very solvent.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.640]   So I think that was just more of a haniky reaction to comments
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.320]   from a 9.9% shareholder who just said that they can't put in any
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.600]   more equity. But even then I went back, this is the chairman
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.760]   of the Saudi National Bank. He was asked on Bloomberg, would
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.600]   you give credit suisse more money? And he had a very
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.440]   reasonable answer. But it was snapshotted in a very awkward
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.040]   way. The first sentence was under no circumstances, would he
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.760]   do that? Okay. Now, if you stop there, you could be panicked.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.160]   But the rest of it made a lot of sense, which is he said, Look,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.000]   in Saudi Arabia, if we go above 10%, we have to go through
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.400]   regulatory approvals domestically, and there are
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.840]   regulatory approvals abroad. That's a big hill to climb. And
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.720]   all of a sudden, it no longer becomes a financial investment,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.640]   it becomes a somewhat political investment. And so we're very
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.120]   happy at 9.9%. That was the totality of the statement. But
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.840]   if you just cherry pick the first 45 seconds and ran with
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.400]   it, which people on the internet did, this is sort of what caused
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.200]   that second level wave panic at a GSIB. And then the Swiss
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.800]   National Bank stepped in. And I think that that panic has
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.600]   largely gone. Okay, so what is the real issue? The issue again,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.080]   is I think we have had a bit of supervisory failure here. Right?
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.640]   Because we all know this in any industry. If you let capitalism
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.360]   go totally unchecked, shareholders will demand
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.560]   immediate profits today. It happens in every industry,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.520]   except in ones where you can basically gamble on future
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.400]   profits. And that's what tech does. But every other
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.800]   shareholder in every other asset class demands money today. And
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.720]   that's the same for banks. The problem is the banks are a
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.360]   highly regulated business. They are supposed to be supervised by
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.880]   the regulators. And this is a very clear example where why is
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.520]   there not a real time spreadsheet? I mean, this is not
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.560]   complicated stuff, where assets and liabilities and duration
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.280]   mismatching can be known on a real time basis where the San
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.520]   Francisco Fed, Mary Daly should have a report that's escalated
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.040]   to her when SVB got over their ski tips, which they did in q4
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.360]   of 2022. So I think the real question that has to be
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.520]   examined is where were these folks for the last four months
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.600]   when they could have done something not just about this,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.840]   but rules in general for all banks that are not the GSIBs.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.120]   And I think that's a very important question that
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.880]   politicians need to get to the root of
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.160]   Friedberg, we discussed this article from seeking alpha,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.240]   which came out on let me get the exact date here, December 19.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.960]   Title of this seeking alpha story is SVB financial colon
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.800]   blow up risk. And the summary in three bullet points, says
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.880]   bullet point one potential losses in loan portfolios could
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.680]   severely impair book equity number two, unreal is unrealized
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.640]   losses in hold to maturity portfolio already equal to book
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.680]   equity. Number three funding environment for startups were
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.000]   pressure deposit base, adding even more pressure to the
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.320]   balance sheet. In other words, startups spending money to cover
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.680]   their burn rate, freeberg. And obviously, we had the Dodd Frank
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.600]   rules lessened or loosened under the previous
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.640]   administration. And that specifically was driven by
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.040]   Silicon Valley Bank that had a big part in that. So looking
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.760]   back on this, and people do want to place blame, let's talk about
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.920]   the effects that occurred, because this was hiding in plain
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.000]   sight. Literally in December in an article that looks like it
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.800]   was written by somebody who went into a time machine and said,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.360]   How do I warn people in December about this? Maybe you could talk
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.600]   about the feds interest rates, the spending and what led up to
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.080]   this look issue with the banks.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.760]   You guys remember when we started this podcast, three
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.240]   years ago, we were like, they're gonna shut down the economy.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.720]   There's gonna be crazy second and third order effects of doing
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.240]   that no one knows what they're gonna be. Here they are. And I
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.080]   think that's like the root of what is a rippling effect, you
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.720]   can't shut down the global economy, and stop trade and stop
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.520]   people and have the government step in to write a giant check
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.000]   and not expect that you're going to have to cash that check at
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.520]   some point. That's effectively what I think we've been kicking
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.040]   down the road here. The way we initially tried to resolve the
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.200]   problem was to drop rates to zero, and then spend our way,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.120]   you know, back to a growing supported economy, and then
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.560]   overshot ended up with, you know, too much stimulation, too
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.600]   much stimulus, to lower rates for too long, responded too
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.640]   quickly whiplash back. At the end of the day, there was a
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.360]   giant gaping hole blown into the global economy. When we shut
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.760]   down the world from COVID. There's no blame, just what
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.040]   happened. And when that happened, there was a massive
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.760]   cost that had to be born at some point. And it's going to get
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.720]   born at some point and the rippling in a pond, you don't
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.840]   know where the ripple is going to hit what part of the pond
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.600]   what leaves it's going to hit. That's what's going on still.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.000]   And it's such a dynamical system. It's so hard to say with
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.680]   linear certainty, this is what should be done and what could
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.280]   have been done and what they should have done at the time. No
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.360]   one had that predictive capacity back then. They did what they
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.280]   needed to do people thought that they should have dropped
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.480]   rates. They said we should have written all these big stimulus
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.360]   checks. Some people said you shouldn't some people said you
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.040]   did. Certainly. Some people are being proven right and some
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.840]   people are being proven wrong. But at the end of the day, the
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   economic loss that was realized at that period of time, we're
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.920]   still trying to get out of it and we're still recovering from
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.960]   and I think that's a big part of what's being eaten up right
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.600]   now. And you're going to see it in the wipe out of certain
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.760]   equity, you're going to see it in the wipe out of these banks
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.520]   of the assets that they hold and these portfolios and the effects
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.320]   of that are obviously you know, still being felt
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:04.520]   sacks. Do you agree that mistakes that this there isn't
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   somebody to blame because it is clear that the Fed said
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.920]   inflation is transitory that was wrong. And then they went faster
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.160]   than in history to raise the rates those seem like two
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.800]   glaring mistakes and then the Todd the Dodd Frank loosening
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.600]   under Trump and with Silicon Valley Bank pushing them that
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.120]   seemed like a really big mistake.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.200]   By the way, I wasn't saying the feds not to blame for not
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.880]   raising rates faster. That was because you guys remember I was
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.280]   the first person to talk about what Stan Druckenmiller had said
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.000]   that they're not raising rates fast enough that we've got
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.960]   massive inflation, we should have been raising rates. I was
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.000]   the first person on the show to be, you know, barking that. So
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.440]   don't don't forget, like I was there. Like pretty early, what I
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.720]   was pointing out was like we shut down the economy during
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.680]   COVID. The global economy. Yeah, I got you. So that is the main
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.440]   cause that is the cannonball that got blown through the ship.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.520]   Got it. And everything else is plumbing and patching and work
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.920]   to try and keep the ship afloat. And we're still dealing with
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.200]   that. And at the same time, as you guys know, we've been
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.280]   loading the ship up with debt, the global ship, the global
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.960]   economy with debt 360% global debt to global GDP ratio right
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.200]   now. And as that ship has gotten heavier and heavier to have a
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.080]   giant hole blown in the side while you're trying to do all
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.480]   this patchwork with all this debt weighing on it. It's a
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   critical challenge. And it's one that we're feeling acutely here.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.440]   They're feeling it in Europe now. And we're certainly going
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.040]   to see the global ramifications as we try and fix this economic
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.720]   catastrophe that was caused by COVID at the same time that
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.000]   we've been spending our way into a happier future that it turns
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.760]   out we have to pay the bills for at some point.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.520]   sacks your response.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.880]   The question of who you blame for this banking crisis has
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.640]   really become a political Rorschach test. And I've seen
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.120]   that there are six different parties that people want to
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.920]   blame in this situation. And there's some merit to all of
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.440]   them. But the degrees are very different. So number one,
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.120]   let's go through them. Okay, number one, the bank management
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.640]   of all these different banks, clearly, very poor risk
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.640]   management didn't do a good job. They are to blame. However, and
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.520]   Chamath is right about these banks, they differ in the
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.320]   details. But the point is that they're all operating under
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.840]   conditions of extreme stress. Where did that come from? Number
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.480]   two, the feds rapid rate tightening cycle, clearly, I
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.400]   think that the combination of poor risk management, with the
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.280]   spike in interest rates that basically has precipitated this
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.840]   larger problem. Number three, is I think the Biden
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.440]   administration spending, which in fairness, started with COVID
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.840]   before Biden, but Biden really intensified it. And then I
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.680]   think it really compound the problem in the summer of 2021.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.920]   By claiming that inflation was transitory when it wasn't, that
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.080]   allowed them to keep spending and keep printing money and kept
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.760]   QE going for another six months. That created the bubble of
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.120]   2021. Everything got super frothy. And then that made the
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.600]   rate cycle even more vicious, because you started six months
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.800]   later, they could have started six months earlier, and it
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.400]   could have been more gradual. And I think that really was a
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.600]   disaster for the economy. Okay, number four, the D reg in 2018.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.040]   I think Elizabeth Warren, and Ro Khanna have made what I would
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.880]   call a compelling case that the D reg in 2018 have contributed
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.680]   to this problem. I think, in hindsight, creating a two tier
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.400]   system of banks, where one tier are the systemically important
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.760]   banks who are completely guaranteed and backstopped by
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.400]   the federal government. And then a sort of lower tier, a second
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.600]   tier of regional banks was a poison chalice for the regional
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.440]   banking system. Because in the short term, it meant they were
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.480]   more lightly regulated, which may be appropriate for, you
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   know, smaller banks that aren't these mega banks. However, it
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.920]   has also now I think, created a situation where people are less
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.520]   confident about them. And so the money flows are going from the
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.280]   regional banks to the systemically important banks,
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.200]   the SIBs. So like I said, it might be a double edged sword.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.240]   And I think we're gonna have to look at those regulations and
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.320]   figure out what's the right regulatory regime to create
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.800]   confidence in the regional banking system. We want a
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.040]   thriving regional banking system. And so the question is,
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.280]   what's the right regulations that get us there? And then
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.040]   there's the final two that we can talk about later are I'm
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.520]   hearing wokeness getting blamed, which, listen, I think that
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.920]   wokeness was a distraction. There were a lot of crazy
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.960]   programs happening at these banks. But listen, if wokeness
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.640]   was the key factor, the whole fortune 500 would be out of
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.560]   business. Because, because they all do this stuff. They all do
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.760]   this stuff. So I think I think we're going back to the well a
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.000]   little too often on that critique. And I don't want to
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.320]   burn that critique out because I think that wokeness is bad, but
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.480]   it's not the key reason why this stuff happened. And then the
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.080]   last group that gets
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.960]   wokeness, we could also maybe frame it as ESG more broadly as
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.640]   the distraction because wokeness is charged ESG is real.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.880]   Yeah, what I would say for sure is that if these banks have
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.920]   spent as much time on risk management as they did on ESG
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.320]   or on woke, then this crisis wouldn't happen. So definitely
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.200]   a distraction, but not not the thing that like specifically
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.440]   caused it. And then just the final thing is VCs. And I just
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.840]   can't fathom at this point, given the multiple bank
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.240]   failures, given that we see the larger problem of unrealized
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.680]   losses on bank balance sheets, that somehow any class of
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.640]   depositors would be blamed for this. That just makes no sense
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:07.880]   to me.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.720]   Chamath I think the VC, the critique is specific to Silicon
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.360]   Valley Bank, because I think and this article was in the Wall
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.120]   Street Journal. But what it shows is a really complicated
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.480]   intertwined relationship between VCs and Silicon Valley Bank
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.880]   where, you know, VCs were given very cheap interest rate loans,
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.480]   they were given GP call lines of credit, they were given LP lines
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.680]   of credit. And then those same VCs would be directing their
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.840]   companies to put their deposits inside of SVB, who would then
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.640]   take those deposits and buy perhaps and buy risk. And while
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.800]   the reality is, all of this stuff will come to light,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.000]   because I think it will get exposed as we go through
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.720]   congressional hearings on all of this. But I think the I think
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.160]   pointing the finger at VCs in this specific case, is somewhat
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.840]   warranted, because there was a little bit of people working in
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.760]   lockstep together. And there was a lack of functional
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.800]   responsibility around how to be a true fiduciary. So if you come
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.120]   to a board, and your founder is 22 years old, and you give that
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.600]   person 15 or $20 million, I think it makes a fair amount of
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.880]   sense that you are supposed to be the more sophisticated
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.400]   financial person in that room. And if you have incentives that
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.440]   aren't properly disclosed to that CEO, and now a set of
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.160]   decisions are made, I think that that there should be some
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.600]   accountability for that, or at least some exploration of why
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.160]   that happened.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.040]   I just want to make sure the audience understands this
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.120]   because it is a bit in the weeds. And it's a bit inside
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.640]   baseball. What you're saying Chamath is, if I can summarize
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.520]   it, there are people who are the adults in the room, venture
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.840]   capitalists, they have deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, they
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.440]   also might have loans that are fantastic. With Silicon Valley
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.040]   Bank, I have a mortgage for this office from Silicon Valley
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.760]   Bank. And I talked about how on the last episode, how great it
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.600]   is, they come, they open wine with you, it's white glove
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.120]   service that you wouldn't get at another bank. And then they
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.560]   might have loans against what's called the GP carry or the GP
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.400]   share, or they might have mortgages. And so there's a
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.520]   conflict there. If you're a venture capitalist, and you're
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.880]   directing a 22 year old CEO to Silicon Valley Bank, maybe you're
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.920]   doing that is a conflict of interest. And in some cases,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.600]   Silicon Valley Bank is a limited partner in all of these funds.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.480]   My point is that all of these things, interest, okay, hold on,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.000]   we have to explain that. So imagine a situation, you go and
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.360]   start a fund, Silicon Valley Bank, and says, let me be a
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.280]   limited partner and invest with you. Let me give you some amount
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.200]   of money. I don't know where that money comes from, from
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.040]   Silicon Valley. Well, let's be realistic, more like 25 50
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   million 100 million. Okay, this is a lot of money. So a million
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.880]   kind of is whitewashing this problem. So you give them a
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.120]   reasonable amount of money. They're like, wow, I'm I have
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.320]   tremendous loyalty for you. Thank you. Well, do you need
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.480]   anything else? Do you need personal loans? Do you need
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.960]   lines of credit for your business? Sure, why not? I take
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.240]   those two. And invariably, on the back end, now your loyalty
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.640]   obviously builds up again, nothing, none of this is wrong.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.880]   But this is what's happening. And then you tell your companies
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.320]   to keep your deposits there, maybe the cash management
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.880]   program is not as strong as it would have been if you were more
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.720]   circumspect, and you didn't have those incentives to direct
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.360]   people to one institution only in any other part of the market.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.000]   So in the public markets, as an example, there is such a bar for
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.640]   disclosure, okay, and I cannot stress this to you enough
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.400]   related party transactions, all of this stuff, we have to tell
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.160]   everything not just for us. But even if our like sister or
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.960]   brother or mother may have a transaction with an entity that
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   we're doing a deal with. And it just isn't the case in private
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.760]   markets. And so it's not to say that anything untoward happened.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.480]   But when people point the finger at VCs, I think they are
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.360]   pointing to this whole set of issues and asking the question,
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.320]   shouldn't there have been more disclosure and transparency
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.840]   around it? And now that this has come to pass, shouldn't we
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.960]   explore it? And I think that's what the Wall Street Journal
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.440]   did, they started pulling on this sweater thread. And my
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.160]   guess is that you're going to find a whole ball of yarn at the
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.480]   end of it.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.760]   Saks, what do you think of this?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.800]   I think Shrath makes a fair point that if VCs have SVB as an
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.160]   investor, and then they're directing startups to use SVB,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.760]   that is a conflict that should be disclosed. By the way, we
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.000]   never did either one of those things. We never had SVB as a
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.760]   limited partner. And we also never direct our starts to bank
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.480]   at SVB. I don't know why we'd ever do that. Moreover, I always
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.120]   try to talk founders out of taking venture debt, whether
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.800]   from SVB or elsewhere. So
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.520]   listen, we'd be clear about that. And to be clear, I never
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   directed anybody to a specific bank. I know, like told people
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.160]   to get two or three banks and have redundancy. Totally. Yeah,
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.040]   totally. And look, founders have multiple VCs typically on their
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.920]   boards. So the idea that like anyone VC directs them, which
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.360]   bank to use, is this not, that's not realistically what happens
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.960]   at these startups. But look, I think Chamath is right that when
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.360]   there is a bank failure or any kind of failure this big, then
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.480]   all the practices are going to be under a microscope. And
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.520]   there's going to be some scrutiny of those. And maybe
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.120]   there should be. But my larger point is we're now operating in
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.040]   an environment in which clearly there's a larger set of stresses
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.920]   on the banking system. We've already had now five bank
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.800]   failures or near failures. Moreover, do any of us believe
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.560]   that this is over? Or do we believe there are more shoes to
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.880]   drop? If we believe that there are more shoes to drop, we may
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.080]   not know exactly what they are. But But I think all of us
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.080]   probably believe that we're not the end of this. But But just to
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.360]   finish the thought, if we believe there will be more shoes
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.400]   to drop, then clearly, the issues cannot just be limited to
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.880]   Silicon Valley, they have to be a larger set of issues.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.000]   There, I think that it's important to understand the
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.320]   facility that the Fed created. So what the Fed did this weekend
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.120]   is essentially create a buyer of last resort again. Now, how
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.160]   did they do this? So all of these banks basically have
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.440]   assets that they bought for $1 and are now worth 95 cents. And
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   that's what's creating this whole issue or 80 cents or 85
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.880]   cents, you pick the number, but they're not worth the dollar
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   that they bought. What the Fed basically said is, okay, give me
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.200]   that asset, give me that bond, I will value it at $1 and I will
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.720]   give you $1 as a loan. And you will pay me interest. And the
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.520]   interest rate I think is what's called OIS. And they added 10
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.920]   basis points on top. So I think it's about 4.9%. So what it
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.000]   allows all of these banks, and if you take all of the banks
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.320]   that are not the top four in America, so the top four are JP
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.120]   Morgan, B of A, Citi and Wells. So just ignore those for one
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   second, the other end banks, if you look at all of the assets
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.000]   that are underwater, because of all the rate hikes that sacks
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.960]   talked about, and you add up all those losses, that is about $2
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.760]   trillion. And the Fed didn't announce that there was a
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.040]   beginning and an end to this program, other than saying these
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.520]   would be one year loans. And so I think the exposure for the
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.920]   American banking system at a minimum is going to be this $2
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.600]   trillion. Because now the incentive if you're a banker
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.640]   right now running one of these banks that has not gone under is
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.040]   to immediately go to the Fed, put all of those assets to them,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.120]   get a loan, and now take that and buy different assets,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.920]   different bonds, different US treasuries that are yielding
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.400]   much more than what your old treasuries were yielding. And I
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.640]   think that's the arbitrage that we've unfortunately created. And
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.680]   the other question now, though, however, is, what does that mean
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.000]   for the top four banks? Right? Because if it's 2 trillion for
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.720]   everybody else, but the top four, what's the gap for the top
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.560]   four, that looks like it's somewhere between a trillion and
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.680]   2 trillion. So that's another amount of money we're going to
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.920]   have to cover the Fed will have to backstop. And then, as
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.000]   Friedberg said, these checks always come to what do we do in
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.640]   a year? Because in a year, the problem is, the only way to make
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.160]   the banks in a position to repay this much money in one year is
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.360]   to cut interest rates so massively, that these assets
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.920]   massively inflate. And now all of a sudden, you're in a
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.280]   position to cover this. So it's a very bad delta is because it's
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.040]   about they're down 15% 10% in book value, these longer term
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.240]   security. Again, it depends on what they bought. We don't
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.760]   really know enough detail. So I don't want to guess. But if you
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.720]   own these 10 year treasuries, you could be off 10 or 15%. If
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.480]   you own mortgage backed securities, it could be off a
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.760]   little bit more. If you own short term securities, they're
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.880]   off a little bit less. But these are with the government, you get
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.960]   a loan collateralized by these assets. So you still holding
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.600]   them, right? Yes. And they mature. So if the Fed takes an
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   emergency posture and says, Okay, guys, we want to avert a
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.640]   crisis in a year from now. And we're going to cut rates, these
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.160]   assets that these banks own will be worth more, which will allow
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.800]   them to repay the loan. As far as I can tell, all we've done is
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.400]   we've kicked the can down the road for a year. But I do think
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.960]   it's important for people to realize this doesn't solve the
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.840]   problem. It just means that mark your calendar for a year from
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.760]   now. We have a problem on March 15 2024. Because all those folks
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.200]   that took money, what do we do? Yeah, and so a year to work it
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   out, freeberg would seem like a good idea, because the Fed is
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.560]   fighting inflation, they seem to have gotten some portion of it
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.240]   under control. It's not out of control, right inflation. And
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.200]   maybe if they can slowly, you know, either start rate cuts or
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.600]   pause. So let's shift the discussion to Hey, what are the
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.200]   changes we need to make to the system? And how do we think this
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.800]   plays out over the next year? freeberg? Chamath had one
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.840]   suggestion, which was all of these banks should have a
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.240]   disclosure statement, mark to market every day, week, month,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.760]   quarter, whatever it is, just like circles, USDC, their stable
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.380]   coin has a page with their disclosures of all their
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.160]   holdings. So that seems to be a very productive one, we should
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.520]   have them mark to market the the Dodd Frank stuff. As Zack said,
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.160]   you know, Elizabeth Warren, probably correct, we need to
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.320]   reverse that. So those are two very tangible suggestions. What
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.480]   are your real time dashboard, we need to have a real time
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.600]   dashboard at every single Fed that allows them for every bank
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.960]   that they supervise to know in real time, they can ignore it.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.800]   I'm not sure that should be true. But they are their
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.440]   supervisors, they should see it, they should choose to ignore it.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.880]   But they should not not have it. freeberg. What are your
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.400]   suggestions going forward as to how we can learn from this
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.840]   situation? Forget about the cannonball, as you vividly
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.760]   expressed there, I think very well, great analogy. But just
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.680]   going forward, how do we keep the ship from taking on water if
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.880]   we do have a cannibal hit it again?
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.320]   Now we got a hard, that's a hard equation to solve. We got a lot
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.200]   of time asking you, that's why a lot of demands for money.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.240]   You guys see, I think there's a lot of things that are seem
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.960]   unrelated that are all pretty related right now. There's a
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.920]   massive protest underway by labor in France. There's a
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.760]   massive protest underway in the Netherlands. There's strikes on
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.240]   the underground in London, when we talk about global debt, and
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.040]   US debt, we often I don't think account for all the debt, which
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.880]   also includes promissory obligations made to a workforce
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.320]   global workforce that's been working for decades, individuals
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.360]   that have spent their whole lives committed to some company
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.040]   or to some government working with the expectation that
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   they're going to retire and have some benefits paid to them. And
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.760]   there's this massive underfunding of those benefits
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.280]   and those pools of capital, we very quickly talk about unfunded
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.400]   pension liabilities. But when you actually kind of account for
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.240]   the number of people and the amount of capital that those
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.960]   people are expecting that the workforce, the global workforce
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.920]   is expecting to be paid to them in retirement, both public and
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.760]   private, it's a massive amount of money that's not funded today.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.160]   And you start to see the cracks in the system, when that
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.960]   population says, my pension payments are not keeping up with
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.920]   interest with inflation, or when there's a threat that pension
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.560]   payments or retirement benefits are going to kick in at a later
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.600]   age, or you're not going to get them fast enough, you're not
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.040]   going to get as many as you thought you were going to get.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.280]   We have that problem in the United States in the form of
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.520]   Social Security and these underfunded pension liabilities.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.160]   That is the critical macro tension in this equation that I
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.280]   think drives the real problem that's going to come to a head
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.920]   at some point, we blew a hole in the in the in the boat. But
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.080]   we're also forgetting that there's like a massive amount of
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.640]   amount of weight that's going to drop on the boat. And I think
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.600]   that it's a really hard equation to solve, we can talk about
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.760]   keeping bank solvent and all this sort of stuff. At the end
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.880]   of the day, the central bank, it appears in the United States,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.720]   and probably globally, it's going to be one big bank, right,
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   they're basically going to take on the whole balance sheet
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.080]   themselves. And, and at the same time, you've got a lot of folks
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.320]   saying, I want to get paid more. I have obligations due to me.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.920]   And guess what, you know, Jason, your important statement
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.160]   is historically about the importance of democracies.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.560]   Ultimately, you know, the members of that democracy are
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.840]   going to say, this, this is a benefit that the majority are
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.240]   owed. And that's going to pull things out. I think the only
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.280]   stopgap, I'll just say one thing, the only stopgap in the
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.080]   next decade, is going to be significantly higher tax rates
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.360]   in the United States. I don't see how you're going to fulfill
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.400]   the tension gap that's underway right now, with respect to where
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.000]   productivity is going and where capital markets are going, and
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.360]   where the demands are on the system from people requiring
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.320]   additional capital to come out to them without taxing assets
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.040]   away from the asset holders. So this would be corporations and
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.960]   high net worth people. And I think that's why you see this
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.120]   Biden proposal. We may not like it. But at the end of the day,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.480]   it's going to be the only way to create a stopgap that's that's
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.720]   that's going to avoid massive inflation in the near term.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.520]   Reducing
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.200]   proposal, hold on, hold on one second.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.720]   Let me just say the only other way the only other I'll just say
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.600]   one more thing, Jay, got me. The only other way, besides, you
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.400]   know, a massive long term tax regime to fill the hole would be
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.120]   some extraordinary productivity gain. And this is where we can
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.760]   all have a hope and a dream and an investment and effort around
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.040]   technology, AI automation, people think that their energy
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.200]   job energy, but if you can get energy down below three cents a
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.680]   kilowatt hour, and you can scale its production by tenfold, if
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.040]   you can automate a lot of labor, if you can get AI to do a lot of
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.520]   stuff that we do today, productivity will go through the
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.920]   roof, the economy will grow fast enough to get out of the debt
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.720]   bubble and meet all of these liability obligations. So there
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.400]   are three ways. Yeah. So I think I think to me, to me, that's the
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.160]   long term, the medium term is going to be this tax stopgap is
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.840]   very high tax stopgap. And then the short term is going to be
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.160]   all the shenanigans that we're talking about.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.400]   Okay, I'll go to you in a second sack. So just to recap, there is
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.440]   actually a third way to there are three ways productivity as
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.360]   you very astutely point out, and we just highlighted some of the
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.840]   ways productivity could help whether it's energy, AI, etc.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.640]   The second is, of course, increasing taxation on the
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.320]   people who are at the top of the pile would be the likely
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.000]   solution. The third is also austerity, cutting spending in
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.280]   some way. But let me also propose one thing here, as we
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.760]   look forward to what do people want out of a bank? And how
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.880]   should startups or just individuals deal with bank runs
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.320]   and their trust in banks to Chamath's point? I was thinking
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   about this over the weekend. And in this discussion that we would
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.280]   have based on a lot of things you said, sacks, which was
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.800]   people just deposited their money, and they don't have the
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.920]   ability to assess if a bank is solvent, because the FDIC can't
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.840]   do it. And it's their full time job. It's their mandate to make
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.240]   sure these banks are solvent. So how is a consumer going to be
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.400]   able to do that? Or even a startup founder, or even a
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.720]   sophisticated investor, like Ackman, or any of us, if we're
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.400]   in fact, sophisticated. So let me pause for a second here and
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.640]   posit something. We don't want a bank, we want a bank vault.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.880]   Consumers do not want their deposits to be used for
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.200]   shenanigans. Just like many people would rather pay for a
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   social network than have their privacy data sold. So I think we
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.400]   should bifurcate banks into bank vaults, and banks, banks can do
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.440]   what they want with your deposits, you get free checking.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.560]   But what I want in a bank, what I want my startups to use what I
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.960]   want my venture firm to use is I want to pay the bank for
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.600]   services, whether it's 10 basis points, 25 basis points $500 a
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.600]   month, I would rather see my startups pay $1,000 a month in
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.840]   banking fees $2,000 a month on banking fees for $2 million,
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.400]   whatever it is, and pay for each check pay for wires pay for
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.120]   white glove service, whatever they choose, but not allow the
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.280]   banks to take that money and loan it out or do things with
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.240]   it. I just want to vault. And I think a vault service is what
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.080]   the majority of consumers want. And given what we're seeing with
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.200]   two insane bank run bailouts in our lifetimes as adults, for
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.120]   those of us who are in Gen X 2008. And now, we would rather
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.960]   pay for services. And I leave it to you, Saks, is this a
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.880]   potential solution? Because I don't hear anybody saying, give
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.720]   me a bank vault. And why does that service not exist in the
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.120]   world?
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.600]   Yeah, look, what people really want are they want a service
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.440]   provider who gives them the ability to make payments, which
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.200]   if you're a small business is payroll and payables, things
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.760]   like that. They want a money market fund to basically earn
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.160]   interest. And, and they want all that to be safe. I mean, it's,
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.360]   it's very simple. The idea that when you go open a checking
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.120]   account at a bank, that you are making an unsecured loan to that
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.280]   bank, that is not something that any consumer small business
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.480]   understands. That whole model, I think is completely obsolete
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.560]   and outdated. And what I heard so many people say, and I think
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.760]   this is not sincere, I think it's just because they hate
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.240]   tech, is that depositors should take it on the chin. Because
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.520]   somehow they made a stupid decision when they opened a
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.480]   checking account. It's like, are you kidding me? Listen, what do
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.240]   you want the process to be? You want consumers and small
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.680]   businesses when they open a bank account to have to review the
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.960]   financial statements of that bank, try to figure out all
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.600]   their disclosures, where their assets are, whether they have
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   toxic assets on the books. And if they don't do a good enough
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.000]   job doing that, if they're not smart enough to do that, then
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.560]   you want them to be disciplined. This is the word that I kept
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.040]   heard being used as we need to discipline depositors. The
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.880]   depositors are not in a position to evaluate the balance sheet of
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.400]   these banks. That's what the feds are supposed to do. That's
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.640]   what the regulators are supposed to do. That's what Moody's is
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.160]   supposed to do. And you're telling me that a bank that had
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.920]   an A rating from Moody's the week before and had an FDIC seal
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.280]   of approval, that somehow they got it wrong, and the feds got
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.360]   it wrong. But the
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.080]   in related news was to get it right. I mean, come on, that's
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.600]   ridiculous. In related news, Chamath, I would like an airbag
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.720]   in my cars to protect my family. But I don't want to evaluate the
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.080]   airbag technology and unpack it and make sure that it's got the
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.280]   right, right.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.600]   Yeah, let me finish the point. It's about consumer protection
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.520]   here. And I don't care who the depositor is, if the banking
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.640]   system is going down, because the feds haven't done their job.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.360]   I mean, pal, two days before the bank failures was testifying
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.600]   that he didn't see stress in the banking system. So either he was
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.400]   lying or asleep at the wheel,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.160]   asleep at the wheel, like
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.080]   and like I said, the feds had given the seal of approval to
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.760]   SVB and all these other banks, they had all passed the
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.760]   regulatory exams. And so to now put it on the depositor, when
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.960]   the fed screws up, and the regulators screw up, and
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.360]   Washington screws up by printing all this money and creating this
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.800]   inflation that we've had, again, out of all the six parties that
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.840]   you could blame, I just think it's the least culpable
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.080]   Chamath should there be a service that provides no
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.920]   interest, but is just a custodian of money that is
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.960]   absolutely protected? Where is the bank vault product in the
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.400]   world? Does it exist? Because I can't seem to find it. Some
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.360]   people seem to say I think Freeberg you alluded to this
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.960]   maybe in the group chat, that if you have a brokerage account,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.760]   that's kind of similar to what I'm saying, but it doesn't have
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.000]   it. I don't want any interest. I don't need any interest for
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.680]   putting this money in the bank for a startup. They're not in
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.080]   the business of making one to 5% and optimizing for that I have
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.520]   founders who are now sending me five page memos.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.480]   If they can't if we think if Yeah, if the bank can't use your
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.920]   money, they're going to charge you. So remember,
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   I want to be charged. That's the service.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.680]   I know. But I think this is an important point. A bank is a
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.240]   service provider. They spend a lot of money building
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.760]   technology, having people that work there providing service and
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   infrastructure. So for the services that they're offering,
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.200]   if you're not going to let them use your money to make
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.640]   investments with your money, and they can participate on that
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.360]   game, they have to charge you, they charge you. And I think
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   that's really what that
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.080]   but free work free work, not a service provider under the
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.400]   current laws, you understand how it works now is that what we're
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.400]   being told is that when you went to the bank thinking you were
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.400]   just getting a service provider, and frankly, largely a commodity
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.440]   service provider, you're getting a manager. Yes. And you're being
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.720]   told that you actually made a risky investment decision. Think
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.600]   about that. When you open a checking account, you are just
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.760]   trying to, you know, again, use a vendor, you are actually
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.480]   making a risky investment decision. That's what they're
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.680]   trying to say. And you deserve to lose your money. If you
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.000]   chose poorly, even though nobody else could figure it out. None
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   of the experts can figure it out.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.480]   You should talk about the the challenges of your system to
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.400]   someone who lives in Argentina. It's far worse in other parts of
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.440]   the world. And we've come a long way in the last 100 years, we
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.680]   talked about 500 or 600 bank failures on average per year in
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.400]   the 1920s. So I'm not saying that, hey, that's not the case.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.760]   But there's always been to some degree risk when people are
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.160]   giving their capital over to someone else. And we've
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.080]   certainly made huge strides in progress. But I think Jake out
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.000]   to your point, you know, there is a point of privilege. Now
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.240]   that people are saying I want to have a position where I know
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.440]   that my money is not going to get used, not going to get
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.200]   moved, going to be completely safe.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.520]   In a democracy for that. What's the price free birth? What would
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.240]   you pay for that? Because right now we're basically giving every
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.120]   crypto entrepreneur at zealot, you know, basically the high
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.720]   ground because they could make this product, I would pay 10
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.000]   basis points, literally $10,000 a year per million. Is that
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.440]   right? Yeah.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.080]   Remember when you thought Jeff Bezos was going to be president?
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.000]   I still think it's a distinct possibility. Anyway, what would
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.040]   you pay for this product? Just come off or like Bloomberg or
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:49.680]   Bezos?
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.320]   I don't want to speculate on new products. It's kind of a dumb
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.080]   tangent. I think the thing that you're bringing up though is
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.280]   dumb tangent. Okay.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:03.920]   Why doesn't a product like this exist? And I think that it was
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   very well explained. It's that every for profit business is in
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.080]   the business of making money. And there are physical costs
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.040]   that you have to bear. In the case of a bank, there is
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.640]   physical infrastructure, literally bricks and mortar that
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.360]   go into making the branches, there are lots of people, there
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.720]   is lots of software, there's lots of complex back office and
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.200]   middle office things that banks have to do in order to accept
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:31.360]   money that has a cost. So I don't see how it will be very
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:36.280]   easy for somebody to create a bank that just stores your money
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.560]   for you, without you being charged quite a lot of money.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.600]   Unfortunately, I think that there has to be a different way
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.360]   to solve this problem. And I think that what we did after the
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.000]   great financial crisis was the regulators wrote down all kinds
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.120]   of new rules. But the crazy thing in 2008, where those rules
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.080]   were written on paper, and now we're in 2023. And these rules
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.880]   can be written in software. And so I think what it requires is
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.160]   some amount of tactical real time intelligence that
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.800]   regulators need to have over those that they regulate. And I
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.160]   don't know why we're so afraid of demanding that the next time
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.440]   some of these complicated real time laws are written in law
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.320]   that they also need to get written in code. And I think
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.520]   that that's a practical solution. It should be the case
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:35.520]   that every bank that's supervised by the Fed has a
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.400]   dashboard that has all of the key levers that allows what you
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.640]   said Jason to happen, which is a real time mark to market. Should
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   those or should those be discovered? Or should they not
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.160]   be disclosed to shareholders? That's a different discussion.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.200]   But the regulator should have 100% transparency into how these
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.680]   organizations run because as SAC said, they are an enormously
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.240]   critical institution that at best case after this fiasco,
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.480]   what we've realized is very poorly misunderstood by
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.960]   consumers. And that at the worst case is being mismarketed to us.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.280]   Yeah, and I think that shouldn't be allowed.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   We're also missing the other side of the balance sheet. We
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.640]   haven't talked about it at all. But banks play a really critical
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.440]   and important role as lenders. banks act as the channel for
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.040]   lending capital to small businesses for lending capital
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.560]   to individuals to buy homes. It's the primary place where
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.080]   capital is provided to help fuel economic growth and prosperity,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.640]   particularly in the United States where we have such a
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.600]   liquid fluid and available mortgage market to support home
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   buying in America. And the absence of, you know, Jason,
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.640]   what you're talking about, having the ability to use
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.600]   deposits to make loans, and have what banks have fundamentally
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.200]   been in this country for over 100 years, which is taking
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.400]   short term deposits to make long term loans, and making sure that
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.720]   there's some degree of balance and availability of liquidity
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.400]   to support transactions. And ultimately, mortgage securities
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.600]   came out of the need to generate more liquidity by banks to
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.960]   support depositors. And obviously, there was all these
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.840]   inflationary things that happened in that market and
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.640]   bubbles that happened. But it's an important role that banks
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.560]   play. And the lending aspect of banks, if it gets stifled too
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.720]   much, because we swing too far the other way, it can actually
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.400]   have a really adverse effect on economic growth and prosperity,
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.320]   and the ability for people to to afford homes in this country.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.640]   So that's the other side of the coin and where things can go
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:24.880]   bad.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.560]   So this is where I find like the the current banking model to be
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.240]   sort of like weird and maybe obsolete and definitely not what
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.600]   consumers expect. So for example, if you go to a bank,
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.520]   and you put your money in a deposit account, and then they
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:41.640]   loan it out to make mortgages, do you realize that you're an
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.760]   investor in those mortgages as the as the depositor? I don't
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.480]   think you do.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.080]   I mean, what they what they do is they take those mortgages
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.480]   sacks, they package them up, they sell them, and they get an
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.200]   origination fee and they get the money back. Not always.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.320]   But not always. But maybe they should be maybe they should have
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.120]   to be a Wells Fargo do not exactly. So be a Wells Fargo,
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.320]   for example, they do a lot of that. But if you look at First
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.560]   Republic, they have a $90 billion loan portfolio on their
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.920]   balance sheet that they've not packaged up and sold. So the
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.560]   packaging and selling of mortgages generated the liquidity
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.960]   that the banks needed. But there's a cost to that. So a lot
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.560]   of banks will try and balance out their loan portfolio where
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.920]   they'll package some of it up and sell it. But when they do
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.720]   that, they take a loss, they pay a fee.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.960]   Maybe they should be required to do that. Because that might be
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.200]   because, because I mean, look, to the point about mark to
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.520]   market assets, it's very hard to mark an asset to market unless
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.240]   it's liquid and publicly traded.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.800]   Let me give you an economic point. I think that there's
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.560]   about $7 trillion in deposits in banks. So if what you guys are
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.560]   saying happened, you're basically sucking $7 trillion
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.400]   out of the system that's being used to fuel purchasing in the
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.920]   form of loans. And you're taking that set or call it a 10%
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.560]   discount to that. So about call it $6 trillion. And you're
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.680]   saying, we got to go find a market for $6 trillion of loans.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.720]   And then we're going to have $6 trillion of cash sitting in a
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.480]   bank account doing nothing. And that that challenges
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.200]   that cash, we're going to money market funds. So in other words,
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.160]   like you'd package up all those mortgage bonds, you create a
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.280]   mortgage bond security. And then if consumers if depositors want
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.520]   that product, they'll just buy it.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   Yeah, but what is a money market? It's it ends up being
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.840]   the same thing where money is you you earn interest on cash
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.960]   that's being used to make investments elsewhere. So
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.880]   right. You want to earn interest on your cash, it has to be
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.080]   loaned out somewhere to someone.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.920]   I understand. But what I'm saying is, look, I'm just
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.600]   brainstorming here. I don't you know, I don't have the spit
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.800]   balling. Yes, exactly. I'm not saying this is what should be
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.840]   done. I'm just kind of asking whether it might make more
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.520]   sense. What if on the depositor side, all of the things you put
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.040]   your money in our money market funds, and then when the bank
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.880]   goes out and does his lending business, it does ultimately at
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.680]   some point have to package those up, and they get turned into
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.280]   securities, you know,
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.880]   sexy, but money market funds. You know where that cash goes.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.720]   So when you when you invest in a money market fund, you're
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.000]   you're giving money to someone who's using it to make a loan.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.960]   Like it is also
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.600]   I understand. But then the deposit would never be marked to
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.920]   market is sexist point.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.880]   deposit would never be a risk. We never be a risk of bank
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.280]   failure. I just want to give
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.520]   you're shifting the risk equation to the fund manager,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.000]   the money market instead of the manager of the bank. And at the
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.720]   end of the day, that money is just the owner of that security,
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.760]   that money market fund, that would take the hit.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.240]   Okay, just as we wrap here, because I'm going to talk on
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.600]   some other issues as well. There's two things that are
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.960]   super tangible that founders can do right now are people who want
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.320]   to mitigate against these kind of issues. The there's something
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.120]   called ICS insured cash sweeps. These are accounts that
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.760]   automatically, you know, will put your money into multiple
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.120]   FDI insured institutions, 250 k at a time, we talked about this
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.160]   previously. There's a bunch of folks doing that in fintech. I
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.800]   won't give any of them free plugs here. But you can just go
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:52.240]   look in search for ICS. There is also maybe some thought here
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.080]   that the FDIC 250 k limit, maybe that's outdated, certainly for
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.960]   businesses, it is. So maybe that should double or triple. And
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.840]   obviously, that cost would be spread out. And then finally,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.040]   you can go to treasury direct.gov right now and buy
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.640]   short term government debt. And I literally have startups doing
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.360]   this who have major treasuries. They're going there and buying
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.080]   short duration stuff themselves, holding it themselves. So they
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.320]   don't have to worry. This is part of this provided by the
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.680]   government is my understanding and people are buying direct
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.000]   from the government.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.600]   I personally am not a fan of startups buying T bills because
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.440]   of the duration mismatch problem. They always
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.080]   underestimate when they're going to need their cash. And so I
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.360]   don't like tying up cash as if you had a giant treasury. Yeah,
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.560]   but this is always wrong. I see this all the time, whenever they
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.960]   try to say when start trying to create laddered bond portfolios,
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.440]   they end up needing the money sooner than they thought what I
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.560]   had much rather see startup do is buy 100% US T bill backed
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.120]   money market fund run by the absolute biggest of the big
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.040]   financial institutions, because you can get in and out of it at
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.400]   any time you want and without paying a fee. And that's so
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.440]   much better than trying to manage your own bond portfolio.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.600]   Let a professional fund manager do it.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.440]   Well, there are people who do provide these kind of bond
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.120]   ladders. I'm just telling you what the best practice advice
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   going around your symbol through like, a brokerage account, sure.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:20.040]   Or multiple ones, right. And but now this is I think speaks to
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.520]   Chamath. The fact that we have startup founders and people
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.720]   having to measure manage a treasury. This granularly, is
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.280]   this a failure? Or is this what should be happening? Should we
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.360]   have to have treasuries in the 10 million or $20 million range?
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:43.720]   Be this granularly managed? Or should this just be FDIC rates,
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.440]   you know, should be just 10x?
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.360]   Well, in the absence of regular regulatory changes that protect
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:53.520]   this money, you need to have a financially sophisticated actor
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.800]   on the board. And again, I go back to that should be your
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.720]   venture capitalist. And that person should not have conflicts
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.040]   of interest with the banks that they direct you to. I mean, I
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.240]   don't think that that's a very controversial statement.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.680]   I Yeah, it's just not happening. And I am just flabbergasted that
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.800]   people are not even doing the basic blocking and tackling here
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.160]   of having three or four accounts. I've always had three
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.920]   or four banking relationships always had it split up. Should
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.880]   we move on to some of the other pressing issues there?
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.680]   Was a really interesting founders fund story about them
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.000]   breaking their latest funded half, and then there is stripe
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.240]   closing their funding, which one would you gentlemen like to go
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.720]   to or a different story on the docket?
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.600]   I think there are, there are four things that are very
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:42.000]   interrelated, okay, in startup land. So founders fund took
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.120]   their just to make the math simple, because I'm going to get
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.880]   the numbers not exactly right, but like a $2 billion fund that
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.960]   they're going to break into to $1 billion funds. I think that's
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.600]   one story $1.8 billion fund, they're going to break it into
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.400]   to $900 million funds, it's their eighth fund, it's being
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.760]   cut in half, and it'll become eight and nine.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:04.400]   I think what that speaks to is valuations, and the marks that
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.800]   we think we have for existing companies and the future value
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:13.040]   that smart investors like this see all roads lead to it says
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.240]   we're in for a slog. And so trying to put a $2 billion fund
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.000]   to work doesn't seem to make a lot of economic sense to some of
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.080]   the smartest people in the room. So that's, that's that.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.960]   The second thing is there. It says, according to Axios, Peter
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:30.600]   teal led this charge, and he is the contrarians contrarian. He
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.720]   was the one according to actually, I said, led that cut
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.000]   of the fund size with summit founders fund, according to the
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.360]   reports, I'll say to him,
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.120]   I'll say the more important thing, which in Peter and I are
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.040]   in the same, we're the largest LPS in our funds. And so, you
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.400]   know, as the largest LPS in our funds, I think this is a no
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.960]   brainer decision. Number two, stripe basically takes a 50%
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.720]   haircut, which is the single best run, most highly valued
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.760]   company in Silicon Valley. Again, that's going to eviscerate
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.320]   the company, a lot of TV, pi and a lot of people's portfolios, a
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.800]   lot of theoretical money that LPS we're going to get. I think
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.120]   the third thing is, there's a person that went and filed a
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:20.800]   FOIA request that UC Berkeley to get sequoias returns. And it
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.840]   turns out that the best investor in the game, quote unquote,
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:30.960]   since 2018 has not really done that well. And I think in the
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.640]   University of California, invested over $800 million in
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:39.080]   sequoias since 2018. And I think his return, but some 40 million
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.120]   bucks on that number. And then the fourth, which just came out
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.040]   today is that Tiger wrote down the value of their private book
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:52.440]   by 33% for 2022. And so you know, I think Tigers a um,
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.160]   basically has gone from 100 billion to 50 billion in a year.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.200]   There's one more note to add to that YC basically let go of
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.520]   their growth team this week, Y Combinator, for people didn't
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.640]   know what was called the continuity fund, they were doing
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.720]   late stage investing, and that got cut, gosh, which is a signal
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.360]   and the 17 employees are gone now. And Gary Tan, I think is
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.680]   making the right decision. You know, they have to focus on what
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.640]   they're great at, which is the earliest stage of the company,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.000]   and they had conflicts with this one.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.280]   Look, this is the most interesting thing. For me in the
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.920]   following way, I think the Y Combinator unicorn hit rate is
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.600]   6%. Right. So every 100 companies that come out of YC,
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.520]   which costs only about $10 million to seed, right, six of
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.840]   them become worth a billion dollars or more. And obviously,
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.480]   some become worth much, much more. And so if you see how
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.960]   difficult it is, even for a growth fund that's attached to
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   that funnel, to be successful and make money, because obviously,
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.360]   if this thing was turning cash, you would not have cut it, I
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.280]   don't think anybody would do that. So I think it was a very
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.440]   challenging strategy at a challenging moment in time. And
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.640]   so I applaud these guys for having the discipline to do it.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.400]   But if you take them all in totality, it is a complicated
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.640]   place in venture capital and startup land. Holy mackerel,
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.960]   like, it's a reset a it's tough to make money be a lot of folks
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.600]   may not know exactly what they're doing. See, a bunch of
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.360]   valuations are totally wrong. And D, we're gonna have to start
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.520]   doing the cleanup work now resetting all of it, which just
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.520]   takes years as you guys remember, in part, it took us,
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.040]   took us five years to fix this.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.800]   It's a hard reset. Saks, what do you when you look at these in
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.960]   totality? What would you say?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.600]   Well, I agree with what Chamath just said. I mean, it's gonna be
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.920]   a hard period with a lot of resets, a lot of restructuring,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.920]   a lot of cap tables, there's a lot of mess to clean up. All of
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.440]   that being said, I think I'd rather be an investor today than
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.640]   an investor two years ago, or one year ago. Because at least
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.400]   the valuations have corrected to some degree. And then also, we
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.280]   have this really interesting AI wave happening now. And there's
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.440]   a lot of opportunities to invest in that new, you know, cycle. So
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.360]   at least there's like an interesting product cycle. It's
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.960]   getting me excited to go to work and see these new demos from all
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.720]   these different companies. Whereas, you know, you go back a
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.640]   year or two, and just the product innovation doesn't seem
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:18.680]   as world changing as it does now. So I think that as bad as
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:24.440]   things are, my guess is that the new vintages of VC are gonna be
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   better than, you know, call it 2021. For sure.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.280]   That's not going to be a high bar.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:37.880]   That's actually to Martha. This is a contradiction. Rash, rash.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.400]   This is the contradiction is that it felt better to be a VC
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.040]   in 2021. But in hindsight, we know that the vintage is going
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:49.520]   to be not good. Whereas today, hold on, but today, it feels not
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.440]   great to be a VC, but I think the vintages will be a lot
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:52.760]   better.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.880]   But anybody would tell you that at some point, you're going to
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.760]   have to divorce yourself from emotion to be a reasonably good
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.240]   investor over long periods of time. How many data points do we
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.280]   need to realize that too many people were put into this game
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.680]   that may not have known what they were doing. And we're going
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.240]   to have to go and work through all of those excesses. And I
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.320]   think it's just going to take a lot of time us limited partners
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.000]   are in a really difficult spot. European investors, I think are
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.680]   probably in a pretty difficult spot. There are a couple of
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.400]   bright, bright points around the world of folks that are still
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.760]   optimistic and doing well. I think Middle East is one.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.000]   Southeast Asia is another. But other than those, it's just a
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.640]   whole group of folks that just have to get completely
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.960]   reunderwritten from first principles. Even when you have
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.720]   an incredible platform like Sequoia, five years of no
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.960]   returns on $800 billion for somebody like UC Berkeley, what
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.800]   it really means without commenting on Sequoia's
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.120]   performance is that UC Berkeley is effectively out of business
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.520]   in being a limited partner for the foreseeable future. Well,
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.040]   right. And I think that has that has implication. So
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.400]   even if you think these vintages are great, I don't think they're
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.560]   open for business. And and frankly, if even if they wanted
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.440]   to be open for business, how do you go to an IC when they look
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.280]   at all of the totality of those dollars that have not made
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.240]   anything? How do you justify the next 800 billion? I just think
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:17.920]   it's very hard.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.720]   While I agree that LPS are out of it. I think the story was
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.640]   garbage because it all funds go through a J curve. And they're
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.800]   literally talking about the majority of the funds in that
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.560]   vintage 2008 2019 2020 21. They're all in literally the
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.640]   definition of the J curve, the third, fourth, fifth year,
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.120]   one of the most important things you need to be able to do is
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:41.680]   measure how long does it take the delta t to 90% of calling
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.400]   committed capital? And how long does it take the delta t to
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.600]   return one x DPI? I can tell you, Jason, if you're a
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.520]   reasonably good fund, those numbers should be between five
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.720]   and seven years for both,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.520]   which none of those funds have hit
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:01.200]   the average for a normal venture fund is around five to seven
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.120]   years to call 90% of the capital, and around five to
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.960]   seven years to return one x DPI. I'm just telling you that's
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.280]   what the average is. And if you talk to firms, so all I'm saying
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.120]   is there was a period of time, where in the absence of getting
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.160]   money back again, this is not a Sequoia thing. Yeah, it just
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.920]   means that there was an entire cohort and years of capital
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.360]   allocation that is not necessarily in a J curve. It's
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.400]   impaired. Because if after five years, you've, if after five
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.320]   years, you've returned nothing. Sometimes you just have to see
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.120]   the writing on the wall.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.920]   Saks explain the J curve one more time for folks. And then
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.880]   what is your analysis of that Sequoia story?
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.240]   Well, the J curve, the theory behind it is that when you start
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.880]   deploying a new fund, you're drawing fees down to pay for the
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.160]   firm and the investments you've made have not been marked up
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.000]   yet. So the value of the fund is actually going down because some
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.880]   of it's getting eaten up in fees. And you haven't really had
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.240]   a chance for any of those investments to be successful.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.560]   And then what happens happen early, right? I don't even know
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.840]   about that. I just think it's they haven't had a chance to get
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.120]   marked up. But then what happens is you start getting markups.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.680]   And now at least on paper, the value of the fund goes up. And
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.920]   then hopefully, those markups eventually turn into
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.480]   distributions, or DPI, like Jamal is talking about. Yeah, we
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.560]   have a vintage 2017 2018 fund that's actually fully returned
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.040]   at this point, you exited some secondaries or acquisitions? No,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.280]   we just had some, we just had some exits. But look, I think
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.360]   that is a little bit on the early slash lucky side. But we
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.840]   haven't really seen much of the J because, you know, you should
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.560]   be getting markups within two years, I think on your
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.960]   investments, if the companies are looking good, at least
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.280]   historically, that was the case.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.640]   Freeberg, any any thoughts on this collection of stories with
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:51.600]   venture, basically having the great venture reset? The end of
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.080]   the super cycle, the beginning of the next?
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.400]   It's happening.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.080]   Okay, we're in the thick of it.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.920]   But by the way, I would just go back to the point that with all
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.120]   the problems, Chamath is is talking about the reset and the
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.640]   wipeout that needs to occur. I think this is still that I think
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.480]   that's part of what makes this a better time. Absolutely. To be
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.240]   an investor.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.040]   This is what I'll say about that, Saks. I think I agree with
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:20.320]   you. I disconnect asset values and asset prices from
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.640]   fundamental business value being created. So the market bid stuff
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.560]   up, prices went up. That doesn't really mean that businesses
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.120]   aren't fundamentally good, that there aren't amazing technology
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.920]   businesses being built today that are going to affect
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.440]   billions of lives tomorrow. If you are tracking a public
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.440]   company stock, and you like the business, you spend time with
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.880]   management, you see what they're building, you see their revenues
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.680]   growing, their profits are growing, they're making great
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.680]   products, people are happy with what they're doing. But the
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.960]   stock's really expensive, you don't want to buy the stock.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.160]   Suddenly the stock drops by 80%. Nothing about the business has
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.760]   changed. It's just that the market is paying less to own
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.560]   shares in that company. That's a great time to buy that stock. I
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.800]   think that's the moment we're in in Silicon Valley. Everyone's
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   like, Oh my god, it's over. There's a things are terrible.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.400]   Just because the asset prices of the shares in companies has gone
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.720]   down, does not mean that the quality of the businesses has
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.840]   changed, or that there isn't fundamental value being created
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.960]   in Silicon Valley. In fact, the contrary point to sexist comment
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.280]   is that it is a great time to be buying these shares. And it is a
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.960]   great time to be investing. And it is a great time because as
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.320]   we've talked about countless times, there are extraordinary
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.320]   technologies, from AI, to biotech becoming software, to
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:43.680]   fusion to novel applications with AI and SAS, and on and on
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.800]   and on many of the amazing things we've talked about that I
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.560]   think can and will affect many industries and billions of lives
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.880]   are being built today, and they're not going to stop being
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.560]   built. And you can now buy the stock at 80% off. So, you know,
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   if you're investing today, and if you're a builder today, as
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.920]   long as the capital keeps flowing to support the building
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.360]   work, which I think to some degree it will because there's
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.560]   still enough of it sitting there. You're not going to have
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.920]   a lot of these crazy growthy rounds with high prices and all
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.320]   the nonsense that went on the last couple years. But there's
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.120]   certainly a lot of opportunity to greet real business value.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.720]   And right now an opportunity to buy shares pretty cheap, and
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.480]   participate meaningfully in that value creation.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.680]   I'll tell you the thing I'm seeing on the field and like
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.800]   playing the game on the field is something we've been talking
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.920]   about for the last year. We started a program called founder
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.640]   dot university and it's basically a 12 week course on
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.440]   like how to build your MVP. We had 350 people join the discount
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.560]   code people can use to this discount code. It's it's free
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.920]   for founders basically if they if it's free for founders if
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.120]   they come to the 12 weeks. But anyway, what I did was I said
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.000]   ww no, it's founder dot university because it's an
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.360]   extension but in the words of of sacks, let me finish. Please let
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.120]   me finish. What we did was we just said anybody who gets to an
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.960]   MVP and it's two or three builder co founders will give
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:02.680]   them a 25 k check. And I did 20 or 30 of these 25 k checks in
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.360]   the last couple of months of just the founders right now who
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.240]   have been laid off by other companies. They're dogged,
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:14.600]   pragmatic, absolutely customer centric product centric founders
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.320]   whereas the last five years have been filled with theatrics and
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.400]   white papers and ICOs and just nonsense and absurd valuations
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.000]   and people wanting credit for work not done. And now people
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.720]   are actually building MVPs and they're dogged product driven
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.320]   founders, customer centric mission driven founders and it
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.880]   feels to me that first
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.640]   10 all over again. That first part is so well said people
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.360]   wanted all this credit for work not done. And for progress not
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.600]   achieved. That game is over.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.240]   Finished, finished, which means if you are a product led CEO,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.560]   and you're a mission driven CEO who actually built something,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.240]   you stand out so much in this ecosystem, and have people
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.960]   begging for money, sending me long emails and decks and total
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   addressable market, I'm just like, can you just build a
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.080]   product and show me that you can actually deliver a product. And
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.360]   then we'll start the process of the rewards based system here,
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.560]   you know, the the reward based system in Silicon Valley is so
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.960]   magical when it works, you get money from founding university,
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.240]   or, you know, tech stars or Y Combinator, then go to a seed
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.120]   fund, then go to a series a fund, that milestone based
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.160]   funding was so broken. And now it's back. And it's so
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.640]   functional when it's working. It's just a magic of Silicon
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.400]   Valley is when people work and get rewards, work and get
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.760]   rewards. And it just creates this great pace and dynamic that
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.560]   I'm glad to see. Just as we wrap here, everybody's been begging
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.640]   for a science corner enough about the chaos in the world.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.720]   Everybody wants the sultan of science to tell us and educate
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.240]   us about something. And Saks needs to use the loo anyway. So
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.680]   let's do a science corner here. Room temperature, super
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.640]   conductors, you sent me a link, I read the abstract of this
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.840]   paper. And I don't know which language I need to put this into
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.000]   Google Translate, but I couldn't understand any of it. So I
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.240]   literally read the abstract and I was like, I couldn't get
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.640]   through the first two sentences without having to start doing
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.360]   searches. I'll start with just like the simple explainer on
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.360]   superconductor. He's, you know, materials that conduct
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.480]   electricity are called conductors. So conductors,
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.120]   electrons move through them like a copper wire. That's how
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.520]   electricity flows. And all conductors have some amount of
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.280]   resistance, meaning not all the electrons kind of flow through
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.360]   at a perfect rate, they bump into the atoms in the material
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.720]   in the wire, and they generate heat, you know, you've ever felt
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.560]   a wire while electricity is flowing through it, it gets hot,
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.880]   right. So that's because the conductor has some resistance,
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.120]   which means the electrons bump into the walls of the atoms in
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.840]   the material, they generate heat and you lose electricity, you
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:56.200]   lose energy, you lose power. And so in 1911, it was discovered
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.160]   when mercury was reduced to a very, very cold temperature,
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.840]   that there was a point at which the material conducted
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.160]   electricity with absolutely no resistance. So the electrons
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.800]   flowed through the material, completely unbounding on, you
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.040]   know, not bouncing into the material, not generating any
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:20.080]   heat. And having no resistance mean you're losing no power in
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.320]   transmission of that electricity, but a number number
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.560]   of other super interesting effects occur. Number one is
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.080]   that magnetic fields now reflect off of that metal perfectly. So
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.960]   if you put a magnet, you ever seen that image of a nick, we
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.080]   could probably pull one up in the YouTube video, we put a
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.080]   magnet on top of a superconductor, it actually
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.280]   floats. Because the magnetic field like the north and the
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.920]   north push against each other and it floats up. So
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.640]   superconducting materials kind of became this fascination in
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.760]   the early 20th century, that oh my god, if we can actually make
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.400]   materials that superconduct, there are all these amazing
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.160]   benefits. One of the benefits is you could have no loss in
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.800]   electricity being transmitted. Today, 15% of power is lost in
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.560]   the transmission from the power station to your home. You could
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.240]   also do interesting things like create maglev or frictionless
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.720]   trains that float, you know, like magnets floating off the
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.720]   ground on top of a superconducting track. And by
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.000]   having no friction, you could push the track the train once
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.160]   and you wouldn't need to use any energy to move it along. So you
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.000]   could have basically powerless transportation. You could have
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.960]   really powerful new microprocessors. So a
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.760]   superconductor microprocessor instead of a traditional
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:32.400]   semiconductor microprocessor would use just 1% of the energy
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.920]   of a semiconductor microprocessor. Think about
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.400]   that all the AI stuff we're talking about all the chips that
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.560]   we're talking about dropping the energy needs by 99% if those
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.640]   chips were made from a superconducting material. And
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.680]   one of the more interesting applications of superconducting
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.320]   materials could be infinite battery storage. So you could
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.280]   take a superconductor, turn it into a coil, and the electricity
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.800]   would just flow through it infinitely because it would
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.520]   never turn into heat. And then when you're ready for that
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.080]   power, you just plug in and you get the power out the actual
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.120]   loss of energy in a superconductor battery, less
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   than 5%. And that's compared with, you know, significantly
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.400]   more energy loss used in chemical systems. And you
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.080]   wouldn't need to kind of get all the materials that we're
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.040]   struggling to get now to generate batteries. So the idea
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.080]   of generating like superconductors and industrial
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.280]   scale has always been super interesting today, the way that
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.800]   we generate superconducting materials is we have to make a
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.280]   material super, super cold. In 1987, a physicist named Chu
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.160]   developed one of the first ceramic superconductors where
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.280]   they discovered a new way of generating superconductivity. It
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.480]   wasn't just taking a metal and cooling it down very, very cold
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.840]   because when you get it very, very cold, the atom stopped
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.000]   moving, and the electrons inside pair up and it's called Cooper
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.560]   pairing and they flow through. And he said, we could actually
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.360]   do this with a hotter temperature. And he demonstrated
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.920]   this in a ceramic yttrium barium copper oxide super confusing
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.360]   name. But basically, he took a bunch of materials and baked
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.560]   them in an oven. And they turn into this really interesting
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.560]   material that became superconducting. And then the
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.680]   race was on. Because what he did is he made a superconductor that
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.080]   could superconduct at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.840]   And liquid nitrogen is really cheap. So we can just use and
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.440]   that's actually how all MRI machines run today. If you have
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.160]   superconductors that reflect the magnetic fields in the soup in
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.880]   the MRI machine, and they're using liquid nitrogen to stay
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.000]   cool. And so there's a lot of industrial applications today
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.520]   that use superconducting materials using liquid nitrogen.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.080]   But in order for us to do all the stuff I mentioned, like
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.440]   maglev trains and infinite battery storage, and
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:26.200]   superconducting microprocessors, we have to get superconductors,
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.760]   we have to discover a material that can superconduct at room
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.800]   temperature, so that we can sit with it in a computer on our
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.520]   desktop, or we can have it run on a railroad track. Or, you
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.920]   know, we can put it in our backyard to store energy. And
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.720]   there's been this race, and there's all these different
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.240]   classes of materials that physicists and material
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.840]   scientists have spent decades trying to figure out what can
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.760]   superconduct at room temperature, we started with
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.760]   metals, you know, copper, and we tried carbon nanotubes and
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.120]   fullerene tubes, we had all these different ceramics, like
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.920]   like was like I talked about, and there have been literally
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.780]   10s of 1000s of ceramics that people bake in ovens and try and
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.200]   see how superconducting they are. Basically, you take the
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.040]   material, and you cool the temperature and you measure the
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.840]   resistance. And as soon as it hits superconductivity, boom,
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.680]   there's this magic moment where it drops to zero, and it becomes
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.840]   superconducting. And there's this big changeover effect. So
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.240]   everyone's trying to find that temperature, which can happen at
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.880]   room temperature. And people have found superconductivity on
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.200]   the surface of DNA and organic molecules. But you can't scale
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:31.360]   that people have found, you know, superconductivity and all
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.100]   these weird kind of material on the surface of things, but no
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.100]   one's ever been able to industrialize it. In 2015, there
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.660]   was a new kind of material called a hydride, which is
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.440]   basically taking a thin metal and putting it in hydrogen gas
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.060]   and kind of baking it for a couple of days, and the
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.580]   hydrogen sticks to the metal. And then you would use this
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:53.940]   hydride as a new kind of conductor and hydrides, it turned
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.660]   out had really good superconducting potential, they
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.500]   would superconduct at room temperature, but they needed
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.000]   super high pressure. So you'd actually have to leave them in
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.520]   like, something that's like hundreds of times the pressure
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.300]   of the atmosphere. And so that that's not really technically
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.600]   and industrially feasible either. So this guy named Ranga
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.600]   Diaz published a paper a couple of weeks ago that got a ton of
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.000]   press, and a ton of controversy. And basically, he said, Look,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.880]   I've got this new hydride. And it's I've got this really, you
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.360]   know, weird metal that no one ever talks about. And I've baked
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.800]   it with this with hydrogen gas. And this hydride can actually
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.460]   superconduct at, you know, room temperature, and at only one
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.900]   gigapascal, which is still greater pressure than room
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.960]   temperature. But it basically starts to show on the chart of
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.500]   are we getting there? Can we actually get there that maybe we
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.120]   are. And so this paper was published in nature a couple of
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:50.020]   weeks ago, and it got a ton of a ton of coverage because
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.740]   everyone's like, Oh, my gosh, the problem is this particular
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:59.060]   individual. You know, the lead researcher Ranga Diaz on the on
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.560]   the paper, he's pretty controversial, because he made a
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.160]   room temperature superconducting claim back in 2020, in a paper
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:10.080]   he published in nature. And after he made that that claim, a
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.360]   lot of scientists tried to replicate what he did, and they
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.640]   were not able to. And then the journal retracted his paper. And
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.860]   he had a method that he took data noise out of the
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.320]   measurement system he was using. And the way that he took the
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.680]   data noise out, people said actually skewed the results and
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.900]   made it look like it was superconducting when maybe it
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.880]   wasn't. And he actually had a talk that he did that was
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.600]   published on YouTube, a year later, where he said he raised
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.360]   $20 million from Sam Altman and Daniel Eck and a bunch of other
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.940]   investors. And it turns out that also wasn't true. And then he
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.800]   came back and said, Well, I didn't actually raise the money.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.580]   I was talking with them about raising the money. So this guy's
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:47.680]   kind of a sketchy character in the space. But the temperature
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.700]   at which he was able to generate or claims to have generated and
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:55.200]   he did get peer review and did get published. A superconductor
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.720]   is at room temperature, it's at slightly high pressure. But if
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.160]   it's real, and it does get repeated, it's one of the next
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.200]   steps that we're almost going to be getting to this point of true
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.000]   room temperature superconducting materials. And then this whole
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.120]   industry will blow up transmission lines, battery
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.920]   storage, maglev trains, superconducting microprocessors.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.600]   You know, many new industries can and will emerge from this
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.780]   material discovery if it's proven to be real. So you know,
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.460]   it's a super interesting storyline, a lot of people in
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.420]   the material science world and scientists, chemists, physicists
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:32.900]   are kind of going crazy about this. And there was a survey
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.580]   done by quantum magazine. And half the scientists were like,
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.700]   this is bullshit. And the other half was like, this is going to
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.220]   change the world. So we don't really know yet where this is
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.040]   all going to settle out. But I thought it was worth kind of
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.260]   talking about and bringing it up. Because if room temperature
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.060]   superconductivity is really realized in the next decade,
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.320]   it's another one of these kind of black swan technology
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.920]   discoveries that we none of us are thinking about right now.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.520]   But it totally transforms all these markets. And very quickly
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.600]   kind of increases like we were talking about earlier
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.340]   productivity makes renewable energy super, super cheap, makes
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:06.680]   computing power 99% less power intensive, AI chips will explode
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.780]   using this technology. So a lot of super interesting applications
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.400]   if room temperature superconductivity comes to
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.280]   light. Super interesting story. I thought we should share it and
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:14.700]   talk about
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.060]   yeah, Chamath, I would love to get your insights on it and then
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.280]   sacks, I would like to understand how many emails and
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.380]   what you ordered from Uber eats during that segment. Go ahead,
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:22.600]   Chamath.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:27.200]   Venkat Viswanathan, who runs a battery group at Carnegie Mellon
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.640]   introduced me to Ranga two years ago, me and my partner, Jay, we
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.960]   were like, holy shit, this is outrageous. And we tried to spin
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:40.360]   it out into an actual company. But the University of Rochester
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.280]   blocked it. And so we've been following this guy for two years
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.280]   and all the trials and tribulations, but it's a really,
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.160]   really exciting thing. If it does come to you got capital
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.160]   blocked, explain why you would get capital blocked in a
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.440]   situation like that. Why wouldn't they allow you to spin
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.600]   it up? It is interesting, because like typically
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.080]   universities have a tech transfer office, and you can do
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.760]   these deals pretty cleanly. So you know, when you go to Stanford,
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.400]   the tech transfer office is quite sophisticated at MIT, it's
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.840]   quite sophisticated. There are these pretty standardized deals
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.240]   and, and what is the standard deal? Explain to the audience
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.520]   how a tech transfer deal would work? And how does the
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.720]   university make money from it?
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.720]   If you're a prof and you invent something, or even if you're a
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.120]   student, it's technically owned by the school. And so if you
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.000]   want to commercialize it, you go to them and use basically say,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.400]   here's a capital partner of mine, and we want to go and
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.280]   start a company around it. And what they will normally say is,
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.240]   Okay, great, give us a piece of equity and give us some royalty
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.920]   in some cases, depending on how much especially the equity tends
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.920]   to be in the mid single digit percentages, the royalties tend
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.600]   to be in the mid single digit percentages, it depends on how
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:48.280]   much you're making. So okay, yeah, call it 5567%. But it can
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.560]   be a lot when you think about a, you know, a school like Stanford
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.240]   who's spinning out hundreds of these things a year. But if
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.680]   you're, if you're a school that doesn't historically do a lot of
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.720]   tech transfer, or has a lot of cutting edge R&D, you wouldn't
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:08.400]   have that team. And so Rochester didn't necessarily have it now
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.080]   look, Ranga is probably getting bombarded by 30 other people
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.120]   who'll pay 10 times more than what I was trying to pay 18
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.360]   times. So that's an interesting thing. And I think there'll be
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.320]   some there'll be some,
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.200]   what's the greatest Does anybody know what the top tech
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.960]   transfers of all time were like, was Google a tech transfer
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.680]   freeberg? Do you know like, yeah, because he drank was out
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.880]   of the what it's down on a day. No, yeah, Larry and Larry and
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.440]   Sergey gave Stanford I think one of the Stanford Yeah, they
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.400]   gave him a percent. Yeah.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.160]   Wow.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.040]   Because back rub was written while Larry was a PhD there. So
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:43.320]   they had some part of it. Carnegie Mellon ranked as top
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.800]   tech transfer university I'm just seeing here in terms of the
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.040]   rankings, University of Florida, Columbia, Stanford, Harvard,
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.880]   it's very, some of them are terrible, like, and some of them
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.280]   are cronyism. So like, you go to some of the universities and the
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.400]   tech transfer offices have deep relationships with certain VCs
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.440]   and investors that they'll only work. And they always get first
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.520]   picks and first dibs, and they're super tight with them.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.720]   They don't run a real market process. And then some tech
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.920]   transfer offices just give away the farm for nothing. And then
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.120]   some tech transfer offices think that they own it and they should
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.960]   get paid 60% royalties for the thing. It's all over the map.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.120]   And some of them are sophisticated and some of them
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.160]   are not. So it's it's actually quite surprising, J. Cal, how
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.240]   different all the universities are in terms of their level of
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:30.760]   sophistication and the types of deals they'll do. But I will say
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.600]   this work in superconducting research. It's another good
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.920]   example going up to going back to the point a couple episodes
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.280]   ago about the importance of fundamental research and the
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.000]   importance of, you know, the support from academic
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.160]   institutions and governments and other aspects when you're still
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.160]   not sure what the technology is, that to do that fundamental
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.240]   discovery work, I think is a good collective social benefit.
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.320]   And then to industrialize it and commercialize it requires, I
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.720]   think, a market based approach, which is you take that
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.960]   capability, try and build a business find customers make
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.360]   money. And that's really how you get it to be funded to be
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.800]   scaled. Because you're never gonna you shouldn't have to put
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.880]   you know, government and academic money behind that sort
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.920]   of effort, but private market participants should. And so you
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:16.200]   know, it's interesting. I mean, I think I'm not holding my
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.760]   breath. I've been, you know, I did a science project in 1993,
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.400]   when I was probably 12 or 13 years old, on superconductors.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.600]   And I got a yttrium barium copper oxide disk. And I got some
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.040]   liquid nitrogen from UCLA. And I poured it on the disk, and I
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.640]   floated a magnet above it. And I had a poster board and a computer
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.680]   presentation back then. And I was super enthralled about the
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.160]   future of superconductors. And exactly what I said today is
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.240]   what I said back in 1993. So you know, 30 years ago,
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.600]   it was so busy dating, I didn't think you had time for
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.000]   superconductor experiments.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.320]   Yeah, look, I don't think I don't think that this stuff has
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.600]   really, it's been, it's been like fusion, it's always been a
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.720]   promise around the corner. physicists have always had hope
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.600]   we've taken incremental steps towards it. But it's always felt
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.280]   like one of those things where you're always getting 50% closer
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.960]   to the wall. It's like you're never actually reaching the wall.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.120]   And so anecdotally, one, yeah, by the way, I will say one area
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.640]   that that that a lot of people think holds a lot of promise for
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.680]   superconducting research is in quantum computing, because you
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.440]   can actually model on a molecular level, what might be
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.400]   going on. Right now, the BCS theory is this theory on Cooper
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.960]   pairing that happens in ceramics is the only way that we really
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.720]   understand how superconducting actually works, why it works,
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.280]   why there's no resistance at certain temperatures for certain
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.040]   types of materials. For most materials, we have no friggin
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.240]   clue why it happens. We don't understand the physics of it.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.000]   There's something going on on a quantum mechanical level that we
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.040]   just don't get. And so if we can understand it better through
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.280]   quantum modeling, using quantum computers, all of a sudden, we
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.520]   may be able to actually start to come up with ideas for molecules
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.160]   and crystal structure that would allow us to make superconducting
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.000]   material that we simply don't have enough time in our lifetime
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.600]   to run all the experiments in a lab today, and we can simulate
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.560]   it. And so that's why quantum computing could play a real role
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.240]   in advancing our ability to do discovery and superconducting
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.240]   materials. And like I talked about, these are like not just
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.120]   one, but like two or three order of magnitude improvements in the
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.760]   efficiency of certain systems of industry on earth today. So it
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.920]   shows how the compounding benefits of technology and
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.880]   things you cannot see around the corner can suddenly cause these
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.960]   explosive growth moments in technology in an industry. I
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.440]   don't know what when quantum computing gets here, when it
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.760]   gets here, it might discover superconducting. And then when
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   that gets discovered, boom, energy costs drop by 99%
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.560]   computing goes up by 100 fold. So there's these amazing things
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.000]   that are still like in front of us that each one of which could
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.480]   be you know, really great exponential triggering events.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.880]   And we're seeing a little milestone today. But yeah, I
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:34.160]   don't know.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.960]   Saks reaction.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.160]   Sounds good.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.480]   Saks, how many moves did you play in your 12?
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.960]   Chess games with
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.840]   Friberg was talking about
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.800]   superconducting. How many points did you go up? All right, look,
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.040]   I got shit. Let's go.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:57.040]   Oh, sex. All right, listen, this has been a great episode. Thanks
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.680]   for the best comment on the Atlantic article that says Ron
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:06.000]   DeSantis has peaked already. Oh, don't worry. Oh, don't do it.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.320]   Don't do why you got to troll him.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.720]   See that but it's in the Atlantic. Oh, you want to know
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.480]   why the Atlantic suddenly has turned on him is because they're
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.000]   the biggest backers of the war. They those guys have all these
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.680]   like neocons over there. And so he gave a statement saying that
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.040]   you know, our support for Ukraine shouldn't be a blank
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.200]   check and some other comments expressing, let's say
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.520]   skepticism of what we're doing over there. And that was totally
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.920]   unacceptable to them. So all these neocons are registering
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.720]   disappointment. But I would argue that's an electoral asset,
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.600]   not a liability.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.200]   I have a prediction given what's going on with these banks and
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.800]   what's going on in this kind of a I think we all agree, the soft
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.760]   landing concept is over, we're going to be in a recession. The
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.640]   war is going to end there because we're not funding this
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.360]   and American the American public is not going to want to see
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.840]   10s of billions of dollars go into Ukraine. And to find to
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.320]   fund this war in year two or three
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.080]   hundreds of billions.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.280]   I'm just saying it every month. Yeah.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.480]   I know the spending run rate of this war is actually greater
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.120]   than what we did in Afghanistan and Afghanistan ended up being
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.360]   a 20 year multi trillion dollar operation that just flushed all
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.440]   that money down the drain. So yeah,
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.680]   I mean, we're in a greater run rate than Afghanistan. Yeah.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.000]   Do we know what the monthly run rate is for this? Oh my god,
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.400]   how did they pass back?
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:28.360]   We've appropriated over 130 billion Chamath and Afghanistan
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.760]   we spent 2 trillion over 20 years. So 100 million a year run
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.840]   rate. And this is what a monumental waste of money that
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.600]   was and now look at the financial crisis we're in. Can
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.480]   you imagine if we could have 2 trillion back? I mean, all these
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:40.960]   trillions
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.160]   we take it back instantly, we would take that
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.720]   all those trillions and trillions we squandered on
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.120]   stuff that didn't matter. And now we're paying the price for
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.040]   it. That could be education could be universal health care
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.080]   can be paying down the debt,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.480]   how about paying down the debts, we don't have all this
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.120]   inflation.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.520]   Exactly. Let's think logically here, the number one issue for
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.040]   this country in the next election, I am with Friedberg
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.800]   his great prediction from the year end show is we need a
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.760]   president, we need an administration that is fiscally
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.200]   responsible, and controls the balance sheet in a logical
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.440]   fashion, like the last two administrations have not seemed
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.320]   capable of doing I am with Friedberg single issue voter
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.400]   balance the budget, get spending under control, austerity
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.520]   measures, hashtag. Alright, for the Sultan of science,
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.720]   sorry, what's that? Can you repeat that?
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.480]   What I wanted to say, Chamath is there are there any plugs for
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.680]   the remaining part of the episode? Mr. Beast is curing
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.960]   blindness and buying people's shoes? Has he been cancelled
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.240]   yet?
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.000]   Thanks. Aren't you excited about superconductors and the benefit
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.360]   for AI and energy storage and energy costs and humanity? Yeah,
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.000]   what does it do to burn rate of a SAS?
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.960]   Yeah, but I'm not I'm not like an expert at assessing like hard
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.920]   science or hard tech. I mean, I'm a software investor.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.440]   I'm just a simple man. I'm just a software investor.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.760]   Alright, everybody for the rain man himself, David sacks, the
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:02.320]   dictator Chamath Pali hoppity. And the Sultan of science, the
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.800]   prince of panic attacks no more. Mr. David Friedberg. I'm the
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.960]   world's greatest moderator. Undisputed. Congratulations,
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.240]   everybody. On another successful episode and Friedberg when are
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:18.240]   we locking in the date for all in summit 2023? My replies my dms
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.680]   are filled people want to know. Do you have the date?
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.160]   Soon soon we had a parking issue where they don't want us parking
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:27.040]   there. So as soon as we don't need to park there. Everybody
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.720]   that's what we told so now they've gone back to their
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.160]   committee to get approval for us doing it without parking and just
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.800]   doing no parking or walking shuttles or people? Uber, Uber,
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.960]   Uber, Uber. Let's get that we should hopefully if if they
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.360]   accept it, then we are okay. How many shuttles do we have to take
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.920]   to Uranus? Oh, yeah, exactly. How am I the prince of panic
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.760]   attacks? I think you're the king of caps locks at this point.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.800]   They were called me J caps. J caps was the best one I heard
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.400]   talking about panic attacks. Jake held this weekend, man
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.400]   panicking, panicking. I was a sheer terror. Sure. I have
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.600]   literally gotten rid of the caps lock. Everybody relax. You can
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.480]   follow me twitter.com slash Jason. We'll see you all next
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.320]   time. Bye bye. Bye bye.

[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:17.760]   we open sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.

[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.640]   driveway
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:40.040]   should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:40.440]   because they're all
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.760]   like this like sexual tension that they just need to release
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.160]   somehow.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.960]   What you're about to be your fee.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.720]   Good. Good. We need to get merch.
