[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   We have eschatology questions today and on Monday.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   Here's the first one.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.800]   "Good morning, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.920]   I am a high school science teacher in Alabama.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920]   I love your passion and Christ-centered joy.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.180]   I write because I recently had a student tell me that her church believes that the second
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.680]   coming of Jesus has already occurred.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.380]   She said that they believe Revelation was written about the sacking of Jerusalem by
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.040]   Rome in 70 AD.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.560]   I was caught off guard because I had never heard anyone say that Jesus had already returned.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   I believe the term for that belief is preterist.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.040]   Have you come across this position and how do you respond to it?"
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.400]   Yes, I have heard this position, but let me see if I can distinguish between a view that
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.640]   says the second coming of Christ has already happened and the view that sees some of the
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.980]   book of Revelation as referring to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.080]   The view that you are referring to, namely that the second coming has already happened,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.720]   is a very rare view.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.160]   I don't think it has ever been considered orthodox.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.440]   It is sometimes called full or hyper-preterism.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.520]   Now, preterism is the view of Revelation, the book of Revelation, that argues that much
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.440]   or all of it lies in the past from our perspective, not the future.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   Preter, Latin for past, hence preterism.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.400]   It was future from the standpoint of John's writing, but now it has already happened.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.920]   So full preterism, hyper-preterism, this rare and unorthodox view, I think, thinks that
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.520]   all of the book of Revelation, including the second coming, has already happened, meaning
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.680]   that the coming of Christ is interpreted in such a way that it only refers to his power
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.240]   being shown in various historical manifestations, like the sack of Jerusalem.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.920]   He's not hidden somewhere in the world.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   You can get that out of your mind.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.260]   That's not what they mean.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.840]   He's not like hiding out somewhere in the world because he's already come back.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.320]   He's in heaven and has "come back" in the sense that he showed up in judgment at the
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.560]   destruction of Jerusalem.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.400]   Now what you might call partial preterism, that's the more common and I would say orthodox
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.040]   kind, doesn't think that the second coming of Christ has already happened, even though
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.200]   much of the events described in the Revelation have already been fulfilled in history, including
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.960]   the destruction of Jerusalem.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.000]   Now the question I'm being asked, however, by this teacher, is how I would respond to
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.640]   a student who says that her church believes that Jesus has already come back and there's
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:28.080]   no future hope of Christ coming on the clouds personally, bodily, to establish his kingdom.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.680]   And the way I would respond is to say to her, "The book of Revelation has perplexed Christians
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.240]   for 2,000 years, and I probably won't be able to set you straight on this point from the
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   book of Revelation alone.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.360]   Instead, what I would like you to do with me is to look at a few passages of Scripture
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:05.600]   in the letters of Paul, which I think simply will not fit into the scheme that says there's
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   no future coming of Christ in judgment and salvation."
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.620]   And I would take her to 1 and 2 Thessalonians, probably, not only, but first.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.000]   In 1 Thessalonians 4, 13, Paul is trying to comfort believers who have lost loved ones
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.080]   in death, and the way he encourages them is not by pointing to the fact that there's going
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.200]   to be a sack of Jerusalem someday.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:46.480]   His way of encouraging them is by showing that those who have died will not miss out
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.000]   on the coming of Christ because they're going to be raised from the dead so that together
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.400]   with the living, they will meet the Lord in the air.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.840]   So he says, "We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.360]   you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.440]   For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so through Jesus, God will bring
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.320]   with him those who have fallen asleep.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.040]   For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.800]   until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep."
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.480]   Verse 16, "For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.280]   voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God."
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.160]   Let me pause right there.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.480]   This trumpet blast at the coming is the way Paul describes the resurrection in 1 Corinthians
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.080]   15, 52.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.200]   It's not a point in history, like a battle against a city.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.080]   It's the end of history as we know it, marked by the resurrection of all believers who have
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.240]   died.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.000]   Now he goes on, verse 17, "And the dead in Christ will rise first.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.840]   Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.400]   to meet the Lord in the air.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.600]   And so we will always be with the Lord."
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.720]   Now that's the description of a decisive coming of Christ that gathers all believers
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.120]   dead and alive into one people under the reign of Christ.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:40.280]   It simply will not do to say that this is somehow a reference to an unseen visitation
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.440]   of Christ at some point in the past.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.920]   And then he gets even more graphic in 2 Thessalonians where he says in chapter 1, "The Lord Jesus
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:59.280]   will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.040]   on those who do not know God, on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence of the
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.240]   Lord and from the glory of his might when he comes on that day to be glorified in his
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.880]   saints and to be marveled at among all who have believed because our testimony to you
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.760]   was believed."
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:34.280]   Or as he says in verse 6, "God will repay with affliction those who afflict you and
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.000]   grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.540]   heaven with his mighty angels."
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:53.840]   This is God's judgment on all unbelievers and his rescue of all Christ's people.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:02.040]   In 2 Thessalonians 2, Paul argues that the day of the Lord cannot have already come like
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   this.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.360]   There were people in Thessalonica who were thinking, "It's already here, it's already
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   here."
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.000]   And he says, "For that day will not come unless the man of lawlessness is revealed,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.880]   the son of destruction, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.160]   bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming."
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:33.800]   And I would say to my young student, I don't think these and many other references to the
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:40.960]   second coming of Christ in the New Testament can be legitimately interpreted as somehow
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:48.200]   symbolic references to the destruction of Jerusalem 2,000 years ago.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.080]   Throughout the New Testament, the second coming of Christ is presented as a precious and blessed
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:04.580]   hope of resurrection for all believers and relief for all the living saints and rescue
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.080]   from the wrath to come.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.800]   Over and over, the New Testament pictures the people of Christ waiting eagerly for what
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.480]   Christ will do for us at his second coming, not for something a long time ago.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.800]   What will he do for us at his second coming?
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.160]   And here's an example I'll close with.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:33.440]   Philippians 3.20, "Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:42.720]   Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body by
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.480]   the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself."
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:56.960]   And I would look at my student friend right in the eye and say, "Neither you nor I have
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:06.760]   such a glorious body yet, because the Savior has not yet returned, but he will, and that's
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.760]   our hope."
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.180]   And as the end of the Bible teaches us to pray, "Amen, come Lord Jesus."
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.720]   We long for that day to come.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.640]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.600]   We break for the weekend and return on Monday with another eschatology question.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.880]   So the return of Christ has not happened yet.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.400]   It's coming in the future.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.960]   So what signs will signal to us that his return is imminent?
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   That's our lead-off question next week.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll be joined again with Pastor John on Monday in the studio
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.340]   for that one.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.080]   We'll see you then, and have a great weekend.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:56.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
