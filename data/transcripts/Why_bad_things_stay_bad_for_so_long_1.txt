[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about why bad things stay bad for so long.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.520]   Well, the other night I had drinks with an old friend.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.840]   She told me her husband had struck her to the ground during some petty argument about coming home late from work.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.600]   She showed me a snapshot on her phone of the bruises she sustained on her arm during the altercation.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.040]   The black and blue was obvious. There was no doubt about it.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.080]   Instead of being shocked at what she told me, I started feeling angry.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   90% of my anger was directed towards him.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.720]   But then the remaining 10% was frustration towards her for not reporting him or just leaving him.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.200]   You see, this was not the first time my friend said her husband was violent towards her.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.920]   This was the third time in one year. And who knows how many other times they fought without her telling me.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.280]   And when I asked her why not just get a divorce after seven years of marriage, this is what she told me.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.000]   "Sam, I can't get a divorce because of the social stigma surrounding a divorce.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.680]   I'm already 37 years old and we're trying to have a baby.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.520]   Do you really expect me to start over? My family and friends wouldn't understand.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.440]   Although we've got into many fights before, he's also been quite caring and a good man.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.520]   He has a stable job, makes good money, and we live in an overall comfortable lifestyle.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.840]   I'm also not willing to throw away this relationship. I think we can make things work."
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.240]   I was just sad. Sad to hear her response because I can never stick around in an abusive marriage.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.360]   Just like I would never stick around in a bad job situation.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.840]   After all, I'm the one who negotiated an exit within six months after I decided I had enough of work BS.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.400]   My friend has a great job making over $160,000 a year and she would do just fine
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.360]   leaving her husband and living by herself in the Bay Area as she gathers her life up and starts over.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.040]   She'd also receive some additional financial assets in a divorce.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.120]   But I'm not in her shoes and I have a different type of personality.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.560]   It's easy for me to tell her to get a divorce because I'm not the one getting it.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.200]   I'm just afraid she'll be stuck with him for the rest of her life because she fears how society will judge her more than she
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.440]   cares about her happiness. I feel strongly she will look back on her life and regret
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   not having made the decision to leave him.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.560]   Sticking up for yourself can be scary. Change is extremely stressful.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.720]   These are the risks we all must take to get out of bad situations.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.920]   And it's so sad that the fear of society's disapproval has kept her in a bad situation for so long.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.400]   I've encouraged her to at least go to a marriage counselor because spousal abuse is absolutely unacceptable.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.080]   But she hasn't, they haven't, and I'm just gonna keep on pushing. Because at the end of the day I care about her
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000]   and I care about her well-being and this has got to stop.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.640]   And let me tell you a personal story. About eight months ago a new podcaster reached out to see if I wanted to be on his
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.880]   show focusing on financial independence.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.600]   I politely declined because I didn't know him or the show well at the time.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.840]   Just for reference, someone reaches out to me about twice every two weeks or three weeks to do a verbal or written interview.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.080]   Many are new podcasters that haven't been around very long and to manage my inbound requests
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.040]   I have a general rule that the podcaster or blogger be at least one year old before I say yes.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.320]   Over the past ten years since 2009 I've noticed many folks have good intentions,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.000]   they start something but then they kind of disappear after six months to a year for whatever reason.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.440]   So I'm just trying to be efficient and protect my time.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.960]   Several months later the new podcaster again asked if I wanted to join his show
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.800]   to discuss retiring early in a high-cost area of the country.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.080]   I declined again because I had other priorities and I've talked about this topic well enough.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.360]   I like going on podcasts where finance isn't the main topic because I'm trying to get out of the echo chamber here.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.800]   And then several months later he asked me again
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.800]   whether he can host me on his show, this time on the topic of racism,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.520]   probably because he had seen my post on the importance of feeling consistently uncomfortable for personal and financial growth.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.880]   The post was about my experience
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.440]   facing racism and bullying in Virginia as a high schooler and college student and I was wondering with my wife whether
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.720]   maybe we should go back to Virginia. Not only can we save like 30 to 40 percent on living expenses,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.800]   but we can subject our son to a more harsher reality of life growing up as a minority in America.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.720]   And the conclusion for that post is we're probably not going to go to Virginia because we're comfortable here in San Francisco
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.040]   and we're probably gonna go to Honolulu, but it was a thought process to think about how, you know, being uncomfortable and facing adversity
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.480]   helps grow you as a person.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.000]   So given he wanted to talk about racism and I had a lot of experience about that and I feel passionate about
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.640]   fighting against racism and fighting for equality, I said sure,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:15.680]   let's have a conversation and then maybe the conversation can foster more discussion, more understanding and more harmony in society.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.360]   Further, the podcaster was white, his co-host is white,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.840]   his audience is mostly white and his guests are mostly white.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.040]   So I thought hey as a minority living in a high-cost area of the country,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.680]   this could be good so we can talk a little bit more and have more understanding.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.640]   So we had a great conversation about an hour, talked about my experience growing up, how to deal with racism, how to go forward and
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   the podcast was set to be published and then he, a week before publishing,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   contacted me and said hey, I need you to apologize to this person.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.160]   And I was like which person and he said the person that was basically bullying you online and saying bad things.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   And I'm thinking to myself, you mean the
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   internet troll that has been trolling my Facebook page and Financial Samurai for months and saying bad things?
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.640]   Absolutely not. I'm definitely not gonna apologize for standing up for myself and writing a post about
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.280]   dealing with internet trolls and so forth.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   Given the size of Financial Samurai, the site and its corresponding social media channels consistently get
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.480]   racial slurs hurled my way. It's pretty sad, but it's constant and it's consistent.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   I'm also often told how to think and what to do by other people who are
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.760]   mostly not like me and whether it's the internet retirement police or trolls in general,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.320]   there has been a non-stop parade of haters since I started the site in 2009. If you're not a minority,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.400]   it's hard to imagine what it's like going through constant racial badgering everywhere you go.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.440]   I'm talking at work, on a bus, at a baseball game, at a pit stop, on vacation and online.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.560]   Just believe me when I say that it is constant and
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.120]   we just learn how to deal with it by either paying it no heed or by eventually fighting back.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.440]   And yeah, it is sad and annoying, but when my son was born in 2017, something changed in me.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.200]   No longer was I willing to accept online bullying and racial slurs because I don't want my son growing up in this type of environment.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.880]   The papa bear in me came out and I needed to stand up to the stuff like I did in school.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.600]   So the end result was that the podcaster who repeatedly asked me to come on to his show
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.760]   decided not to run the podcast on my experience dealing with racism
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.400]   because he disapproved of me standing up against an internet troll who was hurling insults my way.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.840]   As he was a relatively new podcaster,
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.360]   he was too afraid of getting bullied himself and judged by others in the community
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.520]   who disapproved of me standing up for myself and for my family.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.680]   He felt that if he published our interview, he would lose some of his audience and therefore lose potential revenue and
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.760]   growth. And I totally get it. As a creator, growth of an audience and the money that goes with it are the two things you
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.120]   want the most, especially as a podcaster and a blogger and so forth.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.680]   A lot of people also have the need to feel universally loved, which is something I don't have.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.360]   But this is when I realized why bad things stay bad for so long.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.280]   Too many people are too afraid to stand up for themselves and to stand up for others who stand up for themselves
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.000]   out of fear of being persecuted by the very people who bully others.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.320]   The end result is a show that turns into an echo chamber of ideas and opinions because everybody looks and thinks alike.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.240]   And I hope to goodness that Financial Samurai
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.440]   never becomes an echo chamber where I'm not accepting of different perspectives and opinions.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.240]   If you can speak your mind in a civil way and explain your background on why you think the way you do,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.600]   I'm all for it. I want you to write a guest post.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.640]   I want you to comment and tell me why your way of thinking is probably better. This is the only way we're going to learn.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.360]   Look at what's going on in the NBA right now. As soon as Houston Rockets general manager Darryl Morey tweeted,
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.640]   "Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong," the lucrative relationship between the NBA and China began to disintegrate.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.760]   Given the China market is worth roughly 4 billion to the NBA or about 1 billion a year,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   it was fascinating to see how some owners, coaches, players, and the commissioner either said nothing or
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.920]   threw Darryl under the bus or groveled for forgiveness.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.600]   If you care about your reputation and want money, sending one-liners on social media about a
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.040]   controversial topic is probably not the best idea.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.880]   Wait until you are truly free.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.960]   But are we ever? There's always two sides to every conflict. Of course, everybody is going to be pro-freedom.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.920]   But to think the Chinese people are tyrants and don't want freedom and prosperity themselves would be naive.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.520]   Please differentiate between a country's citizens and its government.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.400]   Just like, look, President Trump is our president and I would say half the nation disagrees with him.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.680]   So you're not going to paint all Americans as Trump supporters, right? You've got to look at people individually,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:28.560]   understand their story, their backgrounds, their beliefs, talk to people individually and hear them out before
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.880]   generalizing and stereotyping people and countries for that matter.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.280]   It is sad that we cannot all get along.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.400]   But it's also naive to think that complete harmony is possible in our messy, messy world. We are imperfect beings.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.040]   We have insecurities. We have frustrations, worries, desires and hopes for our children and for ourselves.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.280]   These feelings manifest themselves in good and sometimes very, very bad ways.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.960]   Things stay bad for a very long time because we do not have the courage to stand up for ourselves.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.440]   We stay at jobs we hate because we depend on the income and the health insurance,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.760]   which has now gotten to absurd, absurd levels.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:15.240]   We hide in herds because we're too afraid to stand up for ourselves or voice our true opinions. As a result,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.600]   we create echo chambers. And when this happens,
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:25.280]   I'm always reminded by a quote by Martin Niemöller, who was a German Protestant who spent seven years in Nazi
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.680]   concentration camps for opposing the religious policies of Hitler. He said,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.960]   "First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.640]   Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me."
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:00.400]   The only way we can stop bad things from continuing to happen for so long is to take a stand,
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.600]   to have the courage to stand up and say something.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.400]   My hope is that all of you take a stand, have a heart-to-heart with your
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.120]   transgressor and forgive if they've truly apologized for their actions.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:21.920]   By taking a stand, you are helping to break the cycle. At some point, you will realize you're no longer doing it for yourself,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.320]   but for your children's future.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.360]   Here are some thoughts on how you gain the courage to speak up.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.480]   One, the first is getting your finances in order to eventually achieve financial independence.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.520]   Once you're no longer beholden to money, you can speak more freely. Trust me on this.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.560]   Two, listen to both sides of a conflict and understand what is going on.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.200]   Don't just throw out zingers there and say this or that without fully
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.240]   understanding why there's a conflict because there's always two sides to a conflict.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:04.800]   Three, present your opinion after thorough research on the matter in a civil manner to maximize the potential for the other side to listen.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   I don't think we're listening enough. The more we can listen, the more we'll understand and the more we can create some harmony.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.000]   This way, if you are civil in your delivery, you're also going to be able to minimize any
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.680]   backlash that you're going to receive and you will get backlash. Trust me on that too.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.400]   And then finally, there's a great book that I just read.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.880]   It's called The Courage to be Disliked. It's an international bestseller. It's by the authors Ichiro Kishimi and
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.520]   Fumitake Koga.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.160]   It's a great easy read. It's about a young person talking to a philosopher and
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:45.800]   the young person has some problems in his life and he's trying to overcome them and the philosopher teaches him how to overcome
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   these hurdles and achieve his dreams.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.720]   So those are my tips. Keep fighting on and if you enjoyed this podcast,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   please subscribe and share and I'll see you guys around in the comments and the message boards. Take care.
