[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.400]   So how do you sort out an apostle from everybody else?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.280]   You have somebody teaching over here and somebody teaching over here.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.240]   How do you know who's true?
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.760]   Well, the one who does miracles gives evidence of speaking the Word of God
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.960]   because he's being validated by the power of God.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.360]   As in the case of Christ, we're to validate his claim to be God,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.800]   and the miracles done by the apostles were to validate their claim to be the messengers of God who spoke on his behalf.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.760]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.400]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:01:08.840]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.560]   Go to 1 Peter, if you will, and I'm going to read my text.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.440]   You ready for this?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   That's what I was assigned.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:32.880]   I know the name means much to you already, and you know much about him,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.680]   but we want to examine his life in relation to this incredible letter.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.480]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.580]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.600]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.620]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.620]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.620]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.620]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.620]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.400]   It was July 19, 64 A.D., and Rome burned, famously while Nero fought. While Nero fiddled.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.760]   The great city of the ancient world was consumed in a holocaust of fire.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.860]   And Rome was a city of high wooden tenements and very narrow streets.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.080]   The fire spread fast for three days and three nights,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   and was put out here and there, and broke out again and again,
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.980]   and each time it was even worse.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.740]   The Romans actually believed Nero was responsible for bringing down their glorious city and their homes,
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.360]   because Nero loved to build.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.580]   And so he seemed to want to destroy what he thought was inferior,
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.500]   so he could be famous for rebuilding it.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.060]   So he sat and watched the raging inferno from the Tower of Messinus,
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.340]   and said he was actually charmed by the loveliness of the flood.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.240]   And so he sat and watched the raging inferno from the Tower of Messinus, and said he was actually charmed by the loveliness of the flood.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.280]   And so he sat and watched the raging inferno from the Tower of Messinus,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   and said he was actually charmed by the loveliness of the flood.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   People who tried to put out the flames eventually were hindered and new fires were started.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.160]   People who tried to put out the flames eventually were hindered and new fires were started.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.120]   Obviously the people of Rome were devastated.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.580]   The Temple of Luna, the Ara Maxima, the Great Altar, the Temple of Jupiter, Stator, the Shrine of Vesta, the very household gods.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.540]   The Temple of Luna, the Ara Maxima, the Great Altar, the Temple of Jupiter, Stator, the Shrine of Vesta, the very household gods.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.120]   Everything was burned, and the people who were left were homeless.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.660]   Everything was burned, and the people who were left were homeless.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.260]   The resentment of Nero was bitter and possibly deadly.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.380]   The resentment of Nero was bitter and possibly deadly.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.880]   Nero needed to redirect suspicion away from himself because he had admitted nothing.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.820]   So he found a scapegoat, and the scapegoat were the Christians.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.480]   It was a rather ingenious choice because Christians were already the victims of hatred and the
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.880]   victims of hatred and slander in the city of Rome.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.600]   They were connected in the minds of Gentiles with Jews, and already anti-Semitism had a
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.680]   place in that culture.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.820]   The Lord's Supper, they heard about, was closed to them, to pagans.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.880]   And since they didn't know what was going on, but they heard about eating and drinking
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.840]   the flesh of Christ, they assumed that this was some kind of cannibalism.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:16.880]   And the Christians were cannibals who ate babies and even Gentiles.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.740]   The familiar Christian embrace called the kiss of love used at the love feast was a
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.820]   source of accusations about orgies.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.100]   Christians were also very unpopular because they split families.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.100]   Jesus had said that, right?
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.240]   "Unless you hate your father, your mother, your brother, and your sister, you can't be
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.480]   my disciple."
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.800]   Christians also spoke of a day when the world would dissolve in flames.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.920]   And Peter even writes about that, so they could easily be blamed for the fire.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.180]   As a result of this deflection away from Nero and making the Christians appear to be guilty
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.280]   of this massive holocaust, savage persecution broke out against Christians.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   I'm not going to go into all the details.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.300]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.360]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.400]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.460]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.480]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.540]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.580]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.600]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.640]   I'm just going to go through the details.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.240]   against Christians.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.020]   Tacitus, the Roman historian, reported that Nero joined in on the persecution.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.300]   He rolled Christians in pitch, and then set fire to them while they were still alive,
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.980]   and used them as living torches to light his garden parties.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.520]   He sewed them up in the skins of wild animals and set hunting dogs on them to tear them
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.860]   to shreds.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.980]   And they were crucified.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:43.920]   Christians perished in a sort of a delirium of savagery, and even lynching became common
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.020]   in Rome.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.140]   Within a few years, Christians were imprisoned, racked, seared, broiled, burned, scourged,
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.720]   stoned, and hanged.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.500]   Some were lacerated with red-hot iron; some were thrown on the horns of wild bulls.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:13.060]   This letter was written just after that persecution began, at a time when Christians were suffering
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.660]   severe persecution.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:24.060]   And if you look at 1 Peter with me, just go through it and capture it in a few verses.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.660]   Chapter 1, verse 6: "In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.620]   you have been distressed by various things."
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620]   1 Peter 1:6: "In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620]   you have been distressed by various things."
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.700]   Chapter 2, verse 21: "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.340]   for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, who committed no sin,
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.160]   nor was any deceit found in His mouth.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.140]   And while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:59.020]   threats but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously."
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.740]   Chapter 3, verse 13: "Who is there to judge?
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.740]   Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.100]   But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.040]   And do not fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled, but sanctify Christ as Lord
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.500]   in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.440]   an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.840]   Keep a good conscience, so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.740]   your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.340]   For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right than
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.200]   for doing what is wrong."
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.300]   And even in chapter 4, verse 12, we read again: "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.460]   ordeal among you which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.740]   were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.740]   rejoicing.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.580]   So that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exaltation.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.060]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.800]   and of God rests on you."
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.400]   And then at the end of the chapter, verse 19: "Therefore those also who suffer according
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.900]   to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator, doing what is right."
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.740]   And that beautiful promise down in chapter 5, verse 10.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:34.080]   "After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:44.180]   eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you."
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:52.540]   So this letter is full of comments from the apostle Peter on the suffering that is happening
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.740]   to these believers under Nero and the power of Rome.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:03.100]   The emphasis, you might say, of this epistle is to teach believers how to live victoriously
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.980]   in the midst of persecution, how to live without losing heart, without wavering in faith, without
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:21.800]   becoming bitter, without hating the persecutors, realizing that we have a hope, and that hope
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.740]   is ours because of the promises of God in Christ.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:35.660]   And we have an inheritance waiting for us, undefiled, unfading, unscarred, laid up for
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.760]   us in heaven.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   So we live in hope.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.620]   As I read you those various verses which speak of suffering, I want to go back and go through
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.720]   it again and look what's connected to suffering.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.280]   Chapter 1, verse 7, the next verse: "So that the proof of your faith, being more precious
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.740]   than gold, which is perishable, may be found in the presence of God."
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:01.420]   "Many a person, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.800]   and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.600]   Or verse 13: "Prepare your minds for action, keep sober in your spirit, fix your hope completely
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.060]   on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.340]   Or again in chapter 2 and verse 12: "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.740]   so that in the thing in which they are, they will be the first to be brought to you."
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.400]   Or verse 13: "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.000]   which they are, they will be the first to be brought to you."
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they are, they
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.500]   will be the first to be brought to you."
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.000]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they are, they
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.500]   will be the first to be brought to you."
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.000]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they are, they
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.240]   will be the first to be brought to you."
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.740]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they are, they
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:33.740]   may, because of your good works as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation."
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:40.980]   Over in chapter 4, verse 13: "To the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:48.360]   on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exaltation."
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.800]   Chapter 5, verse 1: "Therefore I exhort the elders among you as your fellow elder and
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:00.300]   witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed."
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:11.280]   And verse 4: "When the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.460]   Now the apostle Peter doesn't promise them anything better in this life, but he promises
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:21.640]   them something infinitely better in the life to come, doesn't he?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:29.040]   But there's another life to come, and that is the life to which those in persecuted situations
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   must always go.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   Verse 4: "And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   Now the apostle Peter doesn't promise them anything better in this life, but he promises
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   them something infinitely better in the life to come, doesn't he?
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   But there's another life to come, and that is the life to which those in persecuted situations
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.140]   must always go.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.160]   And verse 5: "Therefore I exhort the elders among you as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.760]   to come, to be with you in these times of suffering, to be with you in these times of
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:30.800]   suffering, to be with you in these times of suffering.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:30.840]   And verse 6: "When the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:38.500]   That's one of the benefits of persecution, heavenly reward and heavenly preoccupation.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:46.600]   So that's the character of this book, being able to keep your focus on the glory to come
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:56.140]   in the midst of suffering that is more than normal, more than your human strength could
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.920]   bear.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.000]   Now with that in mind, the Lord chooses people.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.760]   He chooses Peter to write this letter.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.580]   Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.420]   Now let me see if I can just do a quick little biography on Peter, just to put the pieces
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.000]   together that we all are familiar with.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.940]   There were twelve apostles, and they're named four times in the New Testament: Matthew 10,
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.620]   Mark 3, Luke 6, and Acts 1.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.440]   And every time you have a list of the twelve apostles, the first name is always Peter;
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.380]   the last name is always Judas, for obvious reasons.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.840]   But the first name is always Peter.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.620]   He was the leader of the twelve, and the group of twelve is divided into three segments,
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.780]   or four segments: three, three, three, three.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.980]   The first three: Peter, James, and John, the most intimate with our Lord.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.560]   But among those most intimately acquainted with our Lord in that inner circle who, for
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:55.480]   example, were taken to the transfiguration, Peter is the one who is the dominant figure.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.680]   These men were specifically called by Christ.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:08.520]   In John 15, Jesus says, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you."
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.720]   He chose them.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.800]   They were chosen for the purpose of being trained to go and preach the gospel.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.240]   They were to be the eyewitnesses of the resurrection, and out of that eyewitness account, knowing
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.800]   Christ, knowing Him through His death and resurrection, they were to go and be the first
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.520]   wave of preachers of the gospel.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:38.800]   They also were the key authors of New Testament revelation, they and those associated with
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.300]   them.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.920]   In Ephesians 2:20, we're told they're the foundation of the church.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.880]   The church is built on the cornerstone of Jesus Christ, but the apostles are the foundation.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.920]   They received direct revelation from God.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.360]   In Ephesians 3:5, we read that God has revealed His truth to His disciples.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   He revealed His truth to His holy apostles in the Spirit.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.120]   They were the recipients of revelation.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.680]   Jesus even said to them, "When I'm gone, the Holy Spirit will come, and He will lead you
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.660]   into all truth, and He will tell you things about Me."
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.420]   They were the source then of teaching divine truth, and that is why when the church was
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:26.340]   founded on the day of Pentecost, according to Acts 2:42, they were regularly, daily engaged
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.200]   in studying the apostles' doctrine.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.320]   It was divine doctrine coming through the instrumentation of the apostles.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.780]   So they were gospel preachers chosen by the Lord.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.980]   They were the foundation of the church.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.840]   They were the recipients of revelation.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.260]   They were the teachers of that first generation.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.680]   They taught revealed truth.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.660]   They repeated revealed truth again and again.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.920]   Not every time when they spoke did they give new revelation.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.280]   They received revelation, which they repeated often.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.040]   They were examples of revelation.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.520]   The life that the Lord wanted them to live as a pattern for all to follow.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.920]   That is why they are called holy apostles.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.760]   I just read that to you, holy apostles, Ephesians 3:5.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.800]   God gave them a special talent, special supernatural gift to do signs and wonders and miracles,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.200]   according to 2 Corinthians, chapter 12.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.880]   These are called the signs of an apostle.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.820]   How do you sort out an apostle from everybody else?
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.280]   If you have somebody teaching over here and somebody teaching over here, how do you know
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.280]   who's true?
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.980]   Well, the one who does miracles gives evidence of speaking the Word of God because he's being
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.560]   validated by the power of God.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.080]   So the miracles, as in the case of Christ, were to validate his claim to be God, and
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.520]   the miracles done by the apostles were to validate their claim to be the messengers
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.040]   of God who spoke on His behalf.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.720]   They will be eternal.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.080]   They will be eternally honored.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:07.040]   We read in Revelation 21:14 that heavenly city called the New Jerusalem has twelve foundation
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.340]   stones and each of them is named for an apostle.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.300]   Obviously one of them is not Judas, so whether it's Matthias who was selected to take the
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.220]   place of Judas or the apostle Paul, we'll have to wait to see.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.940]   We haven't had word from heaven as to who gets that honor.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.560]   Now Peter is the dominant man.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.520]   He's the dominant figure among the apostles.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   In fact, the four gospels are full of Peter.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.480]   If you know anything about any apostle, you certainly know most about Peter.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:45.820]   After the name of our Lord, no name is mentioned more frequently in the four gospels than the
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.540]   name of Peter.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:55.120]   Our Lord speaks often to Peter, more often than to any other of the disciples, sometimes
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.400]   in praise, sometimes not so much.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.400]   Sometimes in blame.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:08.320]   No disciple was so pointedly reproved by our Lord, rebuked by our Lord as Peter, and no
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.580]   disciple ever ventured to reprove his master but Peter.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.920]   No disciple ever so boldly confessed.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.400]   No disciple ever so outspokenly acknowledged and encouraged our Lord as Peter repeatedly
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.780]   did.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.240]   No one ever intruded and interfered and tempted him as repeatedly.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.

[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   No disciple ever said anything to Peter.
