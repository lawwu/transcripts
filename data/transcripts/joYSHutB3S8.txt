[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Is there anything happening right now
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.100]   that you know about 'cause you're in the industry
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.380]   that maybe other people will hear about
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.180]   over the next few years, but would be good to know now?
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.140]   - Well, let's go through some of the scams that exist
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.940]   and sort of match them to what's going on.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.740]   First of all, there are healthcare scams
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.940]   that have been going on for forever,
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.780]   but in particular, COVID was a petri dish for them
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.420]   and now monkey pox is becoming a problem as well.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.820]   And that could be anything from updates,
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.460]   to tracking, to notifications,
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.140]   to here's where you get your vaccine,
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.420]   here's where you schedule your test, these kinds of things.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.080]   So you have to be on the lookout for this.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.460]   Again, as you said, run your cursor over the email address
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.620]   to make sure that where it's coming from looks legitimate.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.260]   And even then, wherever it's coming from,
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.100]   even if it's a phone calls from someone saying
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.180]   they're from the health department,
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.060]   thank them, hang up, independently confirm
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.380]   the right number for your county health department
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.740]   or your state health department, or even the CDC,
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.380]   if you think you're getting a call from the CDC,
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.520]   which I really haven't heard of too many calls
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.220]   coming from the CDC.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.640]   But, and then call the real number and speak to somebody
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.400]   and confirm whatever that information
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.120]   that they're providing you.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.760]   And remember, in most of these cases,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   they are never supposed to ask you
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.440]   what your social security number is
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.280]   or getting credit card information from you.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.760]   You know, you can't pay to get to the head of the line
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.740]   with these.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.360]   If it's a legitimate government situation
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.960]   and it's involving healthcare,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.760]   there is a protocol to use.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.960]   And in no protocol that I know of and have ever known of,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   are you paying something in advance
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.960]   in order to advance your prospects with that?
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.840]   So you have health, job scams all the time,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.100]   especially during the great resignation
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.860]   and now with inflation and now with the concerns
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.500]   about whether or not there's going to be a recession.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.020]   You know, people may be looking for additional jobs.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.060]   There, go to legitimate, well-vetted websites
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.940]   and make sure that you're communicating
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.620]   with the right organization.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.740]   If someone asks you to provide your social security number
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.980]   right off the bat, that's not legitimate.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.740]   Don't walk, run.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.460]   - So this could be a job board.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.500]   You see a job you're interested in.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.220]   You're like, ooh, this company's interesting.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.820]   Maybe I should apply for it.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.580]   It could just be a totally a fake company
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.260]   that's leading you down a path of interviewing for a job
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.820]   with the purpose of just collecting information about you.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.660]   Is that-
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.500]   - Absolutely.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.180]   Or getting financial information by way of, you know,
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.500]   giving you, giving them your credit card information.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.860]   Let's say it's a secret shopper job and they say, well,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.620]   you know, to get you started, you know,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.860]   we're going to be laying out some money,
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.180]   but we'd like you to sort of reimburse us for this.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.020]   So be careful.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.580]   You don't want to get involved in anything like that
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.980]   unless you can confirm the legitimacy of it.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.940]   So always independently confirm.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.420]   Also confirm that that particular company
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.060]   is actually looking to hire people,
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.620]   which you can go by going to the real website
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.900]   of the organization and then calling the HR department
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.700]   of the company and asking them
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.460]   if they're conducting interviews.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.860]   But you have to be very careful about job scams.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.420]   There was a scam that was going around for a while,
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.140]   disappeared, came back again, the jury commission scam.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.580]   That's where you get a phone call.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.460]   Someone represents themselves to be
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.140]   from the jury commission.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.780]   They're polling, quote, eligible jurors in the district.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.780]   And if you would be so kind as to provide them
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.940]   with your social security number,
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.820]   they'll be able to let you know whether or not
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.780]   you're eligible or not for the jury poll.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.980]   There have been scams where police departments
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.580]   were supposedly calling people
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.580]   and asking them for specific information.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.860]   Generally, police departments just don't call people
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.620]   out of the blue, or if they do, it's a legitimate detective.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.420]   They may be asking you questions,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.540]   but they're not going to be asking
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.100]   for your social security number or your date of birth
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.740]   or things like that.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.540]   So unemployment scams, of course,
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.700]   have been a disaster during COVID.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.900]   I mean, billions upon billions of dollars have been stolen.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.260]   My own sister-in-law, who was on one of our episodes,
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.260]   was talking about the fact that she was legitimately notified
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.380]   by her home state of Colorado and by the state of Ohio
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.380]   that somebody using her information
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.820]   had applied for unemployment benefits.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.340]   In one case, she found out simply because she received
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.740]   a debit card in the mail from the unemployment agency,
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.980]   which she said, "I'm not looking for a job.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.180]   I'm fine. I'm not out of work."
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180]   We've had cases where people found out
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.180]   because someone in their company walked up to their desk
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.820]   in the days when people were actually at their desk
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.820]   and said, "By the way, why did you apply for unemployment?
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.540]   You still have a job here."
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.420]   So, you know, that was going on.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.780]   You have the tech scams.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.140]   That's when you get a phone call
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.900]   from someone representing themselves
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.900]   to be from Apple or Microsoft saying that they've noticed
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.140]   that there's a problem with your computer.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.460]   They are going to direct you to a site
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.140]   where you can download certain software,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.620]   which will enable them to then come into your computer
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.620]   and check it out and solve whatever the problem is.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.860]   Apple and Microsoft, they don't do that,
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.780]   but scammers certainly do that.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.700]   So, you know, be on the lookout for tech scams.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.540]   Then, of course, in the line of work
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.940]   that you've been talking about too,
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.700]   which is vacations and points and all of that,
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.300]   there have been theft of frequent fire miles.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.900]   There have been all kinds of vacation scams,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.500]   all kinds of rental scams
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.420]   that people have to be on the lookout for,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.500]   which we can go into further depth if you'd like to do that.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.940]   And then there's catfishing, which is huge.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.180]   And it just, you know, whatever the theme may be,
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.180]   it's still a catfish.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.460]   And what people are trying to do
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.500]   is they're trying to tug on your heartstrings
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.900]   and get you to believe that they care about you.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.060]   And the whole goal is to get into your life
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.740]   as quickly as possible and as authentically as possible,
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.180]   but yet you never really get to see them.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.580]   You never get to really hear them.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.820]   You may just be communicating with them by text or by email.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.380]   And then at some point relatively quickly
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.340]   into this relationship,
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.860]   you're suddenly asked for a lot of personal information,
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.900]   or they send you a compromising picture
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.660]   and ask you to reciprocate.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.260]   And what you don't realize, that's not their picture,
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.940]   but unfortunately that's your picture
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.780]   you just sent to them.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.460]   And suddenly you can become a victim
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.460]   of extortion and blackmail.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.020]   Or they ask you to provide credit card information
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.220]   so that you can help them get a plane ticket
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.700]   to come visit you.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.060]   Or we've had cases, we had a woman on our show
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.980]   talking about the fact that she met someone online
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.700]   who even had a terrific LinkedIn profile
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.660]   as a very successful medical professional
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.020]   who had decided to dedicate part of his life
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.980]   to go to the Mideast and then open a clinic there.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.940]   And somewhere in the first couple of weeks
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.420]   that they were getting to know each other,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.180]   he said, you know, our equipment has come in.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.900]   It's held up by customs at the airport.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.660]   If there's any way that you could help me
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.860]   by sending me 30,000 so I can get the equipment out,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.700]   that would be great.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.660]   Of course, she didn't do it.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.700]   She wouldn't fall for it.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.260]   But unfortunately, a lot of people do.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.180]   I mean, we've seen cases where someone was taken
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.180]   to the tune of $2 million by someone who convinced them
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.860]   that he loved him.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.980]   And the only way that they found out
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.500]   there was something wrong,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.420]   which they should have known from the beginning,
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.700]   but was that a financial advisor notified members
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.820]   of their family and said,
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.740]   "Something's going on with your mom.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.620]   She's taking a lot of money out and sending it overseas.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.380]   You really need to look into this."
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   And even after confronted with the reality of her situation,
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.700]   she said, "Okay, I understand it's a fraud,
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.300]   but in my heart, I still love him."
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.580]   I mean, this is how deeply they ingrain themselves
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.820]   into your life.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.100]   And then another scam, and I won't go on forever,
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.500]   but another scam are charity scams.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.580]   And this is where they'll take the issue of the day,
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.260]   whether it's the Ukraine, it's a natural disaster,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.060]   it's a crisis somewhere in the world, it's children,
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.300]   any one of those topics, whatever is in the news,
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.700]   they will use it, they will convince you
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.620]   that they are the newest, best, most successful,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.020]   most respected organization in the space.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.700]   And could you please give them credit card information
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.180]   or send money to this?
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.820]   And it's not real, it's a fraud.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.660]   That's really interesting.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.900]   So I've been a little familiar with some,
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.380]   not all the others.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.980]   When it comes to the frequent flyer miles thing,
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.140]   if you Google my name, there's some articles
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.660]   about having a lot of points and miles.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.260]   And so I have been a victim of, I guess,
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.500]   theft of points, I guess,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.020]   which we talked about maybe coming on your show.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.540]   And if that happens, definitely go check it out.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.500]   I'll tell the full story. - Absolutely.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.580]   - But in short, it led me to,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.900]   that's what set me down a path
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.780]   of really locking down all these accounts,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.700]   because someone was able to call Chase
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.860]   and get Chase to let them order things
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.740]   with points on the internet.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.660]   The craziest thing,
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.460]   and I have still today don't understand it,
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.140]   was they ordered an Apple laptop using my points,
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.860]   but they shipped it to my house.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.540]   Now, maybe the plan was to come to my house
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.180]   and kind of pick it up, but they never did.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.820]   And I just, an Apple laptop showed up.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.300]   So it was like the strangest fraud
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.580]   because Chase refunded the points.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.420]   And now I had a laptop.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.860]   I asked Chase what they wanted me to do with it.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.220]   And they said, "Try to take it to the Apple store."
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.580]   The Apple store didn't want it.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.460]   So eventually Chase said,
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.940]   "The best thing we can tell you is to keep it or donate it.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.580]   We don't know what to do."
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.900]   Which ended up being a happy story for me,
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.860]   but it was probably payback
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.180]   for the hours of time to mitigate it.
