[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   As we resume these studies in the Epistle to the Romans, I am sure that most of you
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.720]   will remember that at the end of the last session we had arrived at verse 23. So we
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:23.200]   resume this evening with a consideration of verses 24 and 25. Verses 24 and 25 in the
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.400]   eighth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans. For we are saved by hope, but hope
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.160]   that is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.120]   that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. For the sake of those who are
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.320]   interested in records and statistics and figures, we are considering the message of this Epistle
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.800]   to the Romans tonight for the 178th time. And here I say we are looking at verses 24
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.600]   and 25. But obviously those who know this Epistle and who know the method of the Apostle
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.520]   will realize very clearly that there is no hope of understanding the message of these
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:19.640]   two verses unless we have some idea as to what the Apostle is doing in this whole section.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.720]   Which leads me to remind you once more of what exactly he is doing in this eighth chapter.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.360]   There is only one great message in this chapter and the message is assurance or certainty
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.840]   of salvation. His object is to show that the salvation which these people as Christians
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.200]   were enjoying, the salvation which any Christian enjoys, is something that is absolutely certain
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.640]   that it is going to be completed. And he brings forward various arguments in order to prove
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.960]   that and to demonstrate that to them. Now those who have been here throughout the years
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.560]   will remember that I hold the view very strongly that the Apostle rarely starts on this great
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.520]   theme at the beginning of chapter 5. That is where he really begins with this whole
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.400]   question of assurance and of certainty where he says, "Therefore, being justified by faith,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.120]   we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.440]   into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." Now there
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.600]   it is. That is the ultimate, you see, the glory of God. And his point is that the moment
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.760]   we are justified by faith, we are in a position to start this rejoicing in the hope of the
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.880]   glory of God. And then he proceeds to give his reasons for this certainty, why he can
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.200]   jump immediately from justification to glorification. And he works it out in chapter 5. Well then
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.240]   he has to digress in chapters 6 and 7 to deal with difficulties, to deal with objections
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.200]   to his teaching and to his doctrine. And having done that, he comes back in chapter 8 once
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.160]   more to his main theme, where again, you see, he takes it up. "There is therefore"—that's
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.640]   it, the same thing as you had at the beginning of chapter 5—"there is therefore now no
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.840]   condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." There can be no condemnation. There never
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   will be any condemnation. In other words, he is back onto his great and central theme
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.000]   of absolute certainty and assurance and finality. And in this chapter, he now marshals all his
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.240]   great evidence to prove this. And we've been looking at the way in which he does it. He
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.120]   has pointed out that we are dead to the law. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.800]   has made us free from the law of sin and death. That's a tremendous thing, as we've seen.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.280]   And it's a part of this certainty. We are no longer in that realm of death. We are in
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.680]   the realm of life. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. And then he goes on,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.400]   as we've been seeing, pointing out to us that the Spirit is in us and that we are in
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.000]   the Spirit now and not in the flesh. And how that leads to certain effects. It's a part
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.440]   of our whole process of sanctification, and it's a guarantee of it. And indeed, he says
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.560]   in that eleventh verse, it's a guarantee also of the very resurrection of the body.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.880]   "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.000]   up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body." You see, there it is.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.280]   Nothing can be more certain than that. "By his Spirit that dwelleth in you." And of course,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.080]   now and again, he turns aside to practical exhortation. That's so in verse twelve. "Therefore,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.640]   brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, but to live after the flesh," and so on. But
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:14.320]   the theme is this absolute certainty and assurance, and what follows of necessity in practice because
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.800]   of that. Well, then in verse fourteen, he comes to another great argument. And that
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   is, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." Now, that's where
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.080]   we began a year ago, to tonight. And it is, of course, one of the most vital doctrines
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.280]   that we can ever grasp. As Christians, we are the sons of God. Not merely forgiven,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.080]   but we are the sons of God. And that carries with it, of course, certain essential arguments
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.560]   in this whole matter of assurance. So, he goes on to point out to us that we've got
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.120]   in our own spirits an assurance which makes us chi-abba father. But over and above that,
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   there is the testimony, the witness of the Spirit with our spirits, that we are the children
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.920]   of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.720]   Now, we spend a great deal of time on those verses, for the reason I've just given, that
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.680]   there is nothing that is so important for the Christian as to know that. That is, in
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.880]   many ways, the height, the highest height of Christian experience, to know, to have
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.360]   the witness of the Spirit with our spirits, that we are the children of God. And it's
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.600]   a tragic thing that there are any Christians who lack that. It's open to all of us, it's
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.320]   possible to all. But if we don't believe in it, of course, we'll never receive it,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.080]   we'll never enjoy it. But if we see the teaching of the Scripture, then we should
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.840]   seek it, and not be content until we are indeed rejoicing in it and all that it has to give
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   us. But then you remember, that immediately raised
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.080]   a problem. And the problem, of course, was this. If all this is true, says someone, well,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:12.560]   then how does it come to pass that such people should suffer at all in this life and in this
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.680]   world? Now, it's a very real problem. People might say, "Oh, it's all very well to be
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.200]   carried away by your own eloquence like that, and to say that we are children, and if children,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.440]   then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ." But there are many Christian people
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.880]   who are suffering, and suffering acutely, having a very hard and a very difficult and
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.800]   a very trying time. Many of these early Christians were cruelly persecuted, found themselves
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.200]   in prisons, and yet here's a word which tells them that they're the children of God and
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.800]   joint heirs with Christ. How can all this be reconciled? Well, you remember, the answer
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.440]   is given by the great apostle. He introduces it in the second half of verse 17, "If so
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:02.840]   be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." And then, you remember,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.680]   he works out the argument in detail from verse 18 to the end of verse 23. And this is the
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.280]   locus classicus, the great passage in the whole of Scripture on suffering in the life
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:23.320]   of a Christian. Nothing greater or more exhaustive than this is to be found anywhere on that
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.640]   particular theme. And you remember how we saw the apostle, in order to make this thing
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:35.960]   clear, has to take us right away back to creation and to the fall of men. He gives us this astounding
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:43.240]   summary of the whole history of the world, and points out how even the brute animal creation,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.880]   and even inanimate creation, is looking forward to this great day that's coming, to the
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.960]   manifestation of the sons of God. The whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:02.320]   together until now, but it's looking forward to this thing, looking forward to this great
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.560]   glory that is coming. And not only, therefore, are God's children looking forward to this,
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.880]   but everything else in creation, apart from those who are unbelievers, are looking forward
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.640]   to this great and glorious day. Well, now then, there is how the apostle has worked
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:29.840]   it out. He has dealt with the difficulty with this objection that almost inevitably arises
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:37.880]   in the mind and in the heart of anybody confronted by his magnificent claim, his sweeping statement
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:45.240]   concerning the Christian as the jointer of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Now then,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.720]   what's he doing now in verse 24 and 25? Well, he's really completing that argument. He's
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.920]   finished with the details of his argument as such, and as is his custom, and we delight,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.840]   do we not, to watch his method? Every man has his method, and this is typical of the
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.360]   great apostle. Having worked it out in detail, he sums it up, states it again, specifically
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.880]   and clearly. For he says, "We are saved by her, for hope that he's seen is not her,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.760]   for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.480]   do we with patience wait for it." It's a summing up, if you like, a reaffirmation,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:34.880]   a setting of the doctrine forth of something which is quite inevitable once we really have
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.800]   a grasp of God's plan and method of salvation. Well, now then, we take this up therefore
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.520]   at this point, but you see how important it is that we do take it in its context. The
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.720]   very first word of verse 24 makes us do so, "for", clearly linking up with what has
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.880]   gone before. The apostle always has an argument, he always reasons a thing through. He doesn't
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.800]   throw at us a number of disjointed statements. He's always working out a theme, and that
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.200]   is why I say it's impossible to understand the parts unless we have some grasp of the
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.080]   whole. And I've been reminding you of what this great whole is.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.320]   Well, now then, why is it important then that we should come back to this? Why is it important
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.880]   that we should look at the message of these two verses? And the answer, I think, is quite
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:38.760]   plain and simple, isn't it? It is essential that we should do so if we are to have a true
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:48.600]   understanding of the nature of the life of the Christian in this present world. And surely
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.520]   this was never more essential and more important than it is at this present time. We are in
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.640]   a world of trouble. We are all involved in this. And there are many who are really perplexed
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.840]   about this. They don't understand it. And they're bewildered in their minds. They
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.200]   don't understand what's happening. You know, people who ask their questions, "Why
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:19.120]   does God allow this? What's happening? If God be God, then why?" That kind of question.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:26.240]   Well, now, I'm saying that there's only one way of understanding all this. You can't
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.520]   understand the world unless you follow this teaching. If you like, we can put it like
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.440]   this. You see, there he's been saying in verse 23, "Not only they," namely the
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:43.280]   animals and inanimate creation, "Not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:52.040]   roots of the Spirit." Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:58.960]   to wit, the redemption of our body. Now, here, I say, is the teaching, and it's vital for
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:07.720]   this reason, which alone enables us to understand why it is true that the Christian groans within
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:16.560]   himself while he is still in this world of time and of sin and of shame. There's nothing,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.080]   therefore, that is more immediately practically relevant to the conditions in which we find
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.840]   ourselves, together with all human beings at this present hour, as just this teaching.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.280]   That is, to me, one of the wonderful things about being a Christian. It is only the Christian
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.600]   who really can understand contemporary history. Nobody else does understand it. But every
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.800]   Christian should understand it. We should not be confused at the present time. We should
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.920]   not be in difficulties as Christians to understand what's happening in the world. If we are
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.360]   in trouble, well, it's because we don't understand this teaching. We've adopted
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.640]   some vague, optimistic, general teaching which the world believes, but we should never have
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.440]   believed it. Indeed, what's happening in the world today is but a confirmation of what
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:14.000]   the apostle teaches us here. Far from being confused, therefore, wondering what's happening,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   you and I should feel that the world today is providing a most perfect proof of the whole
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.880]   teaching of the Bible. And that should lead us to rejoice. We are given an insight and
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.600]   an understanding which nobody else can possibly have, and which nobody else certainly does
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.440]   have. Very well, then, I put it in a second form like this. To understand this teaching
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:45.520]   is really essential to our happiness in the Christian life, and to our enjoyment of this
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:53.000]   life. I must emphasize that again. We are meant to enjoy the Christian life. "Ah,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.560]   but you see, doesn't it say that we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit groan within
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.680]   ourselves?" I know, but that's not incompatible with the rejoicing, because we rejoice in
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.120]   hope of the glory of God. And indeed, as I was trying to show at the end of the last
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:15.360]   session, the more you rejoice in hope of the glory of God, the more you will groan within
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.820]   yourself while you're still left here. Far from being incompatible, they go together.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:27.600]   And one is the measure of the other. It is the man who knows something about that glory,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.520]   who looks on at this life and this world and groans. Even as our Lord himself groaned there
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.480]   at the grave of Lazarus before he raised him. He groaned and he wept. Why? Oh, it wasn't
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.240]   just human sympathy. He was groaning because of sin and the effects of sin which introduced
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.360]   death into this world at all. That's what made him groan. It was the contrast in his
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.800]   mind between God's original creation and what God intended and what man had made of
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.400]   it. That's the cause of his groaning. So the two things go together. And therefore
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:11.000]   I say that if we really are to rejoice in our salvation, if we are to pay heed to this
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.240]   same apostle's exhortation to the Philippians, "Rejoice in the Lord always and again,"
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   I say, rejoice, we realize that that means that we must be rejoicing now, with the world
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:29.440]   as it is at the present time. With whatever may be happening to us, individually and personally,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.360]   we are still to go on rejoicing, rejoicing in the Lord. And we can only do that, I say,
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.760]   as we understand the teaching which we are given here so plainly and so clearly. Very
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:50.080]   well then, let's look at it. Here is his statement. "For," he says, "we are saved by hope."
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.160]   Now what does this mean? Well, what he's saying, of course, primarily is this. It's his way
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.560]   of putting it, he says, "Nobody should be in difficulties about this, rarely. It's quite
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.620]   ridiculous if you are, for after all," that's what it means, "after all, we are saved by
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:12.760]   hope." And then, you see, he goes on to ridicule a Christian who is not rejoicing or who's
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:18.680]   in trouble because of what's happening. He says, "This thing is so obvious, hope that
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why does he yet hope for?" Well, you see his
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:31.600]   argument. He says, "This is something that we should all be realizing. It should be quite
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:41.920]   obvious to us that our very salvation is in these terms. But let's be clear about this,
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.120]   because we must be careful about our translation here. We all ought to realize that we are
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.640]   saved by hope. But let's be clear," I say, "about the translation. It's generally agreed
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   that this authorized isn't as good as it might be at this point. It's this word 'by' that
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:09.520]   is misleading. It's better to translate it like this, 'for we were saved in hope.' It's
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.760]   the past tense there. We are saved, well that's all right, but it's a little bit misleading.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:21.160]   It really means we were saved. Because we were saved, we are saved, I know. But you
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.320]   can say that we are saved and mean that it's a process, that it's still going on. But Paul
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:34.480]   says we were saved. It's something in the past. It's something that's already happened.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:43.240]   He says, "For we were saved, we were saved, but in hope, not by hope." Now, why is it
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:49.480]   important that we should translate it like that? Well, it's for this reason. If you take
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:56.640]   the translation, "we are saved by hope," people might very well run away with the idea
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:05.880]   that hope is the instrument which rarely leads to our salvation. But we know very well, and
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:11.160]   especially those who know this epistle, that the universal teaching of the Bible everywhere
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:19.160]   is that we are saved by faith, not by hope. So it's a misleading translation to say that
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:27.840]   we are saved by hope. We must get rid of the notion that it is hope which saves us. It
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:34.080]   is not the channel or the instrument by means of which we receive salvation. That is the
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.760]   work and the business of faith, and we must always keep that distinction in our minds.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:49.280]   So we therefore say, "In hope were we saved," or "We were saved in hope." But now, that
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:56.680]   doesn't finish it. We've still got to be clear about this. What does this mean, this statement
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:05.480]   that we were saved in hope? Now, you notice that the term hope is used by the apostle
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:12.480]   Chalcaer himself in different senses, and you will find that it is thus used in different
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.440]   senses in other places in the Scripture also. What's meant by hope? Well, hope can mean,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:28.320]   of course, a spiritual grace. Faith, hope, love. There are three spiritual graces. One
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   of the graces is hope. So hope can be a spiritual grace. And it may mean that, indeed, in these
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:43.040]   two verses, it does mean that. Listen to this. "What a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:52.280]   Now, there, hope is a spiritual grace. Then he goes on to say, "But if we hope, for that
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.560]   we see not." There again, it is a spiritual grace. And that is one possible meaning for
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:05.680]   it in its first use here when he says, "We were saved in hope." The question is, does
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:13.120]   it there mean this spiritual grace? Well, let's look at its second meaning. The second
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:21.880]   meaning of the word is not so much the grace that is in us as the thing that is hoped for.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:28.520]   Now, there's the other meaning of the word hope. And there are many, many instances of
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.680]   this in the Scripture. We are told about the hope of the gospel. Indeed, here we've got
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:44.120]   it in our own verse here, in verse 24. He says, "Hope that is seen is not hope."
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:50.320]   Now, that isn't a spiritual grace. You can't see a spiritual grace in that sense. But he
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:57.360]   says here, "Hope that is seen is not hope." Well, there, obviously, it refers to something
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:05.320]   objective. There is the thing that is hoped for, rather than the hoping for the thing.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.760]   But the word hope is used in the Scriptures to cover both the meanings. And therefore,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.280]   we've got to be careful as we are looking at these two verses that we are clear in our
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   minds as to which meaning it has at any given point. Now, the ones I've already adduced
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.680]   are quite clear. "Hope that is seen is not hope." That is the great Christian hope. That
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.400]   is the day of glory that is coming. That is the thing that the whole creation is looking
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.600]   forward to. It's groaning and travailing in pain, looking forward to that. And that's
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.280]   the thing to which we ourselves, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, are also looking
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.840]   forward to. Now, there is the blessed hope, as the Bible calls it. That is the hope of
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:54.040]   our calling. Remember Paul praying for the Ephesians in Ephesians 1.18. He prays that
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.680]   the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened, that they may know what? Well, the first thing
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:06.160]   is the hope of your calling. Now, that means the objective hope. He isn't referring to
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.680]   the grace of hope in themselves, but that he wants them to know what it is exactly that
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:18.520]   God has prepared for them. That is the hope, the blessed hope, the great day that's coming,
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:25.720]   the glory which is coming to us. There it is. Well, now, that's, I say, something which
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:33.760]   is perfectly clear. And in exactly the same way, it is clear that there is this grace,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:40.920]   this spiritual grace, which is called hope. But the question, and that, I say, we've got
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:47.280]   later on. Hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope? There
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.680]   it is. There's your grace. But if we hope the grace again, for that we see not, then
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.800]   do we with patience wait for it. But the question is, what's the meaning of hope in this first
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:06.200]   statement? We are saved in hope. Well, now, you'll find that the commentators argue a
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.080]   lot about this and disagree a good deal with one another, some saying one, some saying
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:17.000]   the other. But it seems to me that we are compelled to say that it's both, and that
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.400]   you cannot make it mean either the grace of hope or else the thing itself for which the
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:32.160]   grace of hope hopes. I feel that it's a term that includes both of them, that neither of
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:40.880]   them is adequate in and of itself. So I suggest that what he's really saying is this. We
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:49.920]   were saved in the sphere of hope, in the realm of hope. Or you could even put it like this,
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:58.960]   we were saved in expectation. Or if you like, we were saved into expectation. Now, I put
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:06.200]   it like that because there it seems to me the two elements are included. And as he's
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:13.440]   talking about our salvation, it seems to me we've got to put it like that. The man who
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.840]   is saved has got this grace within him, but he also is concerned about that objective
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:27.480]   thing. And what he's saying is this. As Christians, that is really our position. We were saved
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:38.440]   in the whole sphere and realm of hope. Very well then, what does that mean? And here there
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.840]   is nothing which is more important than that we should consider what we may call the tenses
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:54.440]   of salvation. Or if you prefer it, the stages in our salvation. Here is where the confusion
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:03.200]   so often comes in. We were saved. Very well, he's looking back. There is the past. Salvation
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.960]   can be divided up into the past, the present, and the future. And it's essential that we
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.840]   should do this, if we are to understand this teaching. Salvation is much bigger than we
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:21.800]   think it is, and we only realize how big it is when we realize that it can be looked upon
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:29.640]   from these three aspects. Look at it in the past, first of all. We were saved. The Christian
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.800]   is a man who has been saved. The Christian is a man who should be able to say, "I am
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   saved." Now, don't run away on a sideline as to how a man should say that and when he
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.280]   says it. I'm not concerned about that at the moment. All I'm saying is that a Christian
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:50.960]   is a man who should be able to say, "I am saved. I was saved." He can look back at something.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:57.280]   What is he looking back at? Well, he's a man who should know that he has been saved already
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:05.560]   from the guilt and from the punishment of sin. There is, therefore, now no condemnation
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:12.520]   to them that are in Christ Jesus. That's finished with. That's happened in the past.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.280]   That's why I've been emphasizing as we've gone along these heiress, which bring out the
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:23.120]   notion of something done in the past and done once and forever. The Christian is a man who
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.600]   should not go on being troubled about the guilt of his sin. He should be clear about
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.680]   that. He should have said, "That's done. 'Tis done, the great transaction's done."
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   Let's go back again to our crucial verse about this room, chapter 6, 6. Knowing this, we
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:49.200]   know this as Christians, that our old man was crucified with him. Now, don't go back
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:57.120]   over that again. We should all be clear that our past has been dealt with. The old man
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.680]   is dead. That means that you're completely forgiven. You are justified by faith. You
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:10.440]   are reconciled to God. Now, that's all looking back to the past. We were saved in this realm
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:18.320]   of hope. I'm putting my emphasis on "we were saved." Right? That means, I say, we've got
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:24.160]   nothing more to do with the law. "Reckon ye yourselves therefore to be dead indeed unto
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:32.200]   sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ." Romans 6, 11. But then don't forget Romans
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:40.040]   7, 4. "Wherefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ,
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.920]   should bring forth fruit unto God." We've finished with all that. Never go back over
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.800]   that again. But now in verse 6 of chapter 7, "We are delivered, we were delivered from
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.640]   the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.600]   and not in the oldness of the letter." I trust we're all clear about that. If you're not
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.320]   clear about that, you can't follow the rest of the argument. The Christian looks back
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.160]   on all that. That's finished. You can't be saved several times, only once. You see, it
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.640]   means that you are crucified with Christ. It means you're all unioned with him. When
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.240]   he died, you died. That's the end of the old men. Don't go back, I say, over this question
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.600]   of your forgiveness. Don't let the devil ever trap you on that. When you fall into sin,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.880]   don't raise the whole question of your justification again. If you do, you just don't understand
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:43.320]   the teaching. That's past. That's finished. There is therefore now no condemnation for
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:52.200]   them that are in Christ Jesus. Very well. We are no longer under the wrath of God. You
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:58.960]   should never feel that, even when you sin. Don't feel you're under the wrath of God.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.520]   The devil will do his utmost to make you feel that. Don't allow him to. What we should feel
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:11.400]   when we sin is not that we are under the wrath of God, but that we've hurt a loving Father.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:17.200]   And what a difference. You go back to him then, don't you? But while you're thinking
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.600]   of his wrath, you don't. You stay away. Like Adam and Eve, you go and hide yourself behind
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:27.400]   the trees in the garden, and you remain miserable. No, no, you're not under the wrath of God.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:35.200]   Even when we sin, we're not back under the wrath of God. That's finished with. No condemnation.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:41.720]   We've wounded and hurt a loving Father. So go back to him, like the prodigal, and you'll
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.880]   find that all is well. Very well, there's all the past. But then look for a moment at
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:54.440]   the present. There is something, of course, absolutely final and finished with. But when
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.200]   you come to the present, this present tense of salvation, you're looking at something
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:08.440]   that is continuing. We are being saved from the power of sin and from the pollution of
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:15.920]   sin. That's the present. We mustn't say that we have been. If you say that you have
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.440]   been delivered from the power of sin, it means that you'll never sin again. It means that
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.840]   you're perfect. And if you say the same about the pollution, it puts you in the same
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.280]   position, and you know perfectly well it isn't true. No, no, this is the present, and this
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:38.520]   is continuous. This is a process, this is increasing. We are being saved from the power
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:46.720]   of sin and from the pollution, the vileness of sin. We are being prepared for that which
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:52.640]   awaits us. That's what's happening to us now. This is the life of the Christian. He
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.920]   is being prepared and does his utmost to prepare himself for that. He that hath this hope in
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:06.440]   him purifies himself, even as he is pure. That goes on. There's your present tense.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.880]   But there is also, as we have to remind ourselves this evening, resuming the subject, the future
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:22.680]   tense. There is all that which awaits us with God. Our final glorification, the glory which
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:29.480]   is coming, when even the body will have been delivered and will be glorified, entirely
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.360]   delivered. The whole of the personality, the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, shall be
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:42.680]   entirely delivered, entirely glorified in every respect. Now that is the thing which
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:50.200]   is coming. That's the future. We are not there yet. So you see, we look in this way
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:58.440]   at the tenses of our salvation. And it's essential we should do so. Here we are. We've
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.600]   received the first host. But let's never forget that we've only received the first
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:12.200]   host. We have received the first fruits, even we ourselves. He says, "but ourselves also
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.440]   which have the first fruits of the Spirit." Even we ourselves grown within ourselves.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:29.000]   Yes, now there's the explanation. What we've had is the first fruits. And there is all
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.040]   this fullness yet to come. Well now, this I say is perhaps, from the standpoint of the
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.680]   enjoyment of the Christian life and the happiness of the Christian, the most important bit of
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.080]   doctrine we can ever grasp. So let me put it like this to you. There are two dangers
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:53.520]   always confronting us as Christians. The first is that we claim too little. And the second
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.480]   is as usual the exact opposite, that we claim too much. And whichever of the two errors
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:05.640]   we fall into, it's bound to lead to trouble and to unhappiness. Now, I say the first danger
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:15.360]   is that we claim too little. By that I mean this. That there are so many Christian people
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:23.160]   who say, "Well, you know, knowing myself as I do, knowing my failure, seeing what's
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:32.640]   happening in the world and my reaction to it, I can't say that I am saved. It would
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:39.200]   be presumptuous for me to say that I am saved." Well, you say, "What is your position then?"
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.960]   "Well," says this man, "my position is that I'm hoping to be saved." And you say,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.600]   "Well, what's your grounds for saying that?" "Well," he says, "the Romans chapter 8,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.680]   verse 24, which says we are saved by hope." Now, this New English Bible, so-called, I
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.040]   mustn't be unfair to it and say that it actually says that, but I think it comes very
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   near to it. It says, "We were saved, though only in hope." Now, there's no "though"
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.680]   in the original. It put it in. I don't know what they mean exactly. It's such an equivocal
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.600]   statement that I don't know what they mean. But reading it superficially, you'd say
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   that it tends to give a certain amount of support to that idea that we mustn't say
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.600]   that we are saved, but we're only hoping to be saved. "Saved, though only in hope."
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:31.440]   No, no, that isn't a true translation. That's interpretation and not translation, and I
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:37.000]   suggest that it is misleading. But there are many Christian people like that, are there
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.840]   not? They say, "I'm only hoping that I'm going to be saved." Now, that is, as I want
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.720]   to assure you, completely to misunderstand the meaning of this term "hope." Now,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.160]   why am I so dogmatic? Well, for this reason. The very past tense that the Apostle uses
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.400]   proves that that is wrong. He says, "We were saved by hope," or "in hope," or
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.880]   "in the realm of hope." It's happening. So it puts that interpretation right out
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:10.200]   immediately and also automatically. It is not a mark of spirituality to say, "Oh,
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.400]   well, of course, I know certain people who say, 'I am saved.' I wouldn't dare say
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.880]   that because I'm aware of my deficiencies." Now, that's not to be spiritual. That's
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.640]   to fail to understand the Scriptures. The Apostle says, "You should know it. You should
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.800]   have absolute certainty and assurance." The whole argument of the chapter, as I say,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.920]   is to give us this absolute certainty and assurance. We are to be crying, "Abba, Father."
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.040]   We are to know the witness of the Spirit with our spirits, that we are, not that we're
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.960]   hoping to be, but that we are the children of God and therefore joint heirs with Christ.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.560]   Now, that's to claim too little. That's to misunderstand the meaning of hope altogether.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.880]   But then you see, on the other hand, there is the danger of claiming too much. What's
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:59.720]   this? Well, this is the problem with the people who say they've got everything now. They
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.100]   claim that they've got a full salvation here and now. They claim it for their spirits.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:11.080]   Some of them even claim it for their bodies. Some claim entire sanctification now, that
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:17.480]   they're entirely delivered from sin, that they're filled with perfect love. Their sanctification,
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.400]   they say, has happened in a second experience and they've got it complete and entire. The
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Apostle doesn't say that. Indeed, he says the exact opposite. But they also claim it,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.240]   some of them, for the body. These are the friends who say that a Christian should never
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   be ill. That sickness, they say, and illness are the result of the fall, but that the atonement
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.560]   is dealt with a fall in every respect. That there's healing in the atonement and you can
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.400]   claim it, and that a Christian therefore must never be ill. They claim it for the body as
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:59.240]   well as for the soul. The Apostle's answer is that we still groan, being burdened, waiting
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:05.940]   for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body. The body is not fully and finally
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:12.280]   redeemed here in this life. And to say that it is, is to claim far too much. That's why
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.000]   the Apostle introduces this whole category of hope. We haven't got there, he says. We
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.160]   are saved in the realm of hope. In the realm of hope. Hope is the thing that he's emphasising
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:29.400]   here. We are in that realm, not in the realm of full achievement of final completion. No.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:35.320]   We are in the realm of hope still. So you see, it is important to get these tenses clear,
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:41.400]   so that we know what we must claim, and so that we know what we mustn't claim. We mustn't
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.360]   abuse the term hope to claim too little. We mustn't abuse it to claim too much. We must
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:53.920]   take it even as it is given in the Scripture, and as we know it to be true, in our own experiences.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.760]   Well very well, and that brings me to my last question. What exactly does this hope represent?
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.920]   What's its meaning here? Well, let me put it in this way, that it doesn't just mean
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:11.640]   that the Christian is a man who wishes certain things, or who desires certain things, or
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.400]   who has longings for certain things. Well, it includes that, but it's much bigger, it's
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:23.520]   much stronger than that. You know, hope, this hope is described in 1 Thessalonians 5, 8,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:30.120]   in this way, 'And for a helmet, the hope of salvation'. It's not just some vague
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.360]   longing or desire, it's something you can put on your head to protect your head against
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.200]   all the wiles of evil, one in the world, in the flesh, and the devil. The helmet, the
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:44.320]   hope of salvation. It's a very strong thing. But not only that, in Hebrews 6, 19 I read
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:50.520]   this, 'Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:57.120]   entereth into that which is within the bag.' Now that's very strong, isn't it? You can't
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:02.640]   talk about vague hopes and longings and desires as an anchor of the soul. But he speaks of
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.080]   hope like that, why? Well, it's a very strong thing. It's something that can hold. It's
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:13.040]   an anchor of the soul. Helmet or anchor. Indeed, we've already seen in chapter 5, verse 5,
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.680]   that he says, 'This hope maketh not ashamed'. Hopes are very strong and a very powerful
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.800]   thing. Well, what is it then? Well, I believe the best way to look at it is this. Look at
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:31.240]   it in its relationships, and especially in its relationship to faith. This is the best
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.400]   way of understanding the meaning of the New Testament term 'hope'. So look at Hebrews
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:45.360]   11, verse 1, 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.'
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:52.400]   Now there is its relationship to faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. And
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:59.240]   then you noticed in the reading at the beginning, 1 Corinthians 13, 13, 'And now abideth faith,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:06.960]   hope, love, these three, and the greatest of these is love.' Now then, here is, I suggest
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:17.920]   to you, the relationship, the way to understand them. Faith is the substance, the substantiating,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:26.520]   the reality of the things hoped for. What does that mean? It means that faith provides
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:36.080]   the ground on which we believe about these things that are coming to us. Faith provides
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:42.920]   the ground, our reasons, the substantiating. There'd be nothing at all if we didn't have
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:51.600]   faith. Faith gives us an assurance that God has done certain things for us once and forever
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:59.880]   in Christ Jesus, and is going to do more. That's why we are saved by faith. Faith gives
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:06.160]   us the grounds, the substance, the substantiating. It therefore represents the reality of it
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:16.240]   all. That's faith. Now hope goes beyond that. That's the way to understand hope. So many
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:23.720]   go wrong at this point. Instinctively, I think we tend to think of hope as something we fall
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:30.440]   back on when our faith becomes weak. I wonder whether you've ever done that. 'Ah,' says
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:36.760]   a man, 'normally I live a life of faith, but sometimes, well, my faith is so shaken,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.200]   I can't say that I'm certain any longer, though, that I believe all I do now is I just
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:49.160]   hope.' In other words, they think of hope as hopefulness. And hopefulness is something
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.960]   which is weaker than faith. Hope is thought of in these terms that it is that which springs
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.480]   eternal in the human breast. Hope springs eternal in the human breast. All right, perhaps
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.680]   it does. I believe it does. I think it's a good psychological statement, but it's got
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:11.280]   nothing whatsoever to do with the term hope as it is used in the Bible from beginning
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:18.160]   to end. Hope is a very strong thing, not something vague and indefinite. 'I'm not saved, I'm
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:26.360]   only hoping. I'm only falling back on this now when my faith is shaken.' No, no. Faith,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:33.560]   I say, is the first thing. Hope is beyond it. Faith leads to hope. What is it then?
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:39.400]   Well, it's like this, if you like. That hymn which we sang just now puts it perfectly.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:47.240]   It is the earnest looking forward. Earnest looking forward. That's what hope does. You
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:53.080]   see, faith gives us a certainty about these things. Hope makes us stand on tiptoe to have
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.520]   a look at them. It's stronger, it takes us a step further. Or, if you like, look at it
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:06.880]   like this. Faith looks back to the finished work of Christ and gives us certainty concerning
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.760]   the things he has purchased for us. That's what faith does. Faith is always looking back
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:18.400]   to the work of our Lord Jesus Christ. That's why, you see, it is this kind of substantiating.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   That's why I believe in anything at all. That's why I believe in these things which are coming.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:31.640]   It's my faith that does that, but it's always looking back to the work of Christ. Hope looks
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:43.560]   forward with eager expectation to the things which Christ has thus purchased for me.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:51.840]   So that hope, you see, takes me a stage higher. It is something which is so certain of these
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:45:00.280]   things that are believed and accepted by faith that it really lives for them, and is always
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:08.640]   looking forward to them. Now, this is real Christianity. This is true Christianity. This
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:20.040]   is the true Christian position. Let me emphasize this as I finish tonight. True Christianity
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:31.440]   is through and through otherworldly. The pseudo-Christianity is always looking at this world. The people
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.000]   who think of Christianity as just pacifism, their Christianity is entirely this-worldly,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.960]   and they're not interested in the other world. The true Christianity has its eye mainly on
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:50.280]   that which is to come. It's otherworldly. True Christianity is not primarily concerned
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:56.840]   now, even with deliverance from hell and punishment, and all the things that trouble us and wear
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:06.400]   us. They rarely belong to the past. The true Christianity sets its affections on things
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:16.360]   which are above, not on things which are on the earth. The true Christianity is that which
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.720]   says while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:30.080]   seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:44.280]   We are saved in hope. Faith brings us into this realm of the things hopeful. I have the
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:49.080]   first fruits of them now, but I haven't the reality yet. I've got a part of it, I've
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:55.680]   got a first installment of it. I've got an earnest of it, but I've got no more now.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   So while I do thank God for what I have and rejoice in it, and I'm certain of this, and
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:05.480]   can look back with absolute assurance to what's been done once and forever, and will never
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:12.920]   be repeated because it doesn't need to be repeated, it nevertheless makes me look all
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:23.400]   the more, and with the more earnest looking forward, to that which is yet to come. So
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:29.800]   you shouldn't be in any trouble about this, says the great apostle. We were saved into
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:37.120]   this kind of position. Don't be disappointed because things go against you. Don't feel
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.640]   that God has let you down. Don't turn and say, "But when I believed the gospel I thought
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.000]   I'd never have another problem, that the story was that all live happy ever after."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.440]   No, you should never have said that, says Paul, because you've been saved in the realm
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:57.480]   of hope. You've been absolutely saved in certain respects. But you know, the greatest
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:04.560]   part of salvation is yet to come. What we've already heard is a very, very small percentage.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:12.720]   It's merely a little farce. So, he says, don't be stumbled by this. Always remember that
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:24.000]   you were saved in hope. And as long as you remember that, you'll be able to say, "Well,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:34.040]   the sufferings of this present hour, I reckon, are not worthy to be compared with the glory
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:44.520]   which shall be revealed in us." And the whole creation shall see it and rejoice in it in
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.040]   that great day. Well, Christian people, hold on to this, and
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:58.520]   especially in these dark and difficult and uncertain days. This isn't our world. I'm
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:08.680]   a stranger here. Heaven is my home. Our citizenship is in heaven, not here. That's the Christian
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   position. That's the Christianity. The world will call that escapism. Let it call it what
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.280]   it likes. That's because of its blindness and darkness. That is Christianity. That is
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:27.080]   the truly Christian position. That was the kind of way in which the apostle himself lived.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:32.800]   In the straight betwixt two, whether to remain behind to help the Philippians or to go on
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:45.840]   to be with Christ, which is far better. We are saved into this realm of hope. Don't
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:53.080]   claim too little. Don't claim too much. But understand your present position as it is
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:50:00.000]   taught us in this great passage. Let us pray.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:09.080]   O Lord our God, we thank thee for thy word once more and for its balance, for its light,
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:16.280]   for its instruction. Lord, open our eyes, deliver us from our prejudices. Grant that
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:23.120]   we may know the true illumination of the Spirit upon thy word, that we may more than ever
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:33.240]   before rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:39.080]   Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:45.800]   and continue with us. Now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour, short, uncertain,
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:56.040]   earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall be safely in the everlasting glory.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.880]   Amen.
