[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.960]   - Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce the only Boglehead
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.560]   who has been to every conference
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.160]   since the first conference, Tim Dempsey.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.800]   He is the champion.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.000]   Welcome to Boglehead's number whatever this is.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.880]   Good to see you, Tim.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.960]   And where's that shirt?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200]   You usually wear a different shirt.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.520]   (laughing)
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.960]   All right, well, welcome everyone.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   Thank you all for coming to our 2022 Boglehead's conference.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.120]   The room is much bigger and a lot more people
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180]   than our last conferences.
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.960]   On behalf of the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.400]   for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.400]   including our conference coordinator, Christine Benz.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   Welcome to Chicago.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.160]   I hope you, if you were here yesterday,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.200]   I hope you enjoyed the Boglehead's University
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.880]   and the reception in the evening
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.800]   and had a pleasant dinner last night.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.360]   There are about 400 people,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.720]   which was our goal for this conference.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.880]   So 400 people in attendance today,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.400]   a much larger crowd than in the past.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.320]   But one thing I forgot to ask yesterday was,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.960]   for how many of you is this your first conference?
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.280]   Oh, quite a few.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.040]   Well, welcome.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.840]   Wonderful.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.040]   Welcome to all of you.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   And each year, we're going to have a conference,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.360]   but in a different location, okay?
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.760]   This year it's Chicago.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.240]   And it depends on the local chapters.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.600]   There's a lot of local chapters out there.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   And what we're asking the local chapters to do
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   is to host an event.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.600]   So it will move around the country, okay?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.240]   And next year, our conference will be,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.800]   you'll find out tomorrow at noontime.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920]   But it's already been decided.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640]   I think you'll be happy with the location.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.040]   So today, everything goes into high gear.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   We are in sessions from nine until nine tonight,
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.240]   if you're going to the banquet.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.320]   I mean, it's a busy, busy day.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.720]   You're gonna hear a lot of people talk.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.760]   So we're gonna start in a couple of minutes
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.480]   with a fireside chat between Bill Bernstein,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360]   Dr. Bill Bernstein, and Jason Zweig,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.440]   which will take place right here.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   And that will be followed by our investment panel,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440]   moderated by Karen D'Amato.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560]   And it'll be Bill Bernstein, Jim Dolly,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.280]   and myself on the investment panel.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.080]   After that panel is over with,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.520]   we're going to break up into the accumulators
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.480]   and the retirees and pre-retirees.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   The pre-retirees and retirees will stay in this room,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   and the accumulators will go out those doors,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.960]   around to a different room, okay?
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   And then we'll have our first session here and over there.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   At the end of the first session of the breakout is lunch.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.040]   So that means the accumulators come back here to eat lunch.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.480]   And then after lunch, the accumulators go back
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.360]   to the other room for, well, they're young.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.400]   They can move faster.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.160]   Come on. (audience laughing)
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.360]   All right, well, as we move along.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.800]   Okay, and then after the second session,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.120]   they come back here for my discussion with Dr. Mel Keel.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.640]   Following that, there is a snack break and book signing.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.760]   If you happen to bring books,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.680]   the authors will be hanging around
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.640]   and signing books if you happen to have them.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.560]   Then we'll have the event with Morningstar.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   Morningstar's Ben Johnson and Alex Lucas following that.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.240]   Then there'll be a break.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   If you're going to go to the Bogleheads Banquet tonight,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   then that starts at 6.30, down in the tent.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.800]   Now, we've had some people donate
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.720]   a couple of banquet tickets.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.400]   So if you are interested in that,
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.080]   if you don't have the financial means to go to that,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.320]   but you wanted to go to it, we have tickets available.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.120]   Just approach us and we'll give you a ticket.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.040]   So thank you for those people who donated tickets to those
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.680]   so that everyone can go to the banquet if they wish.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.120]   The banquet will start at 6.30,
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.080]   and we'll have Mel Lindauer and Taylor Larimore
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.920]   on our video, and then Eric Balchunas,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.200]   sitting in front of me,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.800]   will give his presentation on the Bogle Effect.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.480]   The evening will end somewhere around 9.15 or 9.30.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.560]   Tomorrow morning, back here,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.120]   breakfast begins at seven tomorrow morning,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   and our first speaker, Nick, goes on at eight.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.720]   So it's even earlier tomorrow.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.160]   We'll be done tomorrow at roughly,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   well, not roughly,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.120]   we will be done at exactly 12.15 tomorrow afternoon.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.880]   Okay.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.940]   you
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:43.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
