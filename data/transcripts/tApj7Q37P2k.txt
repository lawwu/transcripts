[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   The following is a conversation with Ben Askren,
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.560]   wrestler, MMA fighter, and a brilliant, opinionated,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.360]   and fun personality in the world of martial arts.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.600]   And yes, he occasionally likes to talk a little trash.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.680]   Given his wild online antics
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.780]   and his boxing match with Jake Paul,
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.920]   some people may forget just how dominant he was
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.920]   in the sport of wrestling and in MMA for most of his career.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.880]   In wrestling, he is a two-time NCAA Division I
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   national champion and four-time finalist.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.540]   In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.480]   with a record of 19 and 0 before losing to Jorge Masvidal
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320]   with the flying knee that caught everyone by surprise.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.400]   He's also into cryptocurrency, disc golf,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.840]   and is the co-host of Flow Wrestling Radio Live.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.140]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.720]   in the description.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.920]   And now, here's my conversation with Ben Askren.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.280]   Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.880]   your MMA career, let me ask you, I have to ask you,
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.580]   what did you think about the Jake Paul
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.340]   versus Tyron Woodley fight?
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.800]   Well, I thought, I mean, I'm obviously unbiased.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.060]   I thought Tyron won.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.280]   I had five rounds of three.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.940]   And again, maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it.
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.820]   I thought he was more effective with the striking
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.560]   and he was more aggressive and Jake had more volume.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.980]   But that was the only thing I would give him.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.100]   And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.140]   They thought he landed more, significantly more punches.
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.780]   I just didn't think he really did any damage.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420]   It was a split decision?
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.180]   Split decision, yeah.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.180]   Were you surprised?
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.220]   Well, it was the thing, so the thing I said
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.580]   when I went in to fight him, I said,
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.820]   we don't really, maybe he's good, maybe he's not.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.800]   We really have no idea to this point, you know?
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.020]   And so I knew Tyron was a lot better at boxing than I was.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.520]   And so I thought, okay, Tyron's,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   I think it's a good likelihood that Tyron beats him up.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.480]   But there's a chance that Jake's kind of good at this.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.800]   And I think that's kind of what played out is
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.640]   he's kind of good at it.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   Even if you saw it the way I saw it,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.960]   he still was impressive in his showing
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.340]   and he's obviously put a lot of time into it.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.920]   So he's not bad.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.480]   We'll say that much, you know?
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.300]   But isn't it surprising to you that like
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.060]   a elite level athlete, combat athlete,
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.020]   lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.340]   but is nevertheless not elite level?
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.380]   But I think boxing's a really specific rule set.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.920]   So I'll speak about Tyron, not myself.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.020]   Tyron had good striking, but obviously
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.500]   it was his first boxing match ever.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.220]   And within mixed martial arts,
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.580]   you have the fear of the takedown
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.460]   and the fear of the kick and fear of other things
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.940]   to go along with the punching.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.580]   And so if you look at Tyron
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.000]   throughout his MMA career, a lot of times
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.300]   what set up his punches were like
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.180]   level change fakes at a takedown.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.540]   They dropped, boom, and then something
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.900]   comes over the top, right?
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.740]   So there's many more elements to worry about
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.580]   in mixed martial arts.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.440]   Whereas boxing, there's only one.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.100]   It was his first fight.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.780]   Yes, I thought Tyron was gonna win.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.700]   I thought this was gonna happen.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.740]   But like I said, I mean, it's pretty evident that Jake's,
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.340]   he's not bad at boxing.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.460]   He's pretty solid, you know?
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.340]   He gets in there and works hard at it, I guess.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.460]   - Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake wins?
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.420]   - Against Tyron?
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.260]   - Against Tyron.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.020]   They fight again and again and again, like iteratively.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.260]   - Yeah, so I mean, part of the thing is,
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.420]   okay, so Jake's corner said you need a knockout
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.580]   going into the eighth round, right?
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.700]   So I think they thought,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.860]   maybe they're trying to motivate him,
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.060]   but I don't see it that way.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.940]   'Cause if they were actually thought that he was winning,
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.900]   why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.700]   when Tyron has clearly has knockout power, right?
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.660]   It's a really stupid coaching philosophy
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.020]   if that's what you're thinking.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.980]   So you obviously are thinking,
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.220]   hey, this is actually in the balance, it's competitive.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.180]   And I feel like Tyron thought maybe he was winning
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.620]   and didn't have the urgency necessary.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.860]   And so I think there's a chance he turns it up a lot.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.100]   Man, I would wanna watch him again before I...
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.660]   - So I have this problem with my personality.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.620]   Here's my personality, Lex.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.100]   I have an issue with not being able
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.580]   to give really exact answers.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.140]   So I hate giving you an answer that like,
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.300]   I don't feel like is 100% calculated.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.780]   So I would like to see them go once more,
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.620]   'cause I would like to see,
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.900]   hey, can Tyron, 'cause if Tyron can turn up the pace
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.260]   and Jake can't handle it,
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.860]   then I think it's an eight, one or nine, two, right?
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.420]   If it goes the exact same way
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.060]   and maybe Tyron wins a close split decision,
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.540]   I'm saying, oh, it's probably gonna be close
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.380]   every single time.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.060]   We're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.940]   So it's like, I feel like out of one match,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.180]   it's not totally indicative
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.540]   of what the future is gonna look like.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.340]   - I feel like Tyron would get a knockout
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.060]   and then you would still be in the same place
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.180]   like not knowing what to predict.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.060]   Okay, so your fight with Jake Paul,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.460]   looking back, you had a little bit of time now.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.100]   How would you analyze that fight?
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.920]   - Well, I mean, the fight specifically,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.780]   I got cracked with an overhand right.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.640]   So I mean, it kind of sucks.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.980]   I would say, you know, and this is where I was like,
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.660]   I really don't care.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.380]   And everyone's like, why would you,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.860]   it turns your reputation.
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.700]   It's like, well, I wanted to do it.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.380]   I had an enjoyable time training it in the buildup.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.740]   Obviously, I wasn't skillful enough to get the win.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.980]   But even despite the fact that I know
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.660]   what's gonna happen, if someone asked me to do it again,
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.820]   I probably would have done it again, you know?
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.660]   And so the way I was thinking about
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.920]   when I was deciding whether to do it or not,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.540]   'cause I got the offer, it's like, okay, is this money,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.180]   it can change my life.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.020]   Yeah, it could, right?
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.340]   It's not gonna double my net worth,
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.900]   but it's gonna add significantly, make my life easier.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.300]   Number two is like, when I was in high school,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.140]   we used to do boxing matches for free
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.180]   just 'cause we thought it was fun.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.060]   We didn't have something going on Friday night.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.420]   Me and my buddies would get together
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.860]   and we had some boxing goals at base
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.740]   and we'd punch each other in the head.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.340]   So it's like, for something I think is enjoyable,
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.260]   not gonna pay me a whole bunch of money.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.340]   Yeah, sure, I'll do it.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.460]   - Would you, do you think if you got the rematch,
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.340]   if you did the rematch, would you,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.660]   what are the odds you win?
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.500]   Okay, let's see.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.340]   - Probably not very good.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.340]   I think he's pretty good, actually.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.700]   And I'm not very good.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.020]   Now it's probably at a low point for me
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.020]   because, so when I started training for that,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.100]   I was like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I've ever been.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.260]   I came off my hip surgery.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.820]   I literally, like when I said, yes, like I'll do it,
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.020]   like I literally started working out like the week before
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.020]   for the first time in my, you know,
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.140]   instance of surgery 'cause I wasn't able to do anything.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.820]   So could I perform better?
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.940]   Yeah, but now after watching him box Tyron,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.660]   like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.180]   Probably not.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.980]   I don't think I can beat Tyron.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.820]   So-- - In boxing.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.540]   - In boxing, yeah.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.260]   So my chances of beating him, you know,
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.220]   and watching that card, it's like, damn,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.100]   like can't it be fun to box someone who I know sucks,
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.940]   who I know can beat?
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.780]   That's what would be fun, you know?
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.940]   'Cause like the training, the preparation was fun,
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.140]   but then obviously I got my butt kicked.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.740]   That sucked, you know?
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.820]   Can I swear on this podcast?
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.660]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.500]   - Okay, well, I was gonna drop an F-bomb,
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.340]   but I wasn't quite sure.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.100]   - I think that sucked is a swear.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.820]   You could drop all of the F-bombs you want.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.460]   So preparation-wise, do you think you were more prepared
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.340]   for that fight or the Jordan Burroughs exhibition?
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.420]   I mean, like how did you approach it mentally, you know?
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.060]   - Well, the Burroughs thing, I obviously,
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.260]   so okay, so when I retired the first time in 2017,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.420]   Burroughs was the only current, like we'll say,
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.140]   really elite level wrestler that I'd never trained with.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.980]   I was really good friends with Nebraska's
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.540]   head of the system coach, still am.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.460]   And I said, "Hey, I'm gonna pay my own way.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.540]   "I wanna come down and train with Jordan
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.080]   "'cause I wanna see what it feels like.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.520]   "You know, I wanna get in there and mix it up.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.000]   "I'm mixing it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.300]   "I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love."
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.460]   And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018,
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.220]   and I spent four days training with Jordan.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.660]   It was a really good time.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.420]   It gave me some great insight into how he thinks
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.100]   and what a great champion he is.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.020]   - What was it like training with him?
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.140]   Can you give some insights?
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.980]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.980]   - Like what the, like how hard is the live training?
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.500]   Is it more drilling?
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.340]   Is it technical?
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.860]   Like how does his, it seems like his style
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.380]   is very different than yours.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.980]   So how does that match up in the room
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.260]   in terms of like what you learn from each other,
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.100]   that kind of thing?
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.740]   - We only went full live for one,
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.540]   I think it was like a 12 or 15 minute go
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.500]   where we would just go wrestle.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.700]   We did a bunch of simulated live.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.940]   But obviously he had, so I was a senior in college
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.340]   and he was a freshman at Nebraska.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.060]   And so we, our teams had dueled each other.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.460]   He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.140]   But he had followed my career.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.900]   And so when I went in there, it was like,
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.300]   "Hey, I know you're really good at this position.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.260]   "What about this position?
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.100]   "What are you trying to do?
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.660]   "How exactly does it work?
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.340]   "And then let's wrestle there."
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.180]   You know?
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.700]   And then, "Hey, what about this position?"
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.500]   And so we would spend 30 to 40 minutes
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.580]   talking about that position.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.940]   - On the ground or?
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.860]   - It was like, one was a chest wrapper,
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.700]   one was a headlock,
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.340]   one was a, I don't know how to really,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.780]   it's called, we call it the lightning dump,
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.900]   but it's a--
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.980]   - The lightning dump?
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.420]   - Yeah, I named, my buddy's name
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.900]   was Lightning Luke Smith in high school
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.300]   and he was the first person I saw do it.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.260]   So usually when I see someone do something,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.940]   then I name that move after them.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.780]   - Got it.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.740]   - I know, right?
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.580]   Great name.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.420]   - It's a good name.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.020]   - Yeah, but so what I said with that is like,
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.540]   he was still trying to be the best in the world.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.020]   I was just trying to go work out with Jordan Burroughs
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.260]   'cause I enjoy wrestling.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.180]   Is like someone who, at that point,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.220]   what he has five world titles at that,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.380]   four or five at that point a lot.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.460]   And so I used it with my high school kids.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.980]   It's like, hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.860]   who's bringing someone in and saying,
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.740]   well, how do I do this?
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.560]   How do I do that?
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.400]   What about this?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.220]   What about that?
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.660]   And so the level of inquisitiveness,
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.380]   that's a hard word, inquisitiveness he has,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.460]   is really impressive.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.660]   And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.180]   because he's figuring out all these little situations.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.820]   And that's honestly one of the biggest things
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.740]   I think wrestlers,
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.900]   a lot of wrestlers fail to do as they get older,
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.740]   even when they get to early college age,
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.140]   they say, this is my style, this is what I do.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.260]   I'm gonna lift and work out hard
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260]   and I'm not gonna add anything to my game.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.580]   Whereas you've seen many progressions
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.420]   in Jordan Burroughs' game,
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.460]   he just made his 10th world team.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.540]   And if you have a really keen eye,
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.220]   you've been able to watch him change.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   I've been watching him since he's done seven.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.180]   He's changed so much
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.620]   and obviously still maintained a world-class level
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.780]   almost the entire time.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.900]   - When you say change, what changed?
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.980]   'Cause he's got that double leg.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.500]   - But he doesn't have that double anymore.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.340]   - What's that?
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.260]   - He hit his double leg for the first time
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.780]   against Alex Deirdre, he hadn't hit it in years.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.860]   Yeah, so that's like,
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.220]   when people think about Jordan Burroughs,
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.260]   they think about the double leg
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   'cause in his early years,
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.380]   fire, he had a great double leg.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.940]   So in those years, I would say
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.540]   the biggest thing with Jordan Burroughs' double leg
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.100]   wasn't his level of explosiveness,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.780]   it was his level of persistence.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.300]   He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.020]   And a lot of times it would be from fun, creative angles
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.380]   and out of scramble, boom, all the sudden he's on you.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.500]   And he was just super persistent with it
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.460]   and I think that was probably the key.
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.700]   And then you saw,
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.500]   when he came out to win the first World Championship
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.140]   in 2011, it was kind of that type of mentality.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.340]   And then shortly after then,
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.940]   obviously everyone was starting to lower their stance,
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.940]   getting lower and he developed a really good
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.420]   Mantis go-behind series
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.340]   where he would go one way, the other way.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.700]   Then he started developing a really good
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.580]   low single ankle pick type thing.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.700]   And then his hand fighting got really tremendous,
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.140]   like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good.
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.940]   And now I just commented at the 21 trials,
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.820]   a few of the defensive sequences he got into,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.740]   it's like, holy shit, just not from an athletic standpoint,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.900]   from a technical standpoint,
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.820]   the things he were doing were just tremendous.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.460]   So I've seen him as someone who's continued
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.660]   to reinvent themselves over the course
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.740]   of the last 10, 12 years.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.540]   - Especially as a junior and senior in college,
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.620]   you're exceptionally dominant.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.540]   If you were to face him at both of your peaks
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.160]   of NCAA wrestling, could you beat him?
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.880]   And if you can beat him, of course you can beat him.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.660]   How do you solve the Jordan Burroughs problem?
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.140]   - Well, so for a folk style wrestling standpoint.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.980]   - Folk style, yes.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.140]   - Folk style, so he had some competitive matches
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.700]   as junior and senior year, he had a 2-1 win over,
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.460]   or maybe it's 3-2 over Michael Chandler,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.820]   who is my teammate who's fighting UFC now.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.700]   He had a 2-1 win over Tyler Caldwell.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.540]   So I think you can glean some insight into that.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.580]   He got so mad about this up on a podcast.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.260]   So during corona, we had to make up all kinds
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.860]   of bullshit to talk about.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.260]   And we were doing like the last 10 years, best 165s.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.980]   And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.700]   He got so mad, he wanted to come on the podcast
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.820]   the next day, so hopefully he doesn't listen to this.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.660]   Fuck you, man.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.900]   But you know.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.820]   - When was this?
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.780]   This is during corona.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.940]   - Corona, last year.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.260]   He got mad, we were talking about--
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.260]   - Before the trials.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.260]   - Yeah, correct, yeah.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260]   So Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus,
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.060]   and that was his junior year, not his senior year,
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.100]   sure, right, but it's close.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.660]   So I think there's some things there.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.020]   I think the interesting thing would be
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.260]   if I would have stuck around, right,
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.180]   so I chose to go into mixed martial arts after 2008,
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.860]   I would have been 74 and he would have been 74,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.780]   so we would have had to wrestle.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.300]   And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.220]   is a lot more difficult to solve
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.060]   than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.540]   And I think he would acknowledge
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.580]   that he's much better at freestyle
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.260]   than he was at folk style.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.180]   Although he was very good, he's better.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.940]   - Does his raw speed, explosiveness,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.300]   present a problem to you?
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.060]   - Well, so he was never,
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.500]   I mean, he didn't really excel on the mat
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.780]   in kind of either style.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.140]   In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions,
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.740]   but in folk style, his entire college career,
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.380]   I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.180]   So he was gaining no value off the top position.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.500]   He was good enough on most people to get off bottom
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.740]   without it being an issue, but it wasn't like,
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.500]   oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.780]   to be careful, there's a lot of things here.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.920]   You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.380]   Whereas in freestyle, I don't wanna say never,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.940]   but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.220]   very, very rare.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.020]   And he does have like lace transitions,
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.100]   so he gets a lot of points there.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.780]   So, and obviously freestyle is,
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.220]   it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.780]   Where we're only doing takedowns, so yeah.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.220]   - Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials,
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.900]   to Kyle Dake?
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.140]   - Oh, Kyle's so, he's so good, right?
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.440]   I mean, I think his performance in the Olympics was,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.660]   was his loss then was shocking to,
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.820]   I mean, we never seen that happen to Kyle Dake.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.020]   You know, he's been a guy who's competed
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.620]   with Jordan Burroughs forever,
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.300]   and obviously he was on the losing side for a while,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.940]   and now he's on the winning side.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.700]   But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip,
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.700]   and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.060]   it's not a coin flip.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.700]   Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake is gonna win
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.220]   that match significantly more times than he isn't,
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.420]   is what it feels like.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.260]   - Yeah, I forgot which trials it was.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.260]   Was it four years ago where Kyle Dake threw him,
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.540]   like he, you saw inklings of like,
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.060]   "Oh, wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard."
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.900]   - Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw,
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.620]   but then he lost one of the matches decisively.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.820]   And then he was hurt in 14,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.260]   and in 16, Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.140]   So in actually in 16, at the trials we had,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.500]   so Jake Herbert was number one seed.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.980]   He was former, as Guy Russell,
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.220]   I was a former world silver medalist.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.700]   So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet,
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.780]   who is now a world champion, Olympic champion.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.420]   You had Kyle Dake in the bracket,
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.020]   who was a two-time world champion now.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.500]   And you had Jaden Cox in the bracket,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.740]   who had not made any teams yet,
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.900]   but is now what, a four-time world medals,
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.020]   two-time world champion.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.460]   So, and then obviously Jaden came out on top of that,
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.660]   won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.020]   So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.440]   And Kyle's contention the whole time,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.380]   and they argued about this.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.300]   So I actually did a little bit of backstabbing.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.420]   Well, it's not backstabbing.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.500]   Both of them or just one of them?
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   I didn't tell any of them.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.980]   Okay, so Jordan got mad.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.420]   So we talked about this fake match during Corona, right?
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.460]   We had to make up something to talk about.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.300]   Yeah, of course.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.420]   'Cause there's obviously no matches.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.420]   So we talked about this fake match and--
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.180]   Do you stand behind that statement, by the way?
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.620]   Listen, here's what I said.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.700]   Kyle Dake's four-time NCAA champion.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.340]   Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.620]   I said, Kyle Dake wins two-one on a minute and six ride time,
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.300]   which I mean, is literally, we're talking as close as it gets,
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.860]   as close as it gets for Kyle Dake,
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.620]   who's a four-time NCAA champion.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.420]   I'm sorry, we're talking--
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.420]   Over Jordan Burroughs.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.500]   Over Jordan Burroughs.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.340]   In a folks style match.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.380]   In a folks style match.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.220]   Hypothetically.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.060]   In college or now?
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:00.880]   Completely hypothetical.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.720]   Now or in college?
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.540]   In college.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.740]   Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.020]   So completely hypothetical.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.580]   And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed at me
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.820]   for picking Kyle Dake.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.740]   He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.940]   So I said, "F that, that's dumb.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.820]   "We need to pick a winner.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.140]   "We need to do something hypothetical."
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.460]   So then I called Kyle Dake and I said,
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.180]   "Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.140]   "in the morning.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.080]   "If he's gonna do that,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.360]   "why don't you come in and argue your case?"
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.700]   So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.500]   So they both show up and they went at it.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.900]   But one of the contentions Kyle had for years,
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.300]   and there's still this rule,
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.880]   if you win a world level medal,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.640]   the following year, you sit out until the very end
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.700]   of the American trials.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.660]   And they do a best two or three.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.900]   So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan,
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.860]   he had to come through a tournament on Saturday,
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.620]   okay, probably three matches.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.860]   And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.220]   in a best two out of three, right?
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.300]   So his contention was,
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.200]   "I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.860]   "'cause I have to compete on Saturday."
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.900]   And then competing on, which it's a fair argument.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.720]   It really is.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.500]   But I also see USA Wrestling's point is like,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.140]   if someone wins a world medal,
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.060]   we're gonna reward them
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.540]   'cause we want that person on the team again.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.220]   - It's crazy though that you're,
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.860]   like Kyle Dake had to wrestle,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.900]   'cause he's not wrestling bums in that division.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.740]   - Not bums, yeah.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.260]   - And then, yeah, I don't know.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.580]   I don't know how wrestlers do it.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.340]   'Cause you have to go to war like three matches
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.060]   and then face Jordan Burroughs.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.600]   - Yeah, especially a few of those years
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.660]   with Dake had the name Andrew Howe,
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.760]   but those were really competitive matches.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.620]   David Taylor had really competitive matches with him.
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.340]   Isaiah Martinez even got in there, Deiringer.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.140]   So he had some really competitive matches
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.720]   before he ever got to Jordan Burroughs.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.920]   So I never answered your initial question was,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.860]   how did I feel?
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.020]   So the Jordan Burroughs match,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.380]   I was not in wrestling shape at all.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.660]   Meaning wrestling's heavily dependent,
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.580]   especially neutral positions,
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.540]   heavily dependent on timing and other things.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.500]   I was wrestling very, very minimally
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.700]   'cause I started fighting again.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.860]   So like my athletic shape was great,
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.140]   but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn't wrestling.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.140]   So I think they were actually trying to do Burroughs-Dake
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.300]   beat the streets.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.800]   It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling every single year.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.640]   - In New York?
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.760]   - In New York City.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.200]   They usually raise like a million dollars.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.480]   They started all these programs in New York City.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.640]   I really wonder what they're doing with the money now
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.080]   'cause they probably can't have the kids wrestling
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.840]   because New York's crazy.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.680]   Anyway.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   - I think New York figures out a way
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.840]   what to do with the money.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.720]   Hence Michael Malice complaining
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.280]   that they're corrupt and all that.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.240]   - But it goes to the Beat the Streets organization
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.640]   who then starts the clubs in New York.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.720]   So I don't know what to do with the money.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.680]   Anyway, so I was called like, I don't know,
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.800]   two weeks before the event and said,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.840]   hey, someone wants to wrestle Jordan Burroughs
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.320]   that fell out, would you wrestle him?
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.720]   I said, yeah, sure, why not?
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.640]   You know, and it's like, listen,
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.520]   I trained with them for four days the year before.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   I had a pretty good idea how the match was gonna go.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.240]   Wasn't gonna go so well for me.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.040]   But it's like, okay, you're missing a main event.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.720]   I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.200]   I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.840]   I can help you guys raise a bunch of money
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.280]   for Beat the Streets.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.000]   My goal is I think I thought I could get one takedown
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.880]   or turn on him was kind of my goal for the match.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.480]   I didn't get there.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.640]   - You went kind of hard.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   - He went hard, yeah, that asshole wouldn't give me a point.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.480]   - Yeah, that--
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.440]   (laughing)
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.720]   - I said, this is bullshit, Jordan.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.680]   I told him during the match, like, this is bullshit.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.480]   You're fucking going too hard right now.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.440]   I'm not a wrestler anymore, I'm a fighter.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.640]   I'm coming in here, so.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.200]   Yeah, so I had a really good idea.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.480]   I mean, we wrestled together.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.400]   I think, and he'll probably get mad,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.520]   'cause I think in the live go,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.960]   we did like the 12 or 15 minutes.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.360]   I think I actually scored a takedown in that, I believe.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.880]   Maybe, or maybe it was a turn.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.560]   He'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.840]   Yeah, so I knew what was gonna happen.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.920]   I knew what the outcome was gonna be.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.760]   I knew I could probably,
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.960]   I was hoping I could stay competitive
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.720]   and maybe lose like 10-2 or something, like, yeah.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.480]   - Well, let's walk back, 'cause I think
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.320]   I originally brought it up in terms of
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.520]   how prepared were you against Jake Paul
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   versus Jordan Burroughs.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.360]   So did you prepare for Jake cardio-wise?
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.840]   - Yeah, I worked hard.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   Yeah, I did.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.400]   But it was, I told you, I started training for my,
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.760]   I mean, once I had my hip surgery,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.040]   they said, you know, for the first six weeks,
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.480]   you can't even walk.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.920]   And it was hard for me to listen to 'em,
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.560]   'cause by week four and a half, five,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.280]   I was feeling pretty good, I wanted to get into my crutches.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.520]   But I'm like, you know what,
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   this is for the rest of my life.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.240]   And if you get the, so if you get the real hip replacement,
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   there's no wrestling, there's no nothing, right?
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.200]   So that's the next step.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.920]   So, okay, I'm gonna take this serious.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.600]   So I do my crutches for six weeks.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.800]   The next six weeks, it's still like really low weight bearing,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.320]   can't do anything, you know?
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.440]   So then I get done with the three months,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.080]   which is like January, and I'm like, okay,
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   I should start working out.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.440]   So I started riding a bike a little bit.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.280]   And then, okay, now I'm fat, I'm fucking fat,
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.160]   I'm gonna get in better shape,
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.040]   'cause I haven't been able to do anything.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.920]   So I'm actually start working out.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.400]   And then that happened, right?
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.360]   So I'm like, okay, well, now I got three months,
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.960]   and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.800]   And I knew I wasn't gonna be a full-time boxer,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.400]   so it's like, okay, how do I put a boxing camp together?
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   So I found, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes,
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.200]   he came up and kind of lived with me-ish kind of thing
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.920]   for three months.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.080]   I found a couple of this guy, K9, out of Michigan.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.520]   He came over three weeks, he was great.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.960]   I went to Freddie Roach for a week.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.840]   So I kind of like, you know,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.000]   tried to get as many good ideas as I could.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.200]   And my thought was like, okay, well, if this dude sucks,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.600]   I can just be tough and block a few punches,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.240]   get him tired, and then beat him up.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.560]   If he's good, there's probably not much I'm gonna do
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.520]   about it in the next three months,
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.200]   'cause I was never good at boxing in the first place.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.880]   All of my stand-up and mixed martial arts
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.440]   was predicated on how do I get through
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.320]   the two or three punches that are gonna come at me
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.360]   in the time I need to get ahold of them.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.940]   You know, you only have to make two or three of them miss,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.820]   and then boom, you're on top of them, at least for me.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.400]   That was all my striking was predicated on.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.560]   It wasn't about, hey, I'm gonna do damage on the feet
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.720]   in order to make something else happen.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.680]   It was like, how do I clear this barrier, get ahold of you?
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.520]   And I actually did the math one time.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.840]   I think I got a takedown,
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.200]   if you include the knockout round against Miles Vidal,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.160]   I got a takedown in every round except two.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.800]   So it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.940]   I got a takedown.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.640]   - Wow. - Somewhere in there.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.400]   - Okay, so you're hunting the takedown once you--
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.680]   - Right away. - Once you get
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.520]   your hands on them, you get the takedown.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.480]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.240]   But the incredible thing about you,
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.520]   I just recently talked,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.960]   spent a couple of days with Jimmy Pedro,
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   and he talked about his guys and just champions in general,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.580]   hating to lose more than they love winning.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.080]   And the way you talked about losing,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.160]   you lost very few times in your career,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   like later, you were dominating both the wrestling and MMA.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.760]   But the way you took these losses against people
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.080]   that are, I don't know, below elite level.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.920]   - It's fair.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.940]   I was gonna get pissy, but it's completely fair.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.160]   I thought he was a bum too.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.400]   - No, that's not what I meant.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.480]   Oh, man, I'm in trouble.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.920]   - It's okay, no, it's good.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.240]   - But what, can you explain the psychology behind that?
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.120]   Is there a system behind this?
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.680]   Is there a philosophy behind this?
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.240]   - Well, so I wasn't very good in the beginning.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.880]   And I think that's where it all starts from.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.040]   So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.480]   I started at five.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.640]   I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.280]   Didn't really get good till 13, and still at 13,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.400]   I'm saying I'm great, I'm getting better, right?
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.920]   I'm pretty good.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.220]   So actually, I have written this book on sports psych,
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.880]   but I got someone to write it for me kind of thing,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.520]   'cause I've had this philosophy for years
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.240]   that there has to be this balance between two things, right?
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.560]   So on the one hand, in this category,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.120]   on the one hand, you have hating to lose.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.080]   A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.000]   But on this other hand,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.920]   you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.840]   'Cause if you don't have that,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.560]   you're never gonna reach your full potential either.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.960]   And so you have to balance these two balls
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.320]   at the same time, right?
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.760]   And so like for me, I always,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.320]   and this is maybe 'cause I wasn't good,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.360]   but I was always like,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.520]   let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.140]   Let me go find, I would like literally,
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.280]   like seventh grade when I was starting to get better,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.000]   it was like, and this is on the internet.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.080]   Well, no one was using the internet.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.200]   It was like a wrestling magazine.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.960]   And be like, "Hey, dad, there's a tournament here.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.240]   I think that, are the kids gonna be there?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.760]   Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?"
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.200]   - You would wrestle like in competition against them?
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.040]   - In competition, yeah, yeah, in competition.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.560]   "Hey, I heard there's this tournament.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.640]   Here's the magazine, it says this tournament.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.040]   Hey, dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?"
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.640]   - You weren't trying to win,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.280]   you were trying to get the experience?
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.840]   - I was trying to wrestle the best guys.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.000]   Maybe I win, maybe I lose.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.700]   There's no, when you do a competition,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.180]   there's no guarantee of a win or a loss.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.780]   You're just doing competition, right?
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.140]   So I wanted to go, I wanted to challenge myself
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.660]   against the best guys,
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.100]   of which I thought maybe I could come out on top, right?
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.660]   So like eighth grade year, I won way, way,
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.900]   you know, I probably lost a handful of times
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.300]   in the state of Wisconsin.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.460]   It was probably really, really minimal
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.940]   the amount of times I lost, you know?
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.540]   But it was just about getting the challenge.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.220]   And it's like some kids, and not kids in my club,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.580]   'cause I'll push them very hard on this,
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.780]   are scared of challenging themselves.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.360]   They like being the big fish in the small pond.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.840]   They're not willing to go say,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.040]   "I wanna go get that guy, and I wanna get that guy,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.140]   and I wanna get that guy."
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.000]   And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.560]   is like, I always just loved the challenge.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.940]   I enjoyed competing thoroughly, right?
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.600]   And I understood from a young age,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.560]   because I wasn't very good, losing's a part of it.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.880]   You're not always gonna win.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.040]   And that was kind of it.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.780]   It's like, hey, sometimes, you know,
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.280]   and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way,
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.200]   but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.600]   And like, that's pretty rare.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.340]   I didn't plan for that to happen.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.660]   That was just what happened.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.840]   - Okay, but you also didn't lose, like,
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.640]   the second part of your college career.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.760]   - My 87, I won my last 87 matches, yeah.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.160]   - So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.000]   You just--
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.600]   - I don't like losing, I still don't like it.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.440]   - Yeah.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.480]   - Yeah, I would have much rather--
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.960]   - Okay, but you don't, you don't seem,
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.200]   you seem to kind of shrug it off a little bit.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.740]   - Okay, so like, specifically with these two instances
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.580]   that you bring up.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.560]   The Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.400]   - All right, let's--
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.240]   - Let's go deep, let's go deep.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.800]   So the Masvidal one, it feels different, 'cause--
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.840]   - So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.240]   Let's, for people who don't know,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.400]   Masvidal loss was your first loss.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.000]   - First loss in MMA, yes.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.840]   - Yeah.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.660]   - Yeah.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.480]   - Yeah, and I mean, it was a dramatic loss.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.320]   - Very dramatic.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   - And there was this kind of buildup
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.080]   as you were potentially one of the greats
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.860]   of all time coming into this fight.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.780]   And so, this pressure, all of that.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.220]   - So, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.220]   I didn't feel the pressure.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.960]   So the Masvidal fight is,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.060]   he got one fucking move on me.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.460]   It's not like he beat me.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.440]   And if we do that again, I think I win.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.580]   At that point in my life, for sure,
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.300]   I think I win way, way, way more times than I lose.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.860]   He knew that too, that's why he didn't want,
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.500]   he didn't want to sign the body agreement.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.060]   That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad,
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.220]   'cause I had to continue to taunt him
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.300]   in order to get him to sign, right?
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.120]   So that one hurt because,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.240]   and some people don't know my MMA career,
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.080]   I'll just go through it fast.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.500]   I did three fights in smaller leagues.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.600]   I got signed by Bellator.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.560]   I was undefeated for three and a half years.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.500]   I was nine and O.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.540]   When I got done with that in 2012, no, 2013,
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.560]   at that point in my head,
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.400]   I was just gonna transition to the UFC,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.400]   'cause that's where you go.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.200]   I was ranked like sixth in the world.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.560]   I hadn't really had a competitive match
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.600]   at the end of the Bellator thing.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.620]   And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me,
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.820]   we still haven't had this conversation,
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.620]   I wish I could ask him, I should ask him sometime,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.540]   chose to refuse me any entry in the UFC.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.500]   He just said, I went to his office,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.780]   and he literally said, we're not interested,
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.420]   we're not gonna make you an offer.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.180]   - Did you mention something to, about him, about the UFC?
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.620]   - That was a year before that.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.460]   That was a year before.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.940]   And that might play a role in it, I think.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.540]   So yes, what happened the year before that was,
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.520]   I called him a liar, but listen, I'm right on this one,
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.000]   'cause he said you can't test for drugs,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.080]   'cause I'm all natural, which you can tell by my physique.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.920]   And I was always put off by the fact
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.680]   that so many people cheated.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.960]   And I was very vocal about that.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.800]   And so he had made some statement,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.160]   like, oh, there's no way you can test.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.240]   I said, bullshit, very specifically,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.040]   I said, USADA does it for all other sports worldwide.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.920]   You can do it.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.280]   And then it was funny, 'cause I hired USADA
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.400]   a couple years later.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.860]   So I think he took some offense to that.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.760]   But that was like a year and almost a year and a half,
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.160]   I think, somewhere later.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.880]   - It's not like he holds a grudge or anything.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.280]   (laughing)
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.400]   - Yeah, so I literally go to Vegas.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.360]   It's a long story, you can read about it other places.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.680]   So I got released from a belt.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.960]   It's not like this is a negotiation.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.400]   I got released from my belt or contract.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.280]   I said, I'm outta here.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.360]   I'm going to the UFC.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.720]   I go to Vegas, and then I was told,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.320]   hey, there's no offer for you.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.760]   Tough shit, you know?
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.420]   So then I ended up signing with one championship.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.720]   I spent, what, three and a half years there.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.020]   I won the belt in my second fight
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.980]   and retained the title the entire time.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.820]   And then I just--
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.980]   - Again, dominating people.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.820]   - Yeah, I didn't have a competitive fight.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.460]   And so I retired 18 and 0.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.700]   Never, and for someone who loves a challenge,
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.260]   never getting to really challenge myself
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.940]   was incredibly frustrating.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.340]   And I left the door open.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.700]   I said, if I ever get the chance to prove I'm in this world,
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.900]   I'd love to come back.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.960]   So somehow, a year later, I get traded.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.800]   Trades have never happened.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.700]   This is the one and only trade ever.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.840]   I had been retired for a year.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   I got traded.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.680]   I get to come back.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.560]   I fight Robbie Lawler in the first fight.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.520]   I win.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.600]   And then essentially they're saying,
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.800]   okay, if you fight, you know,
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.760]   if you beat George,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.680]   you're gonna get the title shot against Marty.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.120]   And it's like, this is what I've been working for.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.620]   I've been trying to prove I was the best fighter in the world
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.460]   for the last 10 years,
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.980]   and I have not been afforded this opportunity.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.320]   So when I lost to George, that was hard
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.260]   because it was something that I had waited for
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.160]   for a really, really long time.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.240]   It was something that I thought I could compete for,
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.080]   and I never got the opportunity to do.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.260]   So that one was hard.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.760]   At the same time, from just the competitive logistic,
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.260]   it's like, he got me with one move.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.120]   It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.440]   and I got beat a bunch of different ways.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.420]   So that was like, fuck, if I get it again,
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.260]   I could have done it,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.720]   but they're not gonna let me have it again.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.680]   It's not like wrestling where you could go the next year
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.400]   or the next week or whatever, you know?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.000]   You lose a big 10, you go to Nationals two weeks later.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.580]   - Does that loss change you in any way, your psychology?
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.060]   - I don't think so.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.580]   - It's the first loss.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.380]   - I mean, had I had a longer MMA career post that,
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.940]   there definitely would have been a lot of time spent
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.980]   getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.700]   Which I'd already spent time there.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.860]   And I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip,
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.300]   the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't do
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.440]   was preventing me from doing some things.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.980]   And that's why, if you look at the fight,
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.500]   I'm like bent over as they go for the double leg.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.340]   Yeah, so I--
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.300]   - So what happened for people who don't know,
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.500]   you went in for a double leg and he went--
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.340]   - Flying knee.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.540]   - He did a flying knee.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.380]   - And the way--
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.200]   - Caught you well.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.620]   - Specifically the way he did that knee
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.940]   was kind of different than the way
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.380]   anyone had thrown flying knees before.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.100]   Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.220]   whereas he took a few like running steps
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.340]   and went more, you know,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.660]   the trajectory of the angle was different.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.780]   So I think that's kind of probably why it caught,
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.440]   you know, I think a lot of things in combat,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.280]   well, probably everything,
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.840]   but I focus specifically on combat,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.120]   happens subconsciously, like our brain is reading
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.640]   what's coming at us.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   And a lot of times it's stuff we've seen before
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.080]   so we can judge how to move correctly.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.760]   - And you misread because it's something
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.600]   you haven't seen before.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.360]   - I had not seen him come at that specific angle, yeah.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.840]   So that loss was really hard.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.120]   With the Burroughs one, I told you,
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.240]   I knew I was gonna lose.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.320]   So it was like, whatever, you know,
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.800]   I'm taking this because I want to put
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.600]   the sport of wrestling out there in a big way.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.020]   I want to help them raise a lot of money.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.340]   We sold the Madison Square Garden Hulu Theater
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.460]   and we raised a whole bunch of money.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.280]   So my goals were accomplished.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.420]   Jake Paul fight, I took it because it paid me
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.020]   a whole bunch of money and I thought it was gonna be fun.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.060]   Did I have any illusion?
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.700]   I was a great boxer, no illusions whatsoever.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.180]   Would I have preferred to win?
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.820]   Absolutely, but you know, like I told everyone,
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.320]   whether I win or lose on Saturday night,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.180]   I'm gonna be back coaching wrestling on Monday
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.380]   'cause that's what I enjoy doing.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.300]   And I was back coaching wrestling on Monday.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.900]   And once a month, these middle school kids
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.580]   give me a little bit of shit about it and that's it.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.920]   - But where were you in terms of your shape
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.940]   and how you felt in the Masvidal fight?
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.580]   Would you say you're on the, I mean,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.020]   it's a difficult question to ask of a world-class athlete,
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.540]   but like, were you past peak?
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.380]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.020]   And I don't know why guys like to lie about that.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.460]   I mean, the peak for me was really evidently
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.680]   in my late 20s and maybe they are all fueled
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.420]   by extra supplements, I don't know.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.100]   But for me, that was evident.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.620]   But you get this, so you get this crosshair
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.220]   where if you're smart, like I mentioned,
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.380]   Jon Burrows was, you're still gaining wisdom,
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.820]   you're gaining strategy, gaining a lot of things, right?
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.140]   And so while your physicality may go down,
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.520]   your overall skill level still may be rising,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.060]   especially in MMA because people usually start later
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.860]   'cause they're gaining wisdom, strategy,
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.060]   all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right?
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.980]   They're getting all these things.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.440]   So their actual competitive peak,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.100]   despite their athletic peak going down
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.860]   might still be a few years past that, right?
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.780]   Because these things are crossing.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.400]   No, so I felt I was great.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.320]   Obviously the hip was an issue.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.580]   It's funny because so that,
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.500]   I knew I had a lot of pain here
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.100]   and I knew it was because of this.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.260]   And it was like, okay, whenever I'm done,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.580]   I'll just get it taken care of, whatever.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.680]   But every time I train, I have pain kind of like
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.260]   all up my back.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.140]   And the day after the surgery, I woke up
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.380]   and there was no pain on the right side of my,
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.500]   the surgery was on the left side.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.740]   There's no pain on the right side of my back.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.020]   I'm like, that's fucking weird.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.260]   Like every morning I wake up,
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.160]   there's a lot of pain there, you know?
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.500]   I'm like, okay, well, I'm on pain pills.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.140]   Maybe it'll come back tomorrow.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.180]   And that's 'cause I never have been back since my hip surgery.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.260]   So it was weird 'cause it was like this.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.160]   I thought this was affecting this,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.480]   but it was affecting all the way across my whole back.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.740]   So if I get to get a new hip, honestly,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.500]   if I, I don't know if it's gonna change
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.700]   the competitive outcome whatsoever.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.620]   If I had known how good the hip replacement was gonna be,
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.580]   I would have done it the second I retired
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.560]   from one championship in November of 2017.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.820]   I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December 1.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.340]   Just from a lifestyle standpoint,
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.460]   I could only sleep in one position.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.660]   There was a lot of things I couldn't do.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.280]   I was in a lot of pain.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.780]   So I would have done that a lot earlier.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   But no, from an athletic point, I was ready to,
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.340]   this shit goes wrong sometimes.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.460]   - I don't know how to ask this, but you know,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   Joe Rogan, me, had a sense about you similar to like Fedor,
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:11.120]   that you are potentially one of the greatest ever.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.140]   - Yeah.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.500]   - Does it hurt that you're not in the discussion now
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   of being in the top 10 of all time?
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.660]   - I didn't prove it.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.980]   I don't deserve it.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.580]   - But you had a, I mean--
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.620]   - But I didn't prove it.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.860]   I mean, and so it's like,
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.220]   had I somehow gotten to convince Dana White,
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.060]   we go and convince him in 2013 to make me an offer,
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.180]   and I didn't even need a good offer, I just needed any offer.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.820]   Had I gotten the offer then,
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.820]   maybe the outcome's different, right?
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.020]   But given, I would never expect anyone
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.200]   to think of me that way.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.100]   I didn't prove it.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.460]   I know what I was, and I'm good with that.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.180]   And yeah, other people never got to see that.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.340]   - Do you think, well, you don't know,
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.020]   you can't know fully, right?
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.820]   Do you think if you went to the UFC at that time
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.900]   instead of one championship--
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.220]   - I think it would have had a lot of success.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.060]   Yeah, I mean, there's obviously certain guys,
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.380]   there's a lot of guys I've trained with
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.620]   that I had a lot of really good results against.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.860]   And obviously--
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.060]   - Who was the Walter Waite at that?
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.260]   - Tyron was the champion for a long time there.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.860]   So I was around, Tyron was the champion,
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.180]   Anthony was the champion at lightweight.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.340]   I was, you know, same gym as him.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.340]   And we had a lot of people coming through.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.160]   Yeah, I--
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.740]   - Would you face Tyron?
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.580]   - Would I have fought him?
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.540]   I don't think so.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.740]   I mean, so he was still the champion
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.340]   when I came into the UFC,
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.380]   and we said no, we were not gonna fight.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.660]   - All right.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.520]   - Hey, so he can't change history, right?
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.460]   So once something happens,
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.460]   you gotta accept for what it is and move forward.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.340]   And obviously hope you can continue
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.700]   to keep accomplishing great things,
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.380]   which for me, obviously my athletic career is over.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.380]   So now it's gonna be through my wrestling academies
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.180]   and who knows what else I get into.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.300]   - You might do exhibition matches
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.660]   and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.500]   - Says who?
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.540]   - Wrestling and stuff, no?
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.420]   - I don't think so.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.940]   So here's my thing with the wrestling matches
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.740]   is just for fun, if you said, "Hey, Ben, just for fun."
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.580]   - Yeah.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.560]   - Would you love to go wrestle someone?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.180]   Yeah, I would, I would, right?
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.620]   I love wrestling, I get in there.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.180]   You know, I love, so one of my guys
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.420]   has gotten to be pretty good.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.940]   He's in college, a guy named Keegan O'Toole.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.120]   He just won a junior world title this year.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.220]   And so when I'm doing private lessons,
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.020]   I have to think about the development of the athlete.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.100]   Sometimes I can wrestle hard,
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.520]   but most of the time it's like,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.820]   I'm just gonna help them with whatever they need help with.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.200]   And it's still wrestling and it's fun,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.520]   but it's helping them.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.260]   You know, for like, Keegan comes back this summer
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.340]   and he's training for the junior world title.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.900]   So to be able to just shake hands sometimes
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.300]   and say like, "How much do I kick your ass?"
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.620]   To you, try to kick my ass, you know, like just to go.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.460]   - Yeah, it's a good feeling.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.520]   - It's so much fun.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.780]   And I don't get to do that very much.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.660]   So if you said, "Ben, would you love to do some matches?"
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.300]   And the answer's yeah.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.520]   The problem, unfortunately for me,
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.540]   and maybe you can talk me off a ledge here,
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.780]   is like because of where I've gotten to in my career,
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.100]   if I choose to do a wrestling match,
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.780]   people are gonna be really excited about it.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.020]   It's gonna blow up and it's like,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.380]   I just wanna wrestle just to wrestle.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.140]   I'd rather just like go in a room
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.980]   where no one can watch and just wrestle and just enjoy it.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.540]   - Well, you could also wrestle,
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.340]   so there's different kinds of wrestling.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.920]   There's wrestling where there's an event
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.300]   and like, you know, there's a buildup and an announcement.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.140]   - Yeah.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.600]   - And you can also do like a Khabib style,
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.620]   like in the room there's cameras and you're kind of going.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.460]   It's like-
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.280]   - Wait, Khabib does that?
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.620]   - No, in-
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.460]   - Marcel does that.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.300]   He whooped my ass a few times.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.340]   I mean, I've seen Khabib with some videos.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.780]   It's not like set up, it's just people going hard
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.380]   and then it's more fun.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.220]   - Yeah.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.340]   - You know, and it's also more like
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:38.380]   presenting the beauty of the sport, you know?
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.220]   - For sure.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.780]   - And like, and there's no winning or losing really
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.940]   in that context.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.780]   - Yeah.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.900]   - Like you're just, you're always joking around a little bit
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.140]   even when you're going super hard.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.340]   So I feel like, especially in the modern day
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.420]   with the internet, that's a compelling way to do.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.260]   - So I've thought about, this is the one thing
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.220]   I've thought about doing, 'cause I told you about my buddy
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.300]   who is the content thing, it's called Rockfin.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.140]   Thought about doing, you know,
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   the old really famous Gracie challenge?
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:03.980]   - Yeah.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.220]   - Okay, so I thought about doing the Aspen challenge.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.140]   You wanna hear my rule set?
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:06.980]   - Yeah, let's go.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   - I'm not sure I'm gonna do this.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.780]   People are gonna show up to your, like in Wisconsin.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.620]   - I have to select you.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.220]   I'll start with a thousand bucks, right?
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.060]   - Right.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.980]   - Okay, 30 minutes.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.460]   You pin me or I pin you.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.300]   That's it.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.220]   No points, no nothing.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.180]   We just wrestle.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.500]   Camera, that's it, right?
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.340]   It's camera in the room.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.980]   Maybe there's a referee 'cause we don't want there
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.420]   to be contention over the pin.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.260]   So--
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.080]   - Just one pin.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.920]   - Just one pin.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.420]   30 minutes, 30 minutes, okay?
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.620]   If I pin you, you don't get shit, you go home, right?
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.500]   Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.640]   2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, and so on.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.480]   If you make it the distance and I don't pin you
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.340]   and you don't pin me, I'll pay for your travel
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.160]   and give you 500 bucks, right?
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.660]   Just a kind of consolation prize for showing up.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.020]   If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.780]   - Wait, who's adding to the jackpot?
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.820]   - I am, it's my money.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.660]   My money.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.660]   - But then what's the incentive to keep winning for you?
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.500]   'Cause the jackpot's--
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.300]   - Well, 'cause I would put the content somewhere
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.140]   and people would watch it, right?
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.140]   - Oh, so you're gonna make money.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.980]   - Yeah, so you'd make money that way.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.700]   - But it's not exponentially growing, right?
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.380]   It's just going up by like--
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.860]   - Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.820]   of people that could pin me.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.280]   So I would either just not choose those people
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.620]   or wait 'til I get a really large audience
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.700]   and people get really excited.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.780]   And in that case, I'm making a lot of money, so.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.700]   - What do you think, how many matches would go with you,
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.500]   like Khal Dake shows up?
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.860]   - I don't think he could pin me.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.780]   - Yeah, how would that match go?
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.180]   - Jordan Burroughs could beat me, but he can't pin me.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.700]   He was never a pinner.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.660]   He ain't gonna pin me.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.140]   There's only a few people who have the skill level
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.340]   to do so, right?
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.180]   It takes a lot.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.560]   So pinning was one of my specialties.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.460]   I had the fourth most of all time
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.760]   and I won the pinning award the last two years.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.260]   - So you can be down on points and just pin them.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.180]   - This is actually one of the issues I have with jujitsu
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.020]   and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.300]   I actually think the Eddie Bravo thing's kind of,
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.300]   people get so mad at me.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.260]   Sorry, jujitsu.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.740]   I think it's bullshit.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.220]   And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.140]   So if Jordan Burroughs whoops my ass
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:58.460]   and the score is 16 to two, but he can't pin me,
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.860]   then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him,
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.800]   I'm probably gonna pin him.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.680]   So I'm better than Jordan Burroughs?
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.980]   Nah, that ain't right.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.420]   He just whooped my ass.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.420]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.620]   If we can go the whole, 'cause they do submission only.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.800]   So if Jordan Burroughs beats me up
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.340]   for what, is it eight minutes, 10 minutes?
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.260]   I don't know, what's the length of an Eddie Bravo match?
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.100]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.100]   - Something like that, yeah.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.540]   - So we go 10, me and Jordan Burroughs go 10 minutes.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.180]   He's gonna outscore me significantly.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.220]   He will not pin me, I promise you that, okay?
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.180]   So now we go to the overtime.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.420]   - Strong words, but yeah.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.060]   - He won't, Jordan Burroughs is not gonna,
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.860]   he's gonna beat me, I will give you that.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.100]   - Kyle Dake won't pin you either.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:35.940]   - No. - Okay.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.860]   - Okay, they will both beat me on points very badly.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.380]   Now David Taylor, he might pin me
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.660]   'cause he's a very good pinner also.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.120]   They'll beat me very badly, they will not pin me.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.340]   But now we get to overtime and we get to pick,
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.780]   all right, so in Eddie Bravo,
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.460]   you get a rear naked choke or an arm bar.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.900]   Okay, give me a cradle, I'll probably pin him, okay?
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.940]   A good cradle.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.940]   You can say cradle or maybe give the,
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.220]   they're probably not gonna pin me, right?
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.180]   Maybe there's a chance, but probably not
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.020]   'cause that's just not their specialty.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.340]   - Yeah, so for people who don't know,
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.340]   the Eddie Bravo thing is, and it goes into overtime,
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.020]   you get a dominance position on a person
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.220]   and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.180]   This is the wrestling equivalent.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.780]   - Yeah. - But you take their back
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.380]   or maybe an arm bar, yeah, a wrestling arm bar.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.660]   So and I don't think that's very fair
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.820]   'cause if someone whoops your ass,
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.860]   they whoop your ass and then, you know.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.700]   And so I think the reason why Jiu-Jitsu people
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.660]   accept that rule set is that I don't think,
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.980]   I think they know this but would admit it,
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.860]   I don't think their point scoring system
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.860]   adequately rewards what people value.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.500]   So like in wrestling, we value takedowns
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.060]   'cause it gets us closer to the pin
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.220]   and the most valuable scoring is a near fall,
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.660]   near to the pin because that's the ultimate goal of the sport
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.220]   whereas in Jiu-Jitsu, for example,
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.780]   like if I were to get a takedown,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.260]   so like if I went to Gordon Ryan
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.300]   and he just didn't pull guard,
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.060]   I would probably get the takedown.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.100]   Now, if somehow he didn't submit me,
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.180]   which he probably would, right?
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.260]   But say he got close to like 12 submissions
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.680]   but somehow I slipped out of all of them.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.940]   Now I win two-zero, like that's ridiculous.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.220]   Like he should very clearly win
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.860]   'cause he almost submitted, you know what I'm saying?
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.860]   And I realize the difficulty,
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   I realize the difficulty in rewarding near submissions
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.100]   but that is the most valuable thing
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.060]   is getting close to finishing the match
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.180]   and in most competitions, they don't actually reward that.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.460]   - But okay, so this isn't about the sport.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.780]   This is about the Ben Askren challenge
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.620]   that we're talking about.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.300]   (laughing)
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.260]   Why 30 minutes?
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.640]   Why not unlimited time?
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.340]   Why go until whenever?
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.880]   - Well, 'cause then it's just a cardio thing
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.100]   'cause at some point,
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.340]   then someone would just have to fall over dead, right?
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.800]   There's no more skill level involved.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.840]   It's just who can stand up the longest.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.360]   - You honestly don't think,
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.600]   30 minutes is a cardio thing too.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.320]   How do you think that's actually gonna look?
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.380]   Kyle Dade going against you for 30 minutes.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.260]   - So it's gonna be kind of boring for the most part.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.840]   - What position are you going to be stuck in?
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.480]   - But you just can't have a gigantic amount of action
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.320]   for 30 minutes.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.240]   So I relate to this 'cause some of my kids
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.280]   when I'm teaching them wrestling,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.560]   they're like, "Well, but I can't do that for seven minutes."
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.000]   And I'm like, "Well, say if I had you do
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   "hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.340]   "as hard as you could, you're not gonna last seven minutes.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.640]   "Your pace will slow down."
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.720]   So my thing is like,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.000]   well, your pace doesn't have to step here
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.900]   'cause in wrestling, you're competing against someone.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.400]   So if you're here at 100 and you go to 80,
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.120]   but they go to 70, that's great.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.360]   And then you go to 60, but they go to 40,
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.480]   this is even better because the gap is growing.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.840]   So we don't necessarily, if we get tired, that's fine.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.720]   If they get more tired, that's better.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.440]   So I think most people would know that.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.160]   So they would kind of slow it down.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.680]   But yeah, I think at 30, I mean,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.040]   I've wrestled 30 minute goes,
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.400]   I've wrestled hour long goes.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.600]   You're not gonna get so tired,
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.020]   you're gonna fall over in that time period.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.160]   But at some point, if it's unlimited,
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   someone will get so tired or dehydrated
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.620]   that they're just gonna freaking fall over.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.680]   - Yeah, but you think,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.220]   what about making it exciting and dynamic?
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.600]   You think the other person
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.840]   is always going to be going for the pin
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.680]   and thereby make it dynamic?
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.880]   - Well, if they're working that hard,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.040]   then they might exhaust themselves.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.980]   And obviously then if you're being that dynamic,
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.240]   then you're adding risk to yourself too
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.680]   because you're doing that.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.520]   - Well, I love this, this is a great idea.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.760]   (laughing)
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.080]   - Well, I figure I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.860]   or not as great people in the beginning.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.920]   And then I would start bringing in better people
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.840]   'cause they would be enticed by $20,000,
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.680]   the possibility to win.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.400]   - And not much fanfare, just a camera and just--
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.200]   - Just a camera, that's it, in my wrestling room.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the Gracie Challenge.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.360]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.000]   And so then maybe you have like,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.120]   for most people, you have someone edit the 90 seconds
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.760]   of the most fun things that happen,
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.720]   and then you can watch the entire 30 minutes if you want to.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.800]   I mean, I think most people,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.000]   if they're not really, really elite,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.400]   I'm probably gonna pin them.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.800]   If they're not really elite.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.640]   So, yeah, but I don't know.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   That's something I've been thinking about,
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.940]   this has been fun for me to think about.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.400]   And obviously it plays to my skill sets
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.960]   'cause my cardio is good and my pinning is good also.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.160]   So, yeah.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.480]   - So, like you said, you weren't very good
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.360]   in your early days until 13, 14.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.560]   What was the switch?
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.120]   You started to dominate people.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.080]   In your college career, you dominated.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.560]   And obviously, you stopped losing at some point.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.440]   - Yeah, so, well, I would say,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.040]   so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition,
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.360]   I would go in the summers and try to make the world team.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.620]   So, I would lose some, not a lot, minimally.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.680]   Okay, so when I'm five, I start playing all sports.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.480]   I know you moved to America at what age?
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.320]   - 13.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.680]   - Okay, so five, so at least,
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.080]   I don't know what it was for you,
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.560]   but in America at my age,
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.160]   you usually played a sport every season, right?
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.560]   So, that's what I did in the beginning.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   I had minimal success in wrestling.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.120]   I was kind of chunky.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.000]   And then, in fifth grade, I don't,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.360]   and I can't tell you, I wanted to be better.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.920]   And I told my parents, and this is funny,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.240]   'cause now I look at other 11-year-olds,
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.880]   and very few of them are this mature.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.280]   And I actually think emotional maturity
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.520]   is kind of one of the key indicators
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.160]   of how long-term successful someone's gonna be.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.000]   And at age 11, I said, "I don't wanna play baseball.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.440]   "I like baseball, but I don't wanna play baseball
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.280]   "'cause I wanna wrestle more,
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.800]   "'cause I wanna get better at wrestling."
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.640]   So, age 11, I quit baseball so I could wrestle in a club
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.920]   for March, April, and May,
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.280]   'cause that was all that existed at that point in time.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.480]   You couldn't wrestle in June, July,
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.980]   or any of those other months.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.720]   What was that desire to get better?
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.560]   What is that?
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.380]   So, it's not about winning.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.220]   I don't know where it came from.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.240]   I just wanted to get better.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.080]   I wanna get better.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:44.920]   I wanna be good at this.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.740]   I wanna be really good at this.
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.920]   So, when you're looking at kids now, as a coach,
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.080]   you're looking for that.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.440]   Somebody who says, "You know what?
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.280]   "I kinda suck.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.120]   "I wanna get better."
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.360]   And I wanna try to also inspire that.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.320]   I mean, honestly, I think, as a coach,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.400]   that's probably my biggest job,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.920]   is to get a kid and get them to believe, "I can do this."
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.240]   'Cause if I can do this, what can I?
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.360]   I can do that.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.800]   I can do that, too, right?
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.680]   And there's so many kids who, unfortunately,
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.120]   have shitty parents or bad teachers
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.220]   that tell 'em, "You suck.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.760]   "You can't be anything," right?
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   So, I think my biggest goal, as a coach,
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.240]   is to get someone to believe they can do it.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.320]   So, actually, some of the ones that believe they can do it,
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.200]   they're the most fun,
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.400]   but they're not the ones who need it the most, right?
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.400]   The ones who think they can
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   are the ones that need me the most.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.320]   'Cause they need someone to, "Fuck, let's go."
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.160]   So, I don't know.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.000]   What inspired me, I'm not sure.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.920]   So, age 11, fifth grade, I quit.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.520]   So, then I started having more success,
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.360]   you know, where I'm, like, say,
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.920]   placing at the state tournament.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   - In high school.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.040]   - So, you're right.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.200]   So, sixth grade, I placed at the state,
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.680]   the local youth state tournament, you know?
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.980]   So, I'm having more success.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.880]   Seventh grade was the first year
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.160]   I won the youth state tournament.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.160]   So, I'm getting better.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.120]   but when I went to the national tournaments,
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.220]   I was still having really minimal success.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.880]   My freshman year, I decided to quit football.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.720]   Same reason, it's like,
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.920]   well, I need to put more time into this.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.040]   My parents, we got, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.720]   So, you know, there's no, so we have a year-round club,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.120]   and our impetus was that we didn't have this opportunity
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.880]   to go to a club year-round.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.040]   So, we had a mat in my basement.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.080]   I had to go find, "Hey, you wanna come wrestle?"
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.840]   Like, "Oh, yeah, to find partners for myself."
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.680]   - What'd you do?
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.500]   Did you drill?
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.400]   Did you live wrestle?
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.720]   What'd you do in that basement?
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.600]   - So, actually, I think, you'll enjoy this.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.000]   I think the start of my scrambling
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.440]   was kind of based around that.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.320]   So, I got kind of,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.680]   I think it's probably my freshman, sophomore,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.960]   I'm kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.400]   It's been a while. - For sure.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.160]   - But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year,
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.600]   I found two kids who were really consistent,
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.080]   who would come out, like, you would come out on,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.000]   he would come out on Tuesday,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.640]   and this dude would come out on Wednesday, right?
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   And they would come every week,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.040]   and they were really consistent partners for me
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.340]   to have in the summer.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.960]   But they weren't nearly as good as me.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.840]   They were way worse.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:03.840]   So, it's like, okay, how do I make this kind of fun
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.680]   and compelling for them to come back?
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.000]   'Cause if I just whooped their ass,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.880]   they're not gonna come back.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.280]   So, it was like, I would let them get as close as they could,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.420]   as I thought they could do a takedown
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.600]   before not getting it,
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.920]   and then try to escape or get out.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.360]   So, obviously, if I let them get really close,
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.440]   sometimes they get it, so they're enjoying it.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.520]   I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.420]   I have no idea.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.640]   And that was kind of the start,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.880]   is I had to figure my way out of bad positions,
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.280]   because I had to try to make it entertaining for them,
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.480]   where they still got something out of it,
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.960]   and they wanted to come back the next week.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.440]   And I also got something out of it.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.720]   - Yeah, I love this.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.880]   'Cause that relationship is so important.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:44.480]   I've had a few drilling partners,
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.920]   training partners that were really important to my life,
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.680]   and I always wonder why it's difficult,
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.480]   why it's so difficult to find them.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.320]   - Yeah.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.720]   - Like, if anyone's listening to this,
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.840]   I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area, actually.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.240]   Getting the reps with people is hard, even in jujitsu.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:06.520]   It's just like, people wanna do the fun stuff,
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.440]   they don't wanna really put in the work,
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.400]   and it takes a certain kind of personality.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.920]   And then you also have to make it fun for the other person,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.760]   just like you said.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.000]   If there's a skill mismatch,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.620]   but also if you have an interest mismatch,
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.360]   in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do,
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.200]   all that kind of stuff,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.960]   you have to figure out ways to make it fun.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.840]   It's tricky.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.680]   So you did.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.920]   - So yeah, I think I did that, and no one told me.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.280]   I get frustrated, 'cause now we have,
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.960]   just in my academy, we probably have 50, 60 high school
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.200]   kids only that are year-round, they're year-round.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.880]   Maybe they're not as consistent in the summer or whatever,
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.700]   but they're there.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.160]   So when they don't have a great partner,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.760]   they start whining, it's like, "You little bitches."
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.040]   Some days I get really mad about it,
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.280]   'cause it's like, I had no partners.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.680]   I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.040]   You guys, there's still 22 people in the room.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.240]   I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you,
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.760]   but go work out with that dude.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.600]   - Yeah.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.420]   - You know?
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.160]   - So what was the switch, the change?
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.480]   Was it gradual?
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.320]   - Gradual.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.140]   - Okay.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:03.980]   - Yeah, so, let's do this.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.960]   So ninth grade, I quit football,
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.360]   'cause I wanted to get really serious.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.200]   - What position, football?
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.440]   - It was actually a nose tackle.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.120]   But at that point, so I was also,
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.460]   the other thing I kind of left over,
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.680]   I was really fat growing up.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.320]   In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I'm really fat,
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.400]   and if I want to be competitive wrestling,
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.940]   I shouldn't be fat, 'cause weight matters.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.540]   I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:28.440]   So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.840]   So I still wasn't as heavy as I was in sixth grade.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.760]   So I was pretty small too,
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.800]   but I was also slow, unfortunately.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.640]   So they put me in nose tackle.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.360]   I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.160]   - So that's where you wrestled, 119?
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.400]   - My freshman year, yeah.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.680]   So yeah, so then I still,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.280]   I started having a lot of success state-wise,
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.920]   but not nationally.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.520]   It's my national success didn't come
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.980]   until my junior year in high school.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.120]   But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:55.960]   And then senior year,
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.620]   I started having a lot of success nationally,
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.380]   and I got recruited.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.780]   But then even when my freshman year of college,
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.420]   this is where I loved competing,
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.260]   I would go every weekend.
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.840]   'Cause I knew, if you take the emotions out of competition,
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:12.180]   all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them,
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.380]   and then figuring out what you need to work on, right?
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.760]   If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.060]   So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman,
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.420]   which is incredibly rare.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.740]   I had 10 losses.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.940]   So it's not, and like to not so great guys, you know?
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:28.020]   So my skill level still at that point was not that great.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.220]   And then the next year I came out
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.220]   and I made the NCAA finals.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.980]   So I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.940]   to the real freshman year.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.860]   - So a few questions.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.420]   Where did the funk style of wrestling,
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.820]   the creative style get developed?
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.460]   At which stage?
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.100]   - So I think looking retroactively,
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.780]   there was no intention to start
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.060]   when I was in high school with those kids.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.740]   But I think that's kind of like what was happening, right?
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.980]   So what I would really say is I had one influential coach,
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.820]   my redshirt year of college named Mike Ironman, great guy.
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.300]   But then the second thing was it was just out of necessity.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.460]   I had this burning desire to be the best.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.180]   And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.580]   'cause we had, you know, Tyron was there,
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.380]   we had All-American 157, we had All-American 184.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.020]   So I wasn't having a ton of success.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.100]   And very quickly I realized
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.460]   from like a more traditional athletic perspective,
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.460]   strength and speed, I couldn't keep up with anyone.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.100]   I was way worse.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.260]   So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I do this?
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.700]   You know, I wanna do this, how do I do this?
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.380]   There's gotta be a way, you know?
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.460]   So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things,
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.540]   but then it was just like this creative expansion
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.820]   for the next, you know, say three to five years.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.660]   And then even now it's like, I don't know,
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   there's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo,
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.420]   or there's something that's like fun
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.700]   about the way the body moves and works,
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.660]   and exploring something new and thinking about,
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:55.260]   hey, wrestling's been happening at a relative high level
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.820]   for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America,
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.380]   and there's still new things being developed.
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.460]   And so when you see something new,
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.860]   you're like, oh damn, Mike, that's great.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.700]   Or like Jason Nolte may have to win Dixie.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.420]   I'm like, why did I not think of that shit?
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:08.260]   Like, why did I think of that?
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.220]   It's so easy, I should have thought of that, you know?
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.900]   So there's this like obsession with the sport of wrestling
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.960]   and positions where,
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.620]   I actually think sometimes,
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:20.740]   thank God we didn't have smartphones,
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.380]   'cause I may have been distracted by my smartphone.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.780]   Maybe I wouldn't have been 'cause I was so obsessed,
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.900]   but maybe, but you know, some days I couldn't finish
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.620]   the single leg on a specific person,
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.740]   or maybe they were finishing on me,
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.060]   and it was like, go home,
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.900]   and I was just fucking obsessed about that one position.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.740]   Like, okay, what am I missing here?
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.780]   And not just accepting like that,
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.500]   whatever the coach says is the answer,
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:43.860]   but like, what am I missing?
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.620]   What ways can my body move
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.440]   that no one's told me it can move yet?
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.260]   Where can my arms go, right?
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.380]   Where can I do all these things?
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.820]   And so I would just obsess about these things.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.460]   And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.700]   and you say, oh, well, maybe this, you know?
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.380]   And maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.020]   Maybe it works twice and then it doesn't work the next time.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.140]   And so you kind of like have this creative process,
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.980]   and it's like, you know, there's a lot of things
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.020]   that are on the cutting room floor
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.660]   that never made it to the light
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:08.900]   because you thought they'd be good,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.380]   and they failed and they sucked.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:13.280]   And then, you know, to the point where like my senior year,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.780]   I got to this point where the people,
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.260]   then they were just figures,
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.860]   figures would wrestle in my head
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.300]   about positions I was thinking about.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.460]   I wouldn't tell them what to do.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.460]   They would just, they'd go in my head.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.320]   And then like, oh, fuck, wait, that's it.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.060]   That's it, like, that just happened.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.660]   That's the move, and then I'd go try to practice,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.680]   and sure enough, boom, that's the move.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.700]   - That's exactly where you have alpha zero playing,
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.620]   learning chess, you have--
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.900]   - Oh, no. - It's called self plays.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.420]   - You have, what, did the figures have like a clear--
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.140]   - No faces, they were just like--
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.580]   - Did they have a human form,
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.700]   or is it just like stick figures, essentially?
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.900]   - Oh, yeah, it was not like, yeah, it was not like humans.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.900]   It was more like stick figures.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.020]   It wouldn't stick figures exactly like they were.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.180]   - They had some volume?
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.020]   - Yeah, it was like a gray person,
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.540]   and they had, you know, three dimensions, essentially,
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:03.680]   'cause I had to see how the things moved, and yeah.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:09.300]   - I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:12.540]   at Google are, I don't know if you've seen,
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.420]   but there's something called reinforcement learning
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.980]   in artificial intelligence where you have like,
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.180]   they've done it for like sumo wrestling.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.100]   You have like, you have these two stick figures
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.200]   that don't even know how to get up at first,
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.660]   and they figure out how to stand on their two feet,
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.180]   and then they figure out how to push the other person
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.300]   off of the pedestal.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.620]   - But what about like, when you look at the Boston Dynamics,
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.940]   sometimes they have trouble with like jumping
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.500]   and balancing and the other stuff.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.700]   So are they doing that same program or no?
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:44.540]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:49.540]   This, everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard-coded,
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.860]   so it's not learning the,
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:57.420]   all the sophisticated movements and strategies,
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.900]   like high-level strategies and movement,
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:02.020]   that's all something that Boston Dynamics does not do,
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.860]   and if it does it, like the parkour stuff,
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.980]   that's all hard-coded.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.420]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.740]   - People like project and think like,
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.060]   these robots have like discovered
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.700]   like how to move in sophisticated ways they haven't.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.380]   - Well, that's why when you and John were talking about
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.740]   the grappling robot, I mean, the one thing I was,
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:26.660]   I was obsessing about in my head is that with the chess,
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.620]   right, if a chess piece moves, right,
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.380]   the horse can move like an L, right?
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.580]   It can only move like an L.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.140]   It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.740]   or seven meters per second.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.740]   It can only move there, right?
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.420]   Whereas like a single leg,
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:43.700]   I can shoot a single leg with many different velocities.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.260]   I can shoot at different angles.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:48.140]   I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.180]   I can shoot with my head up versus my head,
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.220]   I mean, right, all these things are gonna matter.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:55.380]   We're talking about a human being defending the single leg.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.900]   All of those things are gonna matter,
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.140]   and that's where human beings are, who wrestle,
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.860]   are calculating those things subconsciously.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.700]   They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.620]   oh, the force is coming at me at this,
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.660]   so I need to do that, right?
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.380]   They're just doing it because--
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.180]   - But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely,
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.100]   if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling,
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.780]   you're going to have to constrain the speed
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.140]   at which it moves and the power that it's able to deliver.
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.380]   So that presumably, there'll be the limitation.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.900]   So then it'll be just the same exactly as a human.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.420]   - But then, but it's even, so if we go human, max force,
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.460]   right, Jordan Bro's devil, max force, right?
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.160]   That's the highest we get, then we go down from there.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.100]   Even within that, it's like sometimes,
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.180]   I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of,
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.220]   I don't know, we'll just say 20 is the number, right?
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.760]   I don't always shoot it at 20,
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.580]   because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15,
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.560]   sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.860]   'Cause you feel something in your opponent
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.260]   that makes you do it differently,
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.740]   so they would have to learn how,
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.620]   and then all of these different things,
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.900]   and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder,
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.480]   so the robot would have to learn
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.380]   all of these different incoming inputs to the system
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.820]   and then create this reaction.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.340]   - Oh no, no, no, 100%, so this would be all continuous.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.460]   So unlike chess, it would not,
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.740]   it's just chess is discrete, there's, it's--
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.180]   - One and-- - You move,
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.300]   it's a very specific set of moves.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.100]   Now here, you would, those are all variables you control,
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.420]   and they're continuous variables,
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:23.460]   so the speed, the force, there's actuators,
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.940]   so there's all these joints, right?
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.600]   - Yeah. - You can move,
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.560]   I mean, it's just an optimization problem.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.180]   - It's kind of, it's fascinating,
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.560]   so I've been fascinated thinking about it
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.400]   since you guys talked about it.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.420]   It was a long time ago, I listened to it probably
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.260]   three to four weeks ago,
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.500]   and I've kind of been like obsessing about it ever since.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.180]   - Yeah, it just changes when,
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.780]   so unlike boxing, for example, or striking,
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:49.440]   once you grab a hold of somebody,
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.280]   it changes, you're now one body, right?
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.700]   So it's very complicated,
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.600]   it's not just shooting a double leg without,
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.120]   like maybe doing like, like faking a double leg
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.720]   and then shooting the double leg,
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.640]   that's very doable with robotics,
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.200]   but then like doing a clinch,
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.000]   and from there, doing like a Russian tie,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.360]   like that, that's, I think that's way harder
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.920]   than people realize in terms of
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.200]   how many things are involved,
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.120]   like the force of the grip,
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.400]   the leverage you're providing
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.000]   with all the different parts of the shoulder and the arm
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.760]   and the torso, the twist,
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.740]   how much of your weight are you allocating,
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.780]   like leaning on the other person,
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.540]   like taking weight off of one of your legs
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.420]   and the other leg, all of that.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.420]   I think that's the really interesting thing about humans
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.140]   is we're able to do all of this calculation--
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:38.980]   - Subconsciously.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.420]   - Yeah, subconsciously.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.420]   - Yeah, and that's what I've been thinking about
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.180]   since we, it's like, how many things,
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.660]   even these high school athletes
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.980]   who are like getting medium good
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.520]   are subconsciously thinking about all the time,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.140]   or not even thinking about, sorry, reacting to,
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:57.340]   but then even like for me, I'm a few orders of magnitude
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.540]   better than some of these kids that play,
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.340]   and so when I go like super hard,
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.460]   it's like I can feel their weight
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.660]   moving in the wrong direction,
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.940]   and so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.700]   is kind of easy sometimes, you know,
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.540]   because they're not feeling it the right way, right,
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.620]   or their timing's just a little bit off,
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.180]   or the way they're grabbing the hip,
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.740]   maybe they should be up a little higher, right,
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.540]   these really small things.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.080]   - Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.720]   for a robot, it's just there's so many things.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.000]   The big problem is ethically,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.220]   I don't know how many people are willing
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.820]   to train with a robot because you're gonna get hurt.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.360]   - Well, couldn't you make a robot train with a robot,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.200]   or no?
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.960]   - Yes, but then it's expensive.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.520]   So, 'cause they're gonna get--
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.040]   - Put the padding on that thing!
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.620]   - I know, but then it's not, you know,
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.200]   then you're not capturing the full--
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.040]   - Why can't you put some rubber coating on them,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.880]   or something to that effect?
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.280]   - You could, you could, you could.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.120]   I mean, you're talking about robots that are,
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.680]   these are humanoid robots,
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.320]   so we're talking about $500,000, million dollar robots.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.280]   So, you would have to be motivated--
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.920]   - To spend a lot of money.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.640]   - To spend a lot of money because you have to have them
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.360]   wrestle for a lot.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.200]   - To get better.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200]   - Yeah, to get better.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.620]   And then, the open question is,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:29.300]   how long does it take to get good enough to beat a human?
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:34.520]   I don't think we understand, I don't know,
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.720]   I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.560]   - Yeah.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.840]   - Like, is it a really hard problem?
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.440]   Like, what's harder, chess or wrestling?
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.640]   - Wrestling, by far.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.480]   And I am close.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.600]   That's, yeah, that's the sense I have.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.560]   - So, because there's an infinite amount of moves, right?
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.720]   And possibilities, so once I shoot the single leg,
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.960]   now you have X amount of choices.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.840]   Once you make your choice, now I have a choice,
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.040]   X amount of choices.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.160]   Now, you have X amount of choices on the defense,
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.760]   and we can just keep going back and forth, right?
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.280]   And this number becomes--
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.760]   - Yeah, but the same happens with chess.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.120]   - Correct, but then in wrestling,
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.320]   you have to make these movements very instantaneously, right?
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.160]   'Cause if I shoot a single leg,
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.000]   I'm not gonna wait and say, "What's your defense?"
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.840]   - Yeah.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.660]   - Right, you have to make it instantaneously,
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.320]   and also, again, based on the force and the vectors
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.160]   and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.600]   So really, if you're saying, "Why can't you shoot a single
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.440]   "leg?"
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.800]   It's not like moving the chess, it's not one move, right?
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.120]   If you wanna talk about different forces and stuff,
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.160]   it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.880]   based on how hard I shooted, the angle, the direction,
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.720]   all of those things.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.540]   - Yeah, but wait a minute.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.880]   So, robots can do this kind of stuff really fast.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.880]   People probably know the physiology of this,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.720]   but the reaction speed for a human
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.620]   is maybe 100 milliseconds, something like that.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.460]   I don't know.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.640]   From sensation to,
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.740]   like from the signal traveling up to your brain and down,
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.160]   I don't know what that number is,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.560]   but robots certainly could do it way faster.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.000]   You would actually have to constrain the speed.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.720]   - Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.560]   - Yes.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.860]   - So, yeah, theoretically,
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.300]   they could eventually beat wrestlers,
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.700]   but you asked what was hard, wrestling or chess.
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.540]   - Yeah.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.360]   - And I think wrestling is,
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.280]   because of the time component in it
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.960]   and the physicality of,
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.160]   is it this force or that force?
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.320]   'Cause if I'm gonna say,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.080]   say we're in a seatbelt side by side,
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.880]   a wrestling seatbelt, not a jujitsu,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.000]   based on the pressure you're giving me,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.560]   I might do a bunch of different things, right?
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.580]   And so, to an untrained eye,
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.020]   they might both look like the same thing from you.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.040]   To a trained feel, it's like,
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.320]   well, in one case, it's really evident
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.160]   I should go this way.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.260]   In another case, it's really evident I should go that way.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.960]   - So, the other thing to consider,
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.100]   just like with chess,
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.720]   the AI systems,
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.020]   so human versus human play a certain way together.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.280]   They actually haven't considered
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.960]   a really large number of strategies
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.440]   that AI systems discover.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.000]   So, one possibility with a robot,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.720]   they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.020]   - That's what I'm saying.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:03.160]   - That will dominate no matter what the human does.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.600]   - You think that, so you think there's that,
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.080]   so, I mean, so I'm talking about the wrestling's so fun,
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.040]   is there's, even after 80, 90 years,
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.720]   there's this continuous evolution.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.560]   So, you think-- - There'll be some
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.800]   like low single type thing,
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.840]   like John Smith type of situation.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.040]   - Well, like a down block go behind
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.580]   is something that has really,
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.560]   I would say really in the last five-ish years
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.720]   has really been evolved.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.600]   - What's a go behind?
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   - Down block go behind, so when you,
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.040]   well, it's head inside or head outside matters,
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.400]   but there's one for both.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.760]   You shoot at me, essentially,
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.160]   I take my leg, boom.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.320]   And then, so that was kind of in existence
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.320]   when I was in college, right?
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.600]   You down block 'em and you stop,
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.120]   but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.480]   And now, immediately, you shoot,
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   I attack that shoulder,
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.160]   and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right?
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.080]   And so, like that in its current incarnation,
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.080]   it absolutely wasn't around when I was in college.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.800]   I would say it probably became popular
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.080]   five to seven years ago.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.040]   So, yeah, there's these big things that are happening.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.400]   Now, I really wanna roll back
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.560]   'cause I wanna be ahead of the game.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.360]   I wanna know what I'm missing.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.000]   - I mean, one interesting thing you have
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.400]   with AlphaZero that plays chess
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:09.400]   is it sacrifices pieces much more than humans do.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.120]   So, it'll give you a piece,
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.840]   and not only does it give you a piece,
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.600]   it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.160]   - Because it knows that that's better for the long term.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.000]   - Long term.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.720]   So, like humans rarely sacrifice
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.920]   without getting the piece back
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.640]   like two or three moves after.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.320]   AlphaZero can wait like five moves.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:35.520]   So, basically, you'll have, potentially with wrestling,
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.560]   you might have a robot that puts itself in bad positions,
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.640]   but in a certain kind of way that will actually-
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.080]   - Lures the opponent in to trap them.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.920]   - Exactly.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.760]   - That's what my style's based on.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.480]   (laughing)
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.880]   - You basically narrow,
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.480]   one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.880]   You put yourself in a bad position,
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.200]   but it narrows the set of choices.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.400]   - For them, 'cause they're not used to it.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.120]   - Yeah, they're not used to it.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.160]   And then you drag them into your-
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.000]   - It's disgusting.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.840]   - Yeah.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.760]   So, but there's also,
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.880]   the problem is there's mechanical issues.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.040]   Like, it's actually just difficult to build robots
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.320]   that are able to sense,
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.720]   'cause we have sensation throughout our body.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.040]   It's just difficult to build that kind of robot.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:16.860]   It's expensive.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.600]   You start talking about multimillion dollars,
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.840]   and then people start asking questions.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.560]   Why did you invest all of this money?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.880]   - Don't ask me what moves I do.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.920]   Duh, hello.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.360]   - It could be better investment.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.640]   Okay.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.080]   So I mentioned John Smith.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.360]   He is, if people don't know,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.320]   one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.920]   He's also creative like you.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.680]   He spoke really highly of you.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680]   What do you think about that guy?
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.200]   Do you guys ever work together?
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.160]   - Not really.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.260]   So, you know what?
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.100]   When I was a senior
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.000]   and I had the people wrestling in my head,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.840]   I was lucky enough to be doing,
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.760]   I was pretty much graduated,
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.720]   so I did an independent study with the sports psych,
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.680]   I was potentially gonna go to grad school
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.520]   for sports psych.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.680]   Well, I actually did nine credits,
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.440]   and then I just decided I didn't wanna do it anymore.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.880]   I continued learning on my own.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.200]   But I did an independent study with the guy
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.800]   who's head of USA track and field sports psych.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.480]   So the class was,
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.520]   I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour,
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.320]   and he was fascinated by me.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.920]   So he didn't let me do homework.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.480]   It was the greatest three credits ever.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.320]   We just talked.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.160]   I learned so much.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.200]   It was so awesome.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.280]   But so I started,
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.480]   so one time it came up,
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.920]   I had these people wrestling in my head,
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.400]   and he said, "Well, who else do you think?"
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.760]   I said, "I bet John Smith happened."
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.040]   So I went and got John Smith's number,
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:29.880]   I called him and said,
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.480]   "Hey, you ever had these people wrestling in your head?"
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.600]   And he said, "Yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching,
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   "they went away."
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.880]   Same thing happened to me.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.640]   As soon as I started coaching, they went away.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.480]   So if I really force myself now,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.080]   and I'm like, I see something in practice,
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.160]   and it's really higher level,
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.200]   'cause high school wrestling,
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.520]   I don't wanna make you guys feel bad,
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.360]   but it's a little bit lower level, right?
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.520]   So if Keegan, for example, who won the,
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.000]   if he's struggling with a problem or asked me a question,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.640]   and I can force myself to see the bodies moving
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.960]   and think about it again,
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.400]   kinda like I was in early age,
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.840]   but it won't just flow there anymore.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.600]   So he said it went away, and for me, it went away also.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.440]   - By the way, if we can pause on the bodies in your head,
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.600]   how are they generating new ideas?
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.000]   Are they just kinda?
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.240]   - I don't know, you tell me.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.980]   - So it's just, they're just like scrambling in your head?
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.000]   - It would be specifically based on a problem
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.280]   I was struggling with, or a specific position.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.800]   - It goes in for a single and then go from there.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.960]   - Yeah, so I'm sitting in geography class,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.240]   and I don't have to work that hard 'cause it's easy, right?
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.000]   And yeah, I'm just sitting there,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.760]   like kinda acting like I'm looking at the board,
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.960]   and these guys are wrestling, and I'm watching them wrestle,
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   and yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.360]   - Is there somebody you looked up to style-wise?
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.360]   Like Gable, John Smith, all these legend status people.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.020]   - Gable, or it's not Gable, John Smith, but after the fact.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.380]   So the problem with wrestling in my era
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.740]   was you couldn't watch it.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.220]   There was no access, right?
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.540]   It wasn't really available.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.580]   Even if you wanna say go find a bunch of John Smith,
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.740]   man, they're kinda hard to find, right?
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.060]   There's a couple of them on YouTube,
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.040]   but I've obviously seen all of those,
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.060]   but in my era, there really wasn't any of it.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.540]   So it was hard to be a fan of something,
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.020]   and that's why wrestling has,
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.200]   the fans are going like this,
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.740]   because now you flip on the Flow app,
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:29.020]   and you can watch something that's happening in Europe,
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.660]   right, and we can do this easily,
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.640]   so we can be a fan of people.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.420]   So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then,
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.580]   because there just was no access.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.260]   So now I can watch someone I like and say,
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.020]   "Oh shit, that guy's wrestling.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.340]   "Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle,"
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.380]   you know, that type of thing.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:48.380]   - You know, on a quick rant, it's really frustrating
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.580]   that you can't watch the Olympics.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.660]   - Oh my God, so frustrating.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.900]   - I've been, I think I'm gonna go to war on this one.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.780]   - Go to NBC's headquarters, I'll go with you.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.700]   You got a soldier here.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.460]   - I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro,
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.980]   he was surprised by this too.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.220]   Most matches, you can't see,
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.860]   even you talk about like a comeback,
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.740]   Gable Steeles, and you can't see the full match.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.860]   You get like a crappy highlight.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.580]   So the two biggest things, and really the three,
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.100]   the NCAA championship's on ASPN,
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.820]   the Olympic trials are on NBC,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.100]   and the Olympics are on NBC.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.420]   And these companies are so big,
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.860]   they don't have a department dedicated
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.960]   to selling the rights to that footage, right?
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.100]   So the rights to wrestling footage,
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.540]   which no one really cares all that much about
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.620]   except a niche, are the exact same as track and field,
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.860]   or basketball in the Olympics.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.620]   So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.220]   The NCAAs, the Olympic trials, and the Olympics,
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.540]   you can't go watch old film on it, it sucks.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.140]   - Yeah, old or current film.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:54.620]   - So you can't even watch the Gable match?
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.700]   - The Gable Steeles, no.
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:59.020]   They do something that annoys the fuck out of me.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:13:59.860]   - What?
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.540]   - Okay, they do like a three or two minute highlight.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:09.060]   So it's like they capture the most important thing,
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.900]   but it's all about the buildup.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.860]   It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:19.300]   and the nerves and you walk out and like that.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.820]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.740]   You miss, then when the triumph happens
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.660]   or the heartbreak happens, it has that much more power.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.860]   - Yeah, if you wanna go to war with NBC or ESPN,
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.220]   I'm happy to join that.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.980]   - I think unfortunately, it's the IOC.
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:37.660]   - Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:41.940]   - IOC is selling for the Olympics is the one that's making.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.500]   - Well, so NBC broadcasts,
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.580]   so they obviously have the live rights.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.660]   You would think they would have recorded if they,
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.860]   I mean, they're the ones recording it.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.580]   You would think they keep the rights when you think.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.500]   - No, no, no.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.620]   They're getting a license of it.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.420]   They're getting exclusive like license,
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:59.740]   but like the, for example, I've had this,
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.460]   I talked to Travis Stevens, the judo player,
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:06.660]   and there's a really sort of famous match.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:11.580]   It's a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.340]   where he goes against a German, Oleg Bishov, whatever.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.620]   It's a 20 minute match to go to war,
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.300]   and that's not available anywhere,
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.780]   but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.220]   The reason I know this is on the IOC channel.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.380]   So they've uploaded all of these matches.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.780]   - They have it and put it up?
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:33.180]   - So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won,
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:37.020]   got put public, and so I don't know if it was private.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:39.100]   It got put up on YouTube.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.020]   I was alerted to it the week of my Jake Paul fight.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:42.860]   It was so dumb.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.700]   I'm like, what?
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.620]   This is 13 years later.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.660]   This is bullshit.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.780]   This should have been up.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:51.600]   So I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.060]   That has to be USOC then or NBC?
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:57.300]   So I know, okay, so I know Flow, right?
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.260]   'Cause I work for them.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:01.860]   I know if Flow buys your event or whatever, right?
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:03.380]   They buy the rights.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.500]   Generally in the contract,
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.420]   they'll have rights to both live stream it
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:09.420]   and then use that footage at any point moving forward.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.760]   So those matches live on Flow's website.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.900]   That's why I would be surprised
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.900]   that if NBC didn't have something similar.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.980]   - Flow does a pretty good job of providing
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.060]   like a place where you can watch all these matches.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:22.980]   NBC does not.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:23.820]   - Does not, yeah.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.100]   - And also there's an argument with Flow as well,
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.700]   but certainly with Olympics.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.900]   There's a difference between what Flow does
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:32.620]   and what the Olympics represent.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.780]   - What do you mean by that?
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.860]   - Like it feels like the Olympics,
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.100]   which is what the charter says,
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.300]   should be as accessible as possible.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.140]   - Yes, that's true.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.100]   - Like you should really lower the barrier
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.820]   for entry for the Olympics.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.020]   - You know that's what the charter says,
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.140]   but those people in the IOC,
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.380]   those are some of the worst people ever.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:51.220]   They're very bad.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.660]   - Well, they're not bad.
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:55.740]   They just lost touch of the dream they once had
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:56.900]   when they joined the IOC.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.940]   - Well, I would argue all the way back
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.140]   that these are rich fat cats who,
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.740]   like I get so mad about the NCAA,
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.380]   which finally now got rid of this term,
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.100]   bullshit term amateurism.
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.780]   It's like, well, there's some holy grail
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.180]   where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete,
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.860]   but the people who own the IOC
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.340]   or the people who own the institutions,
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.100]   college institutions are making boatloads of money
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.340]   off of you, that's crap.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:24.220]   - So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics.
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.340]   Did you believe you can win gold?
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.860]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.500]   - So your mental game was on point.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.420]   - Yeah, I was ready.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.460]   - So what went wrong?
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.860]   - I just wasn't good enough.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.820]   That was what I said.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:36.660]   - Yeah.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:38.460]   - Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time,
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.820]   it was my first year of international competition.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.340]   So when I came out in 2007,
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.300]   it was my first time making 74 kilograms,
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.540]   which is pretty small for me.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.900]   I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.500]   and I was having success in America.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.580]   I was beating everyone, I don't wanna say easy,
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.460]   but yeah, I was doing really well.
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:02.420]   I went international one time
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.700]   and there was one match I got cheated on,
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.900]   the Russians, they're cheaters.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.660]   I think it was Ukraine, not Russia.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:13.580]   I lost one real match where I actually lost
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.580]   and it was to Dennis Sargouche,
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.140]   who had gone to win three world titles,
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.940]   but he was behind as the T of that year
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.860]   and it was competitive, so I knew, okay,
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.820]   I'm going with the best guys in the world.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:27.700]   I beat a bunch of other guys who were good
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.620]   and had passed decent results.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.980]   So I knew I was right there.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.020]   Unfortunately, I ran into this guy, Ivan Fundora,
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.140]   and I had someone who scouted reports for him,
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:38.980]   actually my high school coach,
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.500]   who now coaches for our academy, John Messimerich,
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.540]   and Fundora was the worst stylistic matchup.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.900]   I got him and I lost him second round.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.620]   So I wasn't good enough.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.980]   Had I decided to keep wrestling,
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.060]   I probably would have gotten better,
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.860]   but at that point, I just wasn't in the cards.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.660]   - So in your division was, like you said,
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.700]   it's the T of, vice versa, it's the T of.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.140]   That guy is special.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.260]   - He's very special.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:04.140]   So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.900]   who I enjoyed watching and that was a guy,
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.220]   again, it was kind of after the fact
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.420]   because it was hard to access footage,
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.300]   but he was a lot of fun to watch.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.060]   - What do you think made him great?
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.300]   A lot of people talk about him
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.340]   as potentially one of the greatest ever.
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.180]   - Absolutely.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.980]   I mean, so he won six and three,
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.780]   six worlds, three Olympics, nine total,
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.220]   which there's only one or two people above that.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.020]   So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him,
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.420]   but from what I've seen, his feel is different.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.060]   He was just ahead of his time
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.540]   and the feel and the touch he had
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.460]   for certain moves and different things
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:43.300]   because obviously physically he's kind of unimposing.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.780]   He's taller and skinnier,
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.820]   which is, it can work in wrestling,
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:50.600]   but it is by less represented.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.520]   Yeah, he was special, so good.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.560]   - Do you take any inspiration from,
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.220]   let's talk about Dagestan in general.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:02.700]   What do you think makes those wrestlers great?
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.260]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.300]   Have you read the book, "The Talent Code"?
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.220]   - Yeah. - It's great.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.100]   And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:09.940]   all around the world.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.020]   So now, obviously with our wrestling academies,
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.500]   we try to take some lessons from that and apply it.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.300]   I got to assume, they didn't cover Dagestan
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.180]   in that book specifically,
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.100]   but I got to assume a lot of the same principles
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:26.360]   that are in that book apply to Dagestan and wrestling.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.720]   They did South Korea and women's golf.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.400]   They did Curacao in baseball.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.560]   They picked a lot of these other places
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.920]   that were really elite.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.760]   I think it was maybe Moscow in women's tennis also.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.560]   So I think all of these things
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:43.240]   that make any group great or organization
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.360]   is probably the same things that's happening there.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.600]   - Well, the hardship, I mean, what,
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.440]   is there something specific about wrestling
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.400]   that can create so many great champions?
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.020]   - From that area, so obviously they all love,
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.380]   like it's a big deal that wrestling
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.980]   is specifically is a big deal there.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.660]   You know, they do Sambo also, obviously.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.860]   So that's part of it is a lot of the kids are doing it.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.580]   They obviously are rough tumble, tough life.
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.780]   - Yeah, get in a lot of fights.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.460]   - And then I think that also that a lot of them,
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.700]   it is a way out, right?
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.740]   They're the elite level athletes in that part of the world
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.620]   from my understanding are really well compensated
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.220]   compared to what the average person makes
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.160]   and they're treated really well.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.900]   So people see it as a way out.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.780]   Whereas like, and then honestly,
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.420]   if America is getting better, but in 2008,
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.600]   the reason I went to MMA was 'cause
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.420]   I didn't wanna be poor my whole life.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.260]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.080]   It sucks.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:34.980]   It's like, well, I don't wanna make $20,000
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.100]   for the next four to eight years.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.020]   So I'm gonna go do something else.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.020]   If I could have made, even I didn't need to be rich, right?
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:43.540]   If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling,
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.180]   I probably would have kept wrestling.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:48.220]   So I think it's those factors.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.980]   And obviously now they have a really like
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.860]   a bunch of really good people in one area.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:55.380]   So there's probably, it's been going on for a long time.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:57.100]   So there's probably been a bunch of like adults
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.620]   and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress.
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.620]   So yeah, a lot of those things that happen.
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.220]   - So I'm definitely gonna travel there as I talk to him
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.260]   'cause I can speak Russian.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.600]   That makes it very,
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.660]   makes me uniquely qualified to-
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.500]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:15.260]   My brother can speak a little bit of Russian.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.980]   - Your brother can? - Yeah.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.700]   - Okay, like a little bit like two squares and hello?
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.340]   - No, no, no, no, like he would,
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.900]   oh man, don't be over so,
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.700]   I think he would be able to have a conversation with you.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.700]   I think. - Okay.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.460]   - Probably not like you.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.180]   - What's the reason he knows Russian?
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.060]   - I don't know why he got obsessed with languages.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.000]   And so his college degree is actually,
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.420]   what do they call it, interdis,
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.660]   where you have three minors.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:40.220]   So you had a minor in Russian,
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:45.220]   a minor in Spanish and maybe Japanese.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.180]   I'm messing up.
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.380]   It's definitely, it's Russian and Spanish for sure.
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.740]   I don't know what the third one is.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.900]   No, but yeah, Dagestan, it's really fascinating.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:57.020]   - But the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling,
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.060]   like they don't really go super hard.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.660]   - Yeah, and I only spent a couple,
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.340]   so I was there, I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008.
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:04.980]   That was where the World Cup was.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.020]   We had to train there for like two days afterwards.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:10.500]   So I didn't get to dig deep,
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:14.180]   did dig deep into what was going on or anything.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.180]   But yeah, I mean, I think sparring is very beneficial
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.180]   for wrestling.
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:24.460]   Not like, sparring in MMA is what we fight, right?
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.300]   Sparring in wrestling is,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.380]   so I always just describe it to be really simple.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.900]   If we're drilling, it's relatively 0% resistance.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.900]   If we're going as hard as we can, that's 100%.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.620]   There's all this gray area in the middle,
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:36.820]   that's sparring, right?
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.780]   And so if you have a good relationship,
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.580]   like, because a colleague of mine, my brother,
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.300]   we could just go and we know where each other's at.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.500]   We don't even have to talk about it, right?
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.900]   But like in my wrestling club, I'll say,
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.500]   "Okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position."
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.220]   Or, "I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot,
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.540]   "and this is for him, so I want him to go 70.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.180]   "And the defensive guy, I want you to go 40.
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.900]   "So you're not supposed to be trying to win here.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:00.740]   "You're gonna go a little lighter.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:03.500]   "I want you to give him some looks."
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.300]   So I think it has really taken hold in America.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.100]   I think it's really beneficial for success.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.500]   And I think that's, I mean, America's doing better
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.020]   than we've ever done historically.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.220]   - Well, that's 70 and 40, that's like an art form
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.380]   to find that right place.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:17.820]   'Cause like what the really good people I've trained with,
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.820]   they go much closer to 100% speed wise,
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:26.820]   or like, but without like forcing things
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:27.940]   the way you would when you're going.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.740]   It's some weird combination of things that,
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:33.360]   like if you truly earn a technique,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.540]   then you're given that technique.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.380]   But like, if you don't, you don't.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:42.300]   And then it becomes much less injury prone.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.580]   It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.500]   You don't get stuck in positions.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.540]   It's just a lot of movement.
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.260]   - Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about,
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:54.060]   you know, like different ways to learn and get better.
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:55.660]   And so I think John obviously innovated
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.380]   within the sport of jujitsu.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:03.580]   And so for us, and maybe there's a differentiator for us.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.300]   I think about it like-- - Sorry to interrupt.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.180]   You have this academy and you sent me this plan
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.060]   and you have a really well thought through plan
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.260]   for how to develop a good wrestler.
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:16.980]   - So I think it's, for me there's four categories, right?
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:20.220]   There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:22.380]   You're coming in and I'm showing you the move
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.660]   and you're literally going out there and you're trying.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.220]   To me, that's not even drilling.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.460]   That's like teaching, like you're trying to learn something.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.340]   So obviously in someone's earlier periods,
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.940]   they're spending a lot of time in that phase
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.380]   because they literally don't even know
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.660]   how to move their bodies the right way.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.900]   Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.180]   'cause you absolutely have to get those reps
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.140]   to become really proficient in that movement.
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.220]   And then the sparring and then the live, right?
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.380]   And so like, I think obviously by the time you get
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.780]   to the kind of, I don't know, the end point, right?
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:58.300]   But further on, the time you spend teaching is so,
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.580]   I don't wanna say, I'm sorry,
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:02.500]   in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.020]   but it's so much smaller because to someone
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.100]   who's really good, who I've coached for 10 years,
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:08.620]   I don't have to give this big, long, drawn-out explanation.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.220]   I just have to say, "Hey, move your hand
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.580]   "a little differently," right?
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.020]   Or, "Just do this," right?
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.420]   We don't have to spend any time there.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   So I think that's like something that consumes
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.940]   for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13,
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.620]   we're consuming a massive amount of time there
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.780]   on that teaching, learning phase.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.540]   And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.060]   - But that makes total sense, right?
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.100]   - Yeah.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.520]   - It's funny 'cause when you look at like jiu-jitsu schools,
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.900]   they spend a lot of time in the teaching learning
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.140]   and then the live, it feels like there's not enough drilling.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:42.060]   I like how you draw a distinction there.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:42.900]   - Yeah.
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:45.660]   - 'Cause it feels like you're always starting from scratch.
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:48.840]   Like people have like very crappy short-term memory.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.900]   Like they're not, like the way teaching is done
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:55.060]   is you show a technique from scratch
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:57.080]   and it seems disjoint.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:57.920]   - It is, for sure.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.380]   Especially if you have a class that's been with you
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.360]   for a while, you don't have to start from scratch.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.100]   You can say, "Hey, let's focus on this one little thing here
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.860]   "or after we do this, let's do that."
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:09.260]   You know, and you kind of start putting it all together.
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.700]   And then with jiu-jitsu, the thing that I really struggled
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.020]   with was a couple things.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:17.620]   It was, and this is not speaking for all the jiu-jitsu gyms,
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.900]   my personal experience through the sport.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.900]   And I actually found, so when I unretired,
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.680]   I found someone really great that I loved
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.100]   and I really wish it was Mark Lehman.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.220]   I don't know if you know him at all.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:28.480]   I wish I would have found him earlier
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.980]   'cause he was just tremendous.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.540]   But number one, there's no drilling.
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.820]   So it's like in wrestling, I can boil down to,
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:40.660]   I can probably name you the best six moves, right?
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.580]   So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.280]   Single leg's gonna be the most proficient takedown.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.060]   It always has been, I don't know,
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.460]   probably always will be unless the AI
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.060]   figures out something different.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.340]   - The robot.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.460]   - The robot figures out something different.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.740]   We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.580]   Why?
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.760]   'Cause everyone's gonna do that, right?
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.380]   We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:02.060]   So just like, say, an arm bar or some type of sweep, right?
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.940]   Why can't we go get 50 reps there?
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:06.540]   Hey, by the time I've been in your jiu-jitsu school
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.340]   for two years, I better know a fucking arm bar.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.480]   I better know it.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.340]   So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.940]   Just tell me to go hit 50 reps.
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.660]   And then if when I'm hitting my reps,
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:16.440]   if there's something I'm doing wrong,
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.380]   then just say, "Hey, Ben, move your leg
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.300]   "a little bit that way."
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.820]   Or, "Raise your hips up a little more."
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:23.280]   Right, like correct as you're drilling
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.700]   so you're getting all these reps at it
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.340]   so you're becoming more proficient.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.660]   And then the other thing I really struggled with
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:30.180]   was, to your point, during live,
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.940]   so many times it's just this five minute, go, go.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.260]   Go, and that's not the most efficient way to learn
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.260]   because when you have two people,
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.220]   especially when they're focused on winning,
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.300]   and you say, "Go,"
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:41.940]   they're gonna go to wherever they do best.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:43.620]   Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something,
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.900]   I don't want you doing what you do best all the time.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.820]   I need you doing some other things, right?
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.900]   If you have a great single leg,
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.020]   but you can't shoot to the other side of their body,
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.580]   we need to work on that.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.620]   Right, you need to start shooting the other side.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.500]   - There's some sense that you,
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.780]   it's not like you should be told what to work on,
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.980]   but you should be told to work on the thing
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.380]   that you wanna work on.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.060]   Meaning, 'cause I don't know,
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.220]   maybe you can comment on this,
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.820]   but everybody develops a different game
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:08.860]   as you get better and better.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.700]   There's a set of things you need to be working on.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:12.620]   So I actually have,
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:17.180]   especially when I'm training very seriously,
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:21.140]   I'll have a specific technique that I have in mind,
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:24.960]   and I have a sheet of paper on the side
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.860]   where I literally, in my head, keep counting off
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.340]   how many times I put myself in that position
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.380]   and pulled off the technique.
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.940]   And that's all I care about in training.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.380]   So I'll just, whatever it is,
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.180]   if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine,
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:38.420]   arm drag, arm drag.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:42.140]   But I wanna make sure I don't, I love numbers.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:47.140]   So I'll say, I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags,
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.580]   and I'm not getting off the mat until I do.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.900]   And that, if it takes--
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.100]   - In a thrilling or live contest?
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.380]   - So in the thing I'm describing right now
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.220]   is the live contest.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.060]   - Okay, got it.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.260]   - But drilling, obviously, drilling.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.940]   I can't find a drilling part,
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.020]   like it's so hard to find drilling partners.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.580]   Even-- - So boring.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.900]   - It's annoying to me that this is boring.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.860]   And there's nothing more annoying to me
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.180]   than the look of boredom on another person's face
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:13.340]   when we're drilling.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:14.180]   It's like--
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.580]   - Do you really think drilling's that beneficial to you?
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.100]   'Cause you said it's a job.
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:17.940]   - Yes, yes. - Really?
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:19.140]   - And he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.500]   - Why?
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:23.580]   - Why am I an idiot or why is this drilling beneficial?
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:27.020]   - Well, let's go with two different positions.
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.260]   Why is it so beneficial?
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:34.580]   - I think, for me, there's a meditative aspect to it
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.900]   where the more you drill,
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:41.020]   the more you start noticing the details.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.740]   - Okay, let me push back a little bit here.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:44.860]   I'm not gonna push back all the way,
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.220]   'cause every time, if I was wrestling,
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.700]   I won't have a head-crunch thing, whatever, right?
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.780]   But even, so say at a high level,
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.980]   when I'm really wrestling, say 10 years ago,
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.700]   even during that drill portion,
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.380]   if we talk about the resistance of our opponent
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:03.380]   from zero to 100, it's very likely that my partner,
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:05.380]   at that point, 'cause it's people I'm really comfortable with,
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:07.260]   they're probably at least going 20 or 30, right?
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.700]   They're probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.540]   or I gotta get through their hands.
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:12.940]   If I don't set it up right,
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.780]   they might put their arm down, right?
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.900]   So it's like, we are drilling,
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.380]   'cause we're wrestling at a really low resistance level,
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.620]   but there's a little bit of sparring too.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:22.660]   - Oh yeah, the 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.180]   So that's not all. - So that's not really
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.660]   drilling, 'cause I think of drilling,
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:28.180]   I think literally you're shooting and I'm just, boom,
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.700]   I'm gonna shoot, I'm gonna be your dummy, boom, boom,
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.140]   boom, boom, boom, type of thing.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.860]   - No, but it's very hard to be a dummy
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:36.300]   that doesn't do 20%, so you're gonna do 20%, yeah.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.460]   So yes, that's 20%.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.660]   But-- - So that's like sparring
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.140]   a little bit then.
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.820]   - No, but they're not really resisting,
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.620]   they're just giving you the right frame,
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.340]   they're giving you the right movement,
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.940]   and they're being an intelligent dummy, essentially.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:53.420]   I mean, but also the really important component of this
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:56.340]   is you pick the techniques for which it's beneficial.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.660]   If the technique has dynamic elements to it,
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:02.180]   you don't want to be doing that with,
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.680]   I'm saying there's certain moves,
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.180]   and I like those moves, and I select the game base
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.060]   in those moves that can-- - So are you drilling
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.340]   to get better, or are you drilling just to work out?
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.740]   - No, to get better.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.660]   That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.820]   I believe you can become exceptionally good
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.220]   very fast by drilling.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.060]   - But how?
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:25.460]   - First of all, let me ask you an empirical question.
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.780]   Have you actually drilled 10,000 times
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:30.980]   a particular move? - Absolutely, millions.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.900]   - Millions, you haven't drilled millions.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.700]   - Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.820]   - I think you're just saying numbers.
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.660]   I don't think you know what 100,000--
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.060]   - The number is freaking astronomical,
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:39.980]   it's way more than 10,000.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:41.820]   - I don't think you know what 100,000 feels like.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:42.980]   - Dude, there was a 10-year period
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:46.540]   where I wrestled every single day, that's 3,000 days,
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:48.780]   so you're telling me 10,000, that's only three of them a day.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.740]   I did way more than that.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:51.580]   - Three of them?
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.620]   - Probably 30 of them a day, that's 100,000.
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.100]   - Yeah, 30. - Yeah, hundreds of thousands.
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.580]   - I doubt you did 30 a day for a particular technique.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:01.860]   - I did, for sure, 100%, there's no doubt.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.140]   'Cause some days I might do 100, right?
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.860]   So 30 of 30's not very many,
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.220]   especially if we count all reps,
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:09.340]   if we're counting drilling and live.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.980]   So our college coaches would make us just drill a lot
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.300]   and I always hated it, so I would rebel
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:15.460]   and just kind of give a little spar.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.140]   You shoot a high crotch, we'll start.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.760]   Coach wants to drill a high crotch, okay, we'll start.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.100]   You shoot the high crotch, that's great.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.420]   Then I'm gonna sit the corner, I'm gonna give you my hip,
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.260]   or I'm gonna try something, so then you have to react.
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.420]   And I would argue that all skill level
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:34.020]   past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.220]   I'm gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:37.180]   It's back and forth.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.640]   I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.900]   I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.380]   And you have to start unconsciously programming
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:43.220]   these things in your head,
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.300]   because if you consciously think about it,
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.780]   it's gonna be too slow to actually hit it in math.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.100]   - But the drilling is the unconscious programming.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.240]   - But the simple movement, the first simple movement,
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.280]   the first simple movement, that single leg,
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:55.920]   or the high crotch, or arm drag, whatever,
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.000]   like I feel like the amount you're gonna get better at it
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.620]   is so minuscule compared to the amount you're gonna gain
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.200]   at doing other things around it.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.020]   Do you see what I mean?
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.760]   - No, but that's the key word, you feel.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.600]   - Okay. - That's your opinion.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.160]   - I think if we did a study on it,
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.520]   that I would be proven correct.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.200]   - No, perhaps.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.900]   So first of all, your brain,
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:20.860]   as an exceptionally creative combat athlete,
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:24.540]   it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.900]   Like it's obvious that you have like,
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:28.700]   you're such a creative energy,
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.380]   that you're just not going to be somebody
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.420]   who's going to enjoy that.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.540]   So enjoyment is probably,
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.820]   having an active mind is really important.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.820]   So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:44.700]   that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.080]   And I have that mind.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.720]   Like I can-- - But do you really think,
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.200]   okay, so if you're, let's pick a technique.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.280]   What technique do you wanna drill a lot?
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.800]   - I would do jiu-jitsu or wrestling.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.800]   - Whatever you want.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.440]   - It's hard to describe with words,
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.380]   but certain guard passes.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:03.000]   Let me think, just guard pass.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.920]   - Okay, so you have a guard pass,
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.480]   and you get it to be a, I'd say 9 1/2 out of 10, right?
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.960]   Just from a technical standpoint.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.680]   Don't you think you need some resistance to feel,
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.180]   'cause essentially all benefit after that
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:18.180]   is going to be, what are they gonna try to do to me?
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.380]   And if they shift it that way,
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.620]   do I need to sink here or move there?
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.100]   So it's like, I actually think we're agreeing,
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.180]   but maybe terminology-wise.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.900]   - Well, the split is the important thing,
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.580]   like how much of each.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.020]   - So I think it is spar.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.580]   I think it's a very light touch spar
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.020]   is what you're talking about,
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.420]   which is, in my opinion, really isn't drilling.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:41.500]   And it's 'cause drilling past the basic proficiency,
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.060]   I don't think brings much value.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.260]   - No, but that's what I'm trying to tell you
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:45.820]   is I think it does.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:50.820]   I think if you're doing that same movement,
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.860]   I think you begin to learn more over time.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.700]   Like you're saying once you get the basic proficiency,
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.980]   then there's diminishing returns.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.500]   I don't think so. - Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.340]   - I don't think so.
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.720]   I think everything has diminishing returns
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.260]   when you're learning a technique.
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:09.220]   - But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling,
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.020]   if you can have way more gains over here,
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:16.700]   why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:19.820]   If this other area, if you're spending so much time here
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:21.820]   that there's other areas left unexplored
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.620]   and you can make gigantic gains over there.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:25.220]   - No, but you're gonna lose.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.020]   I think a lot depends on your style.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:33.020]   I think a lot is determined by how good you are at one thing.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.580]   And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.740]   and then make your whole game
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.980]   where it's all pulled into that system,
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:40.820]   then I don't know.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:42.980]   - I think one is too small of a number.
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.380]   - Yeah, it's small.
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:47.900]   I feel like you can't be easily this, like I've--
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:50.140]   - Yeah, you wanna funnel, you wanna create funnels.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.340]   - Funnels. - Funnels, right?
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:52.780]   Where everything goes into a few positions
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:54.580]   where ideally you win 100%. - And then it's all feel.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:55.540]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.540]   - But I feel that you can get like drilling on a dummy
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.100]   80% of the time and 20% of the time
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.640]   live rolling with people worse than you,
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:11.220]   like a little bit worse than you or a lot worse than you.
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:13.260]   - Yeah, so I definitely think,
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:17.820]   so my buildup would be teach,
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:19.460]   so we're talking a complex technique, right?
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.380]   So by the time we're talking about,
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.820]   we'll say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient,
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.700]   he's probably done the drilling part.
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.460]   So then now it's like, okay,
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.300]   if I wanna get something new to you,
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:31.460]   I'll probably tell you,
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:32.860]   you'll probably be able to do the basic premise
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:35.380]   within five to 10 minutes if they're good, right?
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.820]   Do this, okay, they do it.
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.980]   Then it's like, okay, so now here's from here,
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.820]   what are we gonna do?
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.060]   We're gonna go light sparring, so I know you have success
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.500]   'cause I need you to complete the task
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500]   in order to get better at it.
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.540]   That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:47.940]   is they just wanna go to the toughest person.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.400]   But if you go to the toughest person,
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.940]   you're not gonna actually execute on any skills.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:53.060]   You're gonna get a workout, but you're not,
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.700]   and I need you to execute 'cause I need you to get good
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.100]   at this in order to get good at it.
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:57.500]   You have to get all the way through the technique.
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.980]   - Why do you need them to complete,
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.780]   just so they gain confidence in the technique
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.620]   or they go through all the steps of the technique?
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.660]   - They have to feel all the way through.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.660]   Like if I said, learn a high crotch,
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.700]   when you're drilling with stop halfway every time.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:10.620]   But you're not actually gonna be able to do it
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.660]   'cause you're gonna stop, you're not gonna feel.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.220]   So try it on someone, spar lightly, get it.
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.300]   Do it on someone who's not as good, you get it.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.220]   Then kind of work your way up the ladder
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:21.860]   so you can get it on someone your own skill level
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.960]   or maybe better than you in a live competition.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.740]   So it's like, I don't know, I feel like that basic drilling,
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.260]   so a kid like Keegan who I've brought up a few times,
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:32.580]   I feel like if there's something new,
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.860]   I could literally tell him, this is what I want you to do
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.420]   and he has such a great feel,
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:37.900]   he could go drill it proficiently
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:40.160]   within probably a minute or two.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.780]   But then to hit it on someone high level,
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:44.300]   that's gonna take quite a while longer.
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.740]   - And that's a mix of drilling and--
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.580]   - Sparring.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.860]   - Sparring on people a little bit worse than you.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.500]   - Yeah, and then equal and then better.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.540]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:56.300]   - Yeah, because there's this, with grappling,
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.840]   there's such a feel component to the pressure,
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.300]   the movement, all these things.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.540]   And there's still, like I said,
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.180]   there's so many things you can throw at someone
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.860]   out of one position, not just moves,
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:08.580]   but moves at different levels of force or whatever.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.540]   - Are you and these kids developing
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.660]   like a big picture strategy of like,
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:18.700]   what are the main setups and takedowns
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.420]   and just like a whole system?
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:24.260]   - So I kind of sent you our technique book, right,
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.740]   and how we kind of go at, approach it.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:29.520]   So I think in wrestling, you're going to need,
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.820]   you're gonna need a handful of things,
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.980]   just off the word go, right?
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.180]   You're going to, so I think on our feet,
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.780]   I need to be able to take this side of the body,
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:40.860]   I need to be able to take that side of the body,
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:42.860]   I need to be able to bring you underneath me,
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:44.880]   I need to be able to go around you, right?
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.720]   Now we can accomplish those different ways,
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.380]   but we should have all of those weapons,
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:51.140]   if we're gonna be really good some way, right?
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.420]   So if I neglect one of those,
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.780]   so if I neglect the ability to say,
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:56.360]   pull you down, right, if I had locked you,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.460]   now if I have a good shot and you're smart,
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.540]   you're just gonna lower your stance.
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.980]   So my shot is not gonna be as successful,
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.980]   and I have the inability to pull you down, right?
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:06.180]   So I kind of need all of those, so I can,
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:09.220]   as they get better, I can point those things out.
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.180]   On bottom, my focus on bottom, there's certain things,
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:15.580]   like you have to be good at leg right defense, right?
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:17.380]   You have to, I mean, at a high level,
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.360]   or you're just gonna, you're gonna,
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.260]   when you get it in, you're just gonna get stuck there,
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:22.460]   not gonna be able to escape.
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.980]   But besides that, yeah, there's a multitude of things
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.180]   that you can choose from, and I'm gonna,
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:29.340]   depending on your body style,
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.500]   and what you're good and bad at,
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.420]   I'm gonna probably develop something a little different.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.480]   I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:37.140]   you'd be better as a knee slide, whatever.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:40.620]   Yeah, top, kind of same thing.
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.460]   - I have to ask you about Khabib.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.060]   So I remember a while ago,
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:48.780]   Rogan said that that's the perfect fight for Khabib.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.380]   You are.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:52.060]   So let me ask two questions.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:55.620]   The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.340]   when you're at your peak?
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.140]   - I don't like, yeah, I mean,
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:00.740]   this is one of those people where people will get
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.660]   really mad at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean--
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:03.620]   - But how would you do it?
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.300]   How would you solve that puzzle?
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:08.940]   - Yeah, I mean, we would grapple,
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.180]   and I think I would be better than him,
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:12.380]   but I, you know, I feel weird saying this,
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.180]   people are like, yeah, right, you're full of shit,
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:18.080]   you know, and, but that's, no one out grappled him, right?
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.740]   I mean, nobody did, and maybe I'm wrong on this,
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:24.000]   but if we look at the best possible candidates,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.160]   I'm definitely one of them,
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.560]   and obviously I have a small size advantage too.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.020]   - So in a wrestling match,
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:33.060]   so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match,
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:35.300]   what do you think is the right strategy on him?
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:37.220]   Like, do you understand his style,
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:41.100]   his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:44.060]   Do you understand how the hell he makes that happen?
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.940]   - Yeah, I mean, see, he never, unfortunately,
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.780]   fought any real, who I would say,
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:50.500]   really, really high-level wrestlers.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.420]   I was actually really disappointed
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:52.900]   how bad Justin Gaethje's wrestling was,
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:55.720]   'cause Justin Gaethje had some solid success,
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.160]   but his wrestling was really bad in that fight.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.440]   - Gaethje had success in CWA?
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.920]   - Yeah, I think he was seventh place, maybe, or somewhere.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.600]   He was definitely All-American.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.860]   He was lower, though.
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:10.840]   So yeah, I would like to see how he dealt
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.360]   with someone who was like, who I think,
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.480]   oh man, this guy's a really high-level wrestler,
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.600]   'cause, you know, we saw, and this is early in his career,
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.840]   but, you know, Gleason Tebow did give him some issues
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:19.980]   earlier in his career,
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.880]   so I would like to see him in that situation
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:23.720]   and see how he does.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.800]   I would love to, like, you know,
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.240]   I just love wrestling and grappling.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.800]   Like, yeah, I'd love if someone said,
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.680]   hey, Ben, you know, Khabib wants to roll with you.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.120]   I go, okay, I'm there tomorrow.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.000]   It sounds like a blast.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.040]   Let's go.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.980]   - He's probably competitive as hell.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.820]   - Yeah.
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.040]   - You're still competitive?
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.520]   - I know when to be and when not to be.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.920]   Like, you know, say if I'm going to high school,
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.160]   kids are not gonna be competitive,
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:45.760]   'cause then I'm just being a dick.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.260]   - How would you take him down?
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:49.920]   - What, what were we talking about, real wrestlers?
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.360]   - Wrestling wrestlers? - Wrestling wrestlers.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.720]   - I would probably try to take single legs and stuff.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.880]   - Single legs? - Yeah.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.880]   - I haven't, okay.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:58.560]   Not, not--
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.080]   - No, I'd, honestly, I don't have the slightest clue.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   I'd have to feel, I'd feel him out,
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.240]   but single legs is my best take down.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.720]   - People talk about his wrestling being really good.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.620]   - Yeah. - The people that train
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:08.840]   with him. - So, okay,
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.120]   so I grilled someone, I will not say who,
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.680]   on the Ed Ruth thing, 'cause Ed Ruth is very elite
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:15.560]   and focused on wrestling.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.760]   He never became that great at fighting, unfortunately.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.760]   - Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Khabib?
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.960]   - They were on the same team for a while, yeah.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.000]   - Okay. - And there was rumors
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.760]   that Khabib beat him up, and I said,
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.120]   I sure can't believe that.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.500]   And I've heard that that was,
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.840]   if they were just straight wrestling,
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:33.040]   Ed would get slightly the better of it.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.160]   - Well, Ed Ruth is like one of the greats.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:38.000]   - He's great. - He's really good, yeah.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.320]   So that was what I heard, but in an MMA setting,
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.960]   because of all the tools that Khabib would get him.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:46.360]   - I don't know.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.760]   - Well, but I agree, I agree with Rogan on this one.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.720]   That would have been good to see.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.560]   - Yeah, that would have been fun.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.840]   So yeah, if Khabib wants to work out, I'd love it.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.240]   I love wrestling and grappling.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.080]   I don't do much jujitsu,
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.600]   'cause I just don't have time for it anymore.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.280]   I'm at the Wrestling Academy every single day.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.560]   But I love jujitsu, I did it,
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.480]   and if I didn't have Wrestling Academy,
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.960]   I probably would still be doing jujitsu.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.040]   - Yeah, you do well in jiu-jitsu as well.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.120]   But let me ask you a ridiculous question.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.040]   Who's the greatest of all time, freestyle or folk style?
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.640]   - Oh, wrestling. - Wrestling.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.080]   - Well, I will say my knowledge past the year 2000
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.600]   is really not that great, 'cause you can't--
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.560]   - In which direction, sorry, after 2000?
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.080]   - No, no, before, 'cause you can't find any film
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.240]   or anything, you know, and so you hear of all these--
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.320]   - So you need evidence, you need direct evidence?
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.000]   - I wanna be able to watch 'em and see 'em
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.720]   and feel the times and feel their opponents
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.960]   and all those things to really,
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.920]   I hate giving bad answers, you know?
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:44.800]   There's just not enough footage of any of those people.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.760]   You know, we go back to someone like Alexander Medved.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.960]   Like, you can't find footage,
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.360]   you can't find anything on him, you know?
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.240]   So like, who is he wrestling?
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.200]   You know, I'm not sure.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:58.200]   So, post-2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle, so--
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:01.760]   - Americans, Russians?
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.720]   - Seteev has probably the best argument post-2000.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.440]   I think Sadyulayev, if he could--
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:07.440]   - Yeah, the Russian tank.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:08.960]   - Pete Snyder. - Pete Snyder, yeah.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.440]   So who's better, Snyder or Sadyulayev?
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.840]   - So Sadyulayev just won at the Olympics.
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.700]   - Now, I understand this, I understand how that works,
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:16.960]   but it's pretty close, right?
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960]   - Not really.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.880]   - Not that match, but in general, the matchup.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.800]   - So, well, so Kyle won the first one in '17.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.840]   Sadyulayev pinned him the following year,
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.520]   but then Kyle lost and took bronze in '19,
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.500]   and then just lost.
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.120]   I don't wanna say fairly decisively,
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.200]   but it was six to three, and there was a late takedown.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.440]   He kinda gave it up, and maybe,
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.000]   if it was really competitive, maybe he wouldn't have.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.240]   They're gonna wrestle again in like two weeks here.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.140]   So, yeah, you have to say Sadyulayev at this point.
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.500]   There's nothing else to say
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.820]   unless Kyle proves this otherwise.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.740]   - Yeah, not enough people talk about Sadyulayev.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.580]   Okay, well, you think that guy should go to MMA?
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.140]   You think Kyle should go to MMA?
[01:45:59.140 --> 01:45:59.980]   Some of these guys.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:01.660]   - Yeah, they're making enough money in wrestling
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:03.220]   where they don't really feel the need to.
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.340]   It's great. - It's terrifying, though.
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:06.940]   As a heavyweight, Sadyulayev would probably,
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:09.340]   it's like Khabib, but heavyweight.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.180]   - Well, I don't know if you remember,
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.460]   do you remember Bilal Mokhov?
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:14.960]   So, Bilal Mokhov actually was the Russian representative
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.800]   in both styles in 2016, grappling and freestyle.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:20.920]   And he was, to my knowledge,
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.720]   the only person the UFC's ever signed
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.960]   that was zero, in modern era, signed that was zero and zero,
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.320]   and then he actually never ended up fighting.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.720]   But weird, right?
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.120]   So, yeah. - No motivation.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.800]   - I don't know what the story is.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.120]   'Cause sometimes out of Russia,
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.000]   I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do,
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.880]   sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear.
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.680]   Like they're a world champ or an Olympic champ,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.200]   and then all of a sudden you're like, wait.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.740]   I don't know, where'd he go?
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.300]   - You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation.
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.460]   - Oh, what'd I say?
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.380]   - I forgot, but I think--
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.220]   - Steroids.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.780]   - I think somebody's gonna show up to your door.
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.620]   - I'm worried.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.060]   Honestly, I've said enough bad things
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:56.060]   where I would be kind of looking over my shoulder
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.380]   if I went to the bathroom or something.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.220]   (laughing)
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:01.260]   - I, for one, love the Russians.
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:03.000]   - What about Icarus?
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:03.840]   How does that make you feel?
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.680]   - What about it?
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:05.500]   It's fake news.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.340]   - Oh, really?
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:07.160]   - I'm just kidding.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.000]   - It's propaganda?
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:08.840]   Maybe it is.
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.380]   I don't know, I don't know what it is anymore.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.220]   - Yeah.
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.040]   (laughing)
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.040]   You know, it's troublesome, man.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.080]   I hate cheating in all of its forms.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.840]   Any other recaps from the Olympics of 2020,
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.120]   Tokyo, that stood out to you?
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:21.960]   Gable Stevenson, anything like that?
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.400]   - Gable's great, yeah.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.800]   No, I think America's coming to the point
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.000]   where we're gonna compete with Russia
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000]   every single year in wrestling,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.920]   which obviously, long, long time ago,
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.240]   many, many years, we were great,
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.520]   and then kind of after that Soviet Union period,
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.820]   I think there was a lot of poverty in that area,
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:43.540]   and that kind of led the wrestling team
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.820]   going down a little bit,
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:47.620]   and then obviously, a lot of those regions,
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:50.580]   the way they found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea,
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:53.380]   I believe, and they've been really kind of
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:54.860]   on the upswing for the last 20 years,
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:58.020]   and now America, really, since 2012,
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.340]   has been on the upswing in wrestling,
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:02.780]   and we're kind of really competing with them,
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.900]   and they're not sending a couple of their best guys.
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.860]   So for those who don't know,
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:08.580]   the Olympics got put back in the air,
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:11.320]   so they are hosting the 2021 World Championships,
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.800]   despite the fact that we just had the Olympics
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.340]   two months ago, so it's happening next week
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.640]   in Oslo, Norway.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.280]   So Russia's not sending their number one at 57
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.700]   and their number one at 65,
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:23.520]   so it's like America's probably gonna win, I think.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.960]   I don't wanna guarantee anything,
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.640]   but there's a really good chance of it.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:29.000]   - If Dave Taylor, all those guys competing.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.620]   - America gave any of the Olympians that medaled
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.440]   the opportunity to not even have to wrestle off,
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.520]   they just gotta keep the spots
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.640]   since it was two months later if they medaled,
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.860]   so the only one who's not is Gable.
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:40.020]   Gable's moving on.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.460]   We have a pretty good guy behind him,
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.180]   named Nicholas Dalski, who's a world medalist,
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:47.180]   but then he's a Burlesfield in the 79 spot,
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.140]   Jayden Coxfield in the 92 spot,
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:52.020]   who's a world champion also, so we have--
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:52.980]   - It's a hell of a team.
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:54.340]   - Pretty good squad, yeah.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.180]   - Pretty good squad.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:56.460]   - Pretty happy.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:59.420]   - So given your run in Bellator in one championship,
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:03.060]   that was one of the most dominant runs in MMA,
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:06.340]   what would you say was key to your dominance,
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:08.380]   and that long, undefeated streak?
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:12.220]   - Probably consistency would be one.
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:16.620]   The fact that I lived and trained the same way
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.960]   no matter where my life was, whereas a lot of fighters,
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.940]   once they start making money for the first time,
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.900]   they have all these obligations, and they travel,
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.760]   and they really enjoy making money,
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.980]   and that's kind of why some of them fall off.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:29.980]   - So you had the same process, the same camp.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:32.940]   - Yeah, I stayed at my house, I didn't vacation,
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:35.500]   yeah, everything, just, you know.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.500]   And so that was a big part of it.
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.260]   Obviously, the style thing is like, no one could,
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:43.300]   there was only a few people who could stop my style,
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:46.820]   and I think I continued to get better
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:51.820]   as a mixed martial artist, and I wasn't as innovative
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:55.340]   in mixed martial arts, but there was a handful of things
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:58.300]   that I innovated, specifically in the top position,
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:00.900]   where I spent a lot of time, where it was just like,
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:02.820]   there was just, once I got on top of you,
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.660]   it was like in a spider web, and there was just
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.220]   kind of no way out, you know, you never felt
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:10.020]   the certain things I was doing, and so people just,
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.980]   they gave up eventually.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.860]   - How's the level of wrestling in MMA, would you say?
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:19.580]   So, I saw somewhere like champions,
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:22.820]   the most popular martial art for current UFC champions
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.420]   are all wrestling.
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:27.180]   - So we just lost a bunch of the belts.
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:29.420]   Wrestling, as a sport, right?
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:32.140]   But yeah, one point we had, I think it was eight of nine,
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.700]   maybe, or something to that effect.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:36.900]   And I think it's not just wrestling,
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:39.740]   not just the actual martial art of wrestling
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:44.200]   that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts,
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.580]   but other things like the way we're systemized,
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:49.100]   so most kids who have, let's say, have went through
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.700]   the high school program and the college program,
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.900]   and they know how to show up on time,
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:54.900]   and they know how to work hard, so when they go to ATT,
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:58.060]   or AKA, or wherever, they know how to show up on time,
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:58.900]   and they know how to work hard,
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.720]   and that's gonna get you a really long way.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.940]   Just those two things, right?
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.900]   - Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:04.740]   - Those things.
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.100]   Then I think you throw on top of that the fact
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:10.140]   that most of us have competed 1,500 to 2,000 times,
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:12.300]   probably by the time we get to 20-something,
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.500]   like that's a huge advantage, too.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.460]   Most of these other people from other disciplines
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:18.220]   maybe have competed 100, if that, right?
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.300]   So we have this competitive process down
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:23.140]   really, really, really, really well.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.100]   - Plus the weight cut.
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:24.940]   - The weight cut.
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.380]   There's all these things, right, that factor into it.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.140]   I think the fact that we're really open-minded,
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.980]   like I think if you would, I don't wanna pick on jujitsu
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:34.980]   again, but how many jujitsu guys have became
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:36.420]   highly proficient in wrestling,
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:38.060]   versus how many wrestling guys have became
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:39.860]   highly proficient in jujitsu?
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.940]   I think that number swings one way,
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:43.820]   and not that much the other way.
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:48.260]   We're open to adapting and learning,
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:52.000]   and for some reason, jujitsu people,
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.980]   how many of them have got high-level wrestling?
[01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:57.420]   Or even mediocre wrestling, the number's really small.
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:52:00.020]   They refuse to, it's really frustrating.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:03.140]   Why won't they do this is obviously a part of it.
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:04.580]   I don't pick on specific guys,
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:06.180]   but there's certain guys in the history of MMA
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:08.620]   where you're like, listen, man.
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:10.740]   I mean, Damian Maia, who was my last fight,
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.400]   is a great example of somebody who actually
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.060]   did get proficient wrestling, right?
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.740]   But there's some of these jujitsu guys who's like,
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:18.660]   if you just got on top, you would submit him.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:20.500]   Why can't you learn a freaking takedown?
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.740]   Like, holy moly, just learn how to take someone down.
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:26.080]   Once you get them down, they will not get up,
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:26.920]   and you win the fight.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.380]   Like, it's so easy, you know?
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:29.300]   But they refuse.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.520]   - How complicated is that journey?
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.460]   So like Donna, I heard that you mentioned, Craig Jones,
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:36.820]   they're big on wrestling as part of jujitsu now.
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:38.840]   Like wrestling, not just on the feet,
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:41.220]   but wrestling from the bottom coming up,
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.940]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:46.440]   So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say,
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.680]   for a jujitsu person to learn?
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:50.780]   - Not that hard, if they really put their mind to it.
[01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.660]   'Cause they already, like, when you grapple,
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:54.340]   and this is any grappling art,
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:56.820]   there's a certain part of it that you kind of get,
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:59.340]   and it can, might not be the exact same thing,
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.780]   but you understand how your body moves,
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:02.100]   and how to feel certain pressures,
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:04.960]   and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:07.420]   So I don't think, I think there's just a certain level
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:09.600]   of stubbornness where they didn't wanna,
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.660]   certain people didn't wanna do it for whatever reason.
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:15.180]   I think a lot of times in MMA, it's the,
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:17.500]   I'm so macho, I can stand and bang thing,
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:18.860]   you know, where they wanna, you know,
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.020]   show how macho they are.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:24.020]   But yeah, that was a frustrating one, that they,
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.380]   there's a lot of wrestlers who've became
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:28.460]   highly proficient in jujitsu, and really adapted,
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:29.580]   and it doesn't go the other way.
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:31.860]   And then I guess the other thing there too is,
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:35.100]   they can both steal from each other, right?
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.780]   As any martial art can steal from another,
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:41.140]   and like, I feel like jujitsu didn't do enough
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:42.260]   stealing from wrestling.
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.060]   Like, they should have looked at all the wrestling possibilities
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:47.060]   and said, "Well, why don't we steal that, and that,
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:48.980]   and that, you know, and like, hey, let's take that over,
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.300]   and maybe we'd make a little tweak,
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.300]   because it's different,
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.900]   but there's something we can definitely use there."
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:57.220]   So like, in wrestling, for example,
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:59.660]   you know there's a one-arm guillotine in jujitsu, right?
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.100]   Okay, so there's a move called,
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:01.940]   well, it's got a hard name,
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.060]   it's like the oldest move in wrestling,
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.140]   'cause it's what they did, the cows,
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:04.980]   where they go around the chin,
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:06.260]   and they throw them on their back.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:07.420]   I don't know what you call that one.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:08.940]   - I don't know. - Okay.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:11.220]   - Sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.060]   - Yeah.
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.540]   - When you take a cow, and grab it by the neck,
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.380]   and throw it to the side.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:17.340]   - No, but in wrestling, in wrestling.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.380]   - I don't know.
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:19.220]   - Okay, we call it--
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.300]   - Are you putting it under, like, while you're hooking up?
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.660]   - Yeah, so you grab their chin,
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:22.820]   and then you go under their arm,
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:23.700]   and then throw them on their back.
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.700]   - Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah.
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.460]   - Yeah, so we call that the honey badger,
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:27.820]   but it's got-- - Honey badger.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.900]   - Different names, wherever you go,
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:30.140]   it's got different names.
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:33.980]   So I would always, I would say, like,
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:36.140]   pre-jujitsu, I was average at it.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:38.220]   Like, I could do it, but against good people,
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.140]   you'd never get it for, because,
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:41.780]   oh, I'll tell you what, 'cause they would get
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:43.180]   the back of their head up, and they were too strong,
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:44.140]   where you couldn't collapse them
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:45.180]   by going over their neck, right?
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:46.660]   Because the forces weren't right.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.700]   So then in jujitsu, you learn the one-arm guillotine,
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:50.580]   where you grab their chin, and this is more
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:52.260]   of running along the side of their head,
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:54.780]   and then you go here, and you choke them, right?
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:58.060]   Much more efficient way to move their head,
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:00.220]   because the fulcrum is way down here,
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:02.940]   and their head can move into that, right?
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:06.300]   So once I learned that in jujitsu, I'm like, wait,
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:07.860]   I can do this in wrestling.
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.100]   So now, once I learned how to grab their chin the right way,
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.540]   and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out.
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:14.700]   I just had to steal that jujitsu,
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:16.540]   put it in wrestling, and boom, there we go.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:18.780]   - But very few people steal any direction.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.940]   That takes creativity.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:21.180]   - Really? - And open-mindedness.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.380]   - It's so easy, 'cause it's already done.
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:23.780]   You just gotta steal it.
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.900]   - I mean, same with judo.
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:27.180]   If you're a gi jujitsu person,
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:32.180]   there's so much stuff in judo that's ripe for the stealing,
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:37.700]   because judo is much more, emphasizes explosive moves
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:42.300]   on the transition, which is something jujitsu does not do.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.780]   Because you have so-- - You mean from the take down
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:44.860]   to-- - From the take down,
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.700]   but also just in general, just in the transition,
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:52.700]   the concept of transition, jujitsu's very much about
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:54.780]   we're in this position, then we're in this position,
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.740]   then we're in this position.
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.740]   The judo is much more in when there's chaos of any kind.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.460]   That's when you need to strike.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:06.740]   And to learn that, I mean, that's why people
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:08.020]   like Travis Stevens and Jidoka,
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:10.540]   when they go to jujitsu, they can dominate.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:13.700]   But jujitsu people should steal that.
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:14.900]   - It's too stubborn.
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:17.500]   - Yeah, but so is every, wrestlers are stubborn too.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:18.340]   - No way.
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.180]   (laughing)
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:21.180]   There would never be any stubborn wrestlers.
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:23.220]   - Well, I mean, I was surprised,
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:26.700]   all these coaches, John Smith, Dan Gable,
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:29.700]   they don't really have interest in MMA or jujitsu and so on.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:31.380]   - They don't really.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.100]   - But you would think somebody like a John Smith
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:36.740]   would put on a white belt and roll around.
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:39.420]   - Yeah, I think he's just too focused on--
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.260]   - Well, he's a coach.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:41.700]   - But he's a coach and what he's doing.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.220]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's younger
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:46.060]   he would have a lot of fun.
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:47.100]   We actually have a really good wrestler
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.900]   making his MMA debut tomorrow.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.900]   I don't know if you, Bo Nickel,
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:51.180]   I'm sure you've heard of him.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:54.500]   Third high level, I think he's gonna have a lot of success.
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.460]   - I mean, some people might say that like,
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:01.380]   jujitsu makes you a little comfortable being in your back.
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.860]   And for a wrestler that could be like really bad.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:05.020]   - I hate that take.
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:07.260]   - Yeah, but that's the Dan Gable take.
[01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:09.780]   - It's so stupid, it's so stupid.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:12.140]   For God's sakes, we know the fucking rules.
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:13.780]   Just wrestling, you don't go to your back.
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:16.260]   In jujitsu you can, it's like whatever.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.100]   - Yeah.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.740]   - But like, so jujitsu for example.
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.300]   So I coached, when I was at Rufus,
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.820]   I coached the wrestling for a long time,
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:25.820]   three, four, five years.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.100]   So I've been taking a jujitsu guy
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:29.820]   and teaching them a wrestling technique
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:32.460]   where you needed to use your feet.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:35.460]   To teach a jujitsu guy, so easy, so simple.
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:37.100]   'Cause they already understand the concept,
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:39.420]   butterfly guard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:42.540]   To take a wrestler who's never done any of it
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.900]   and teach him how to use his feet,
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:46.260]   oh my God, he's such a beast, it's so hard.
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:49.060]   'Cause that's not a weapon they're thinking about using.
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:51.580]   So it's like, we understand the rules.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:52.900]   It's like freestyle folks are wrestling,
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:55.140]   a freestyle form on the mat, I can lock my hands.
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.700]   You don't see people locking their hands all the time
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.180]   in folk style just 'cause they did freestyle.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.820]   It's like, they get it, there's a rule, they understand it.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.020]   So the notion that somebody could come from on your back.
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:08.660]   - But pinning, that's like, it has a special meaning.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:11.380]   - Yeah, I actually think, so jujitsu,
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:16.380]   you don't actually wanna be flat, flat very often.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.780]   - I always wondered this
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:21.940]   because I did a couple of cat wrestling tournaments
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:26.260]   and I would put myself in butterfly guard
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:28.420]   and I wasn't going against good people.
[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:30.340]   So which is why I was doing all these things.
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:34.420]   But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.180]   where you're butterfly guard.
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:40.220]   - So I think that there's a few places where I use it.
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:41.900]   But so specifically the elevator series,
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:45.380]   which my main series at bottom, it's not butterfly guard.
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.220]   It's a butterfly guard, like grip with your foot.
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.820]   So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot,
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:53.020]   boom and I elevate you over, right?
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.820]   And then also sometimes,
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:57.740]   I think Keegan does this too from watching me,
[01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:01.980]   but if I get double leg, sometimes if I'm accepting,
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:03.420]   so freestyle, obviously you're gonna give a point
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:05.620]   to me in folk style, accepting that you've already got me.
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.500]   And as I go down, I'm just gonna butterfly guard you up,
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.620]   and then I'm gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:13.620]   and get end up in a wizard position.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.340]   Like I've used that quite a few times
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.740]   where it's kind of like a bailout mechanism
[01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:20.540]   that gets me back to maybe not a great position,
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.540]   but obviously much better than being taken down.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.860]   - Beautiful.
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.940]   Let me ask you quickly about crypto
[01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:29.540]   'cause you're also, you have a show,
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:33.780]   you have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency.
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:36.380]   Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:38.060]   Is it just a financial investment
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.860]   or is there a philosophy that attracts you to it?
[01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:44.260]   - So my friend told me about it in 2017.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:47.620]   I was actually, I went to, my friend met me in Shanghai.
[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:50.820]   I fought in one championship and he told me,
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:54.060]   and the second he told me, I'm like, oh, I'm so in.
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:56.580]   'Cause I had read Ron Paul and the Fed.
[01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:01.580]   I had read, I had an understanding how the Fed is unfair.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.420]   And so when he told me about crypto,
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:07.500]   this decentralized system that no one has control over,
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.580]   it just made sense.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:09.980]   And so like we've had, you have the podcast
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.140]   with Tim Michael Saylor on it.
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:11.980]   And I love the way he said it.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:13.620]   It's like, who do you trust more with your money?
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:16.820]   Do you trust the politicians or do you trust engineers?
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:18.260]   I think that's an easy choice.
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.660]   I don't even think, I don't even think
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:20.500]   I have to think about that.
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:21.860]   I don't trust politicians,
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:23.260]   no matter what country they come from,
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:25.620]   China, America, wherever, I don't trust them.
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:31.620]   - So what about in 2017, what was it, Bitcoin?
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.340]   Bitcoin, are you, what do you find,
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.260]   which ones do you find interesting?
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:39.100]   - Yeah.
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:39.920]   - There's all kinds of ideas.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:44.660]   So there's the more sort of primal mechanism
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:46.660]   of proof of work and Bitcoin.
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:48.740]   And then there's smart contracts, ideas,
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:52.020]   and there's all kinds of innovations across the different.
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:55.180]   - So I can't say I'm in super deep
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.060]   where I understand the technical components
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:57.900]   of a lot of them.
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:00:59.420]   I understand what Bitcoin can do for people.
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:01.100]   And so that's probably the one I focus
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.100]   the most on.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:05.620]   And I actually, I think I was talking about,
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:07.700]   I was trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.940]   'cause he hates it also, the way he did it last night.
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:13.900]   And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves,
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.780]   people in America are so American-centric,
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:16.600]   they don't understand it.
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:18.340]   So like high levels of inflation,
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.260]   that hasn't happened in, well, it's started to happen,
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:21.780]   it hasn't happened in America in a long time, right?
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:25.100]   But someone in Venezuela is like, oh, I get that,
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:27.900]   you know, or remittance payments, right?
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:30.380]   Remittance payments to, you see it.
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:32.940]   So I saw this in, when I was spending all the time
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:34.820]   in Singapore, Singapore is obviously
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.540]   a really wealthy country.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:39.020]   And so you'd have Indonesian workers or Filipino workers,
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:40.900]   and they would all go on Sundays,
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:42.620]   they would go to these places to ship stuff
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:44.980]   back to their families and through Western Union.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:46.860]   Western Union gouges the shit out of these people.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.060]   I mean, they're taking 8, 10, 12%
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:50.580]   of whatever they're sending.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:52.920]   Then it takes five days and the person's gonna pick it up.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.660]   Whereas Bitcoin, I could send you Bitcoin
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:56.740]   person to person, right?
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.060]   So like American people don't understand that.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.300]   American people don't really understand,
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:01.340]   the unbanked, right?
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.260]   A decent portion of the world is unbanked,
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.620]   they don't have access to it.
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:07.580]   And a much, much, much smaller portion of the world
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.740]   doesn't have access to internet.
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:11.700]   So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone,
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:13.980]   and we can send money person to person.
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.020]   So there's a whole bunch of those problems
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.740]   where Americans don't really think about
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:19.100]   that are really obvious that this solves.
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.440]   So I think that's the key one.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.380]   Obviously the fact that the value goes up
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:25.860]   is really outstanding also.
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:29.780]   But if you look at it, I got in in 2017.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:31.820]   So I got to watch it go up.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:34.140]   I didn't sell shit at the top, really stupid.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:35.740]   And then the majority of my time
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:37.500]   was spent through the bear market.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:39.900]   And so I had to love it for the principles that it provided,
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.180]   not the fact that actually I actually lost money
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:44.020]   in the beginning and now I'm way up.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.320]   Yeah, so I--
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.220]   And you're just holding.
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:48.300]   You're just holding.
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:50.220]   I think at the top of this bull market,
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:52.840]   I'll probably sell a very small portion.
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:56.060]   You mean like right now there's a bull market?
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:59.060]   Yeah, most people think say in the next three to six months
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:00.820]   we'll be at the top of the market.
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:02.620]   And so probably when that happens,
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:04.780]   I'll probably sell a little bit.
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:06.340]   You gotta hodl it, Ben.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:07.660]   You gotta hodl, well, yeah.
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:12.660]   So one of my podcast co-hosts, he's like super rich,
[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:13.860]   like uber rich.
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:16.140]   So he has lost touch with the everyman.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:17.380]   So here's my argument to him.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:18.660]   It's really simple.
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:20.980]   And listen, I'm doing well for myself in life,
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:24.480]   but if, say, someone buys a Bitcoin, right?
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:27.080]   One Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last year.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:31.900]   And this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000,
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:34.260]   which is right around what a lot of people think
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.620]   the peak is going to be.
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:36.900]   They bought one Bitcoin.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:39.660]   And they're living in a $200,000 house.
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:42.380]   So to take half of that, right?
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.220]   You started at $5,000 of Bitcoin.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:47.420]   To sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:49.780]   and pay off your house, your remaining house payment,
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.140]   that's life-changing to someone.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.100]   It really is.
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:53.740]   And so you still have a Bitcoin.
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:54.920]   So if Bitcoin goes to a million,
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:56.580]   you're still gonna have half a million.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:58.140]   And you're gonna feel really, really rich
[02:03:58.140 --> 02:03:59.140]   with that half a million dollars
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:02.380]   'cause you bought it for $2,500, you know?
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:03.200]   - Yeah. - So yeah.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.140]   So I would encourage anyone who's not uber-rich
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:08.940]   to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of 'em
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:10.640]   because it could change your life.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.780]   - And if you hold it and it goes down,
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.300]   you're going to feel the pain of that.
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:19.820]   Like sometimes if you're more constrained financially,
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:21.500]   it's much more psychologically difficult
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:22.980]   to ride the ups and downs.
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:23.820]   - Yeah, it is, for sure.
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:25.900]   So they have these really fascinating things.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:27.700]   And Bitcoin, actually we said the guy,
[02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:30.020]   one of the main guys on our podcast,
[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.580]   it's called Onchainmetrics.
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:34.900]   So all wallet transactions are visible, you know?
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.420]   And so they have all these fun categories.
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:39.820]   So I actually, I think you said you don't like numbers, but.
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:40.660]   - I like numbers. - Oh, you love numbers.
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.780]   - I love numbers. - So I love numbers also.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.180]   So they have all these different categories.
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:49.180]   Like you can see how long a wallet has held a Bitcoin, right?
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:51.660]   Or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet.
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:54.180]   And so what they've seen during the downturn, right?
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.700]   So April, it kind of peaked and went down,
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:58.980]   is that the whales are still buying.
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:01.860]   So whales, people have a thousand or more are still buying.
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:04.040]   They've said the main group of sellers
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:06.340]   is the ones who held it from zero to three months.
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:07.740]   So like they don't have money,
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.420]   they bought it 'cause they thought it was going up.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:11.620]   And now they're like, oh shit, I gotta sell it, right?
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:13.300]   Whereas anyone's held for a long time
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:15.420]   is generally still holding on to it.
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:16.260]   - That's interesting.
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:17.820]   That's a good indicator, right?
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:19.180]   For the whole space.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:20.020]   - Yeah.
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:21.780]   - Well, let me ask you for some advice.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.160]   You've been through one heck of a career,
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:25.560]   one heck of a life.
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.580]   What advice would you give to a young person today?
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:31.760]   - Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling's really
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:33.820]   a microcosm of what your life's gonna be.
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:35.620]   And that's why one of the things that I stress to kids
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:38.140]   is like, if we can go through this now and figure,
[02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:39.540]   I have a couple kids who are struggling
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.380]   with certain things right now.
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.860]   If you can figure it out this now in wrestling,
[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:44.220]   it's gonna be a lot better to figure it out now
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.420]   and get over this mental hump than when you're 32
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:50.940]   and you have two kids and your job's not going well.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.780]   It's gonna be a lot worse,
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.860]   it's gonna be a lot more painful then.
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:54.780]   Let's fucking figure it out now.
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.340]   So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:57.400]   we can learn from wrestling,
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:00.720]   whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic,
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:02.360]   or you know, I said wrestlers show up on time
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:03.660]   and they work hard, right?
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.940]   These things, if we can learn these things at an early age,
[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:09.880]   those characteristics will generally carry on
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:10.780]   throughout our life.
[02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.840]   And those are the things that are gonna make us
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:12.680]   really successful.
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:15.880]   So I would say find a great coach,
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:17.120]   someone who's gonna spend a lot of time
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:18.100]   and put a lot of time into you
[02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:19.460]   and make sure they have a lot of wisdom
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:22.460]   and steal all the wisdom that you can from them.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.660]   And then if you can be successful at one thing,
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.500]   generally whatever that recipe was
[02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:29.820]   that took you to be successful at that,
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.740]   apply it to everything else, right?
[02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:32.720]   Apply it to the rest of your life,
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:36.020]   apply it to getting a wife that you enjoy,
[02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:38.620]   apply it to living at a place you wanna live,
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.420]   doing a job you wanna do, right?
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.420]   There's so many possibilities
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.300]   and you just have to be bold enough
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:45.420]   to go take those chances.
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.540]   - It's interesting 'cause like early on in life
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.660]   is when you have much more time.
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.220]   Like people don't realize this,
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:53.060]   time to learn the lessons.
[02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:55.660]   Like somehow later in life,
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:58.620]   you get busier responsibilities and all that kind of stuff.
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.260]   Like high school is a magical time,
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:01.860]   even college. - College, yeah.
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:04.620]   - Yeah, there's so much time.
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.820]   - Right? - To learn.
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:07.180]   - But you don't have kids yet.
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:08.020]   - Yeah, I don't have kids.
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.500]   But that still fills up.
[02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:10.860]   Well, no, I'm purpose.
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.820]   And I did something that many people
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:13.860]   don't seem to be able to do.
[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:15.860]   I walked away from a lot of responsibilities
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:18.780]   just by saying goodbye.
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.220]   - Oh, okay.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:23.340]   - But meetings, like everybody around me at MIT
[02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.780]   was like meetings fill the day.
[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:27.500]   And then you have more projects
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:30.420]   and you do a great job and you become successful.
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:32.060]   And then the more meetings fill the day
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:35.420]   and more responsibilities as opposed to like,
[02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:38.940]   wait a minute, do I wanna be involved in all these things?
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:42.540]   And instead, do I wanna find one or two things
[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.980]   to really focus on?
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:46.020]   And that's what I choose.
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:49.420]   But that becomes harder and harder and harder
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:50.380]   as you get older.
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:51.860]   - No, I mean, I'm sure.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:53.580]   And also the more success you have,
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.060]   you become sought after other places too.
[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:57.460]   I'm sure that's happening with you.
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:00.100]   - And it's hard to keep saying no, no, no.
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.340]   - It is, saying no is hard.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.020]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.220]   - You're known for roasting people with a single--
[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:06.820]   (laughing)
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:08.700]   With a single boom, roasted line.
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:11.460]   So any ideas, maybe you wanna mention malice,
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:14.980]   but any ideas come to mind when you look at me?
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:17.380]   - Man, you know what?
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:19.100]   If I was gonna boom roast someone,
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.260]   I would wanna kind of like research their career
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.180]   and dissect them and figure out their biggest negative.
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:24.140]   - Get to the core.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:25.940]   - And I didn't have that notion with you.
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:28.340]   I figured, I got a general sense of,
[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:30.700]   okay, he's really successful, he's super sharp.
[02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.820]   He's really interested in some really interesting things.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:34.220]   I bet we'll have a great conversation,
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:36.860]   but I had no intention to roast you.
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:37.700]   - Yeah, there you go.
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:38.540]   What about malice?
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:39.780]   You had dinner with him last night.
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:40.900]   - Hmm, for him.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:42.220]   (laughing)
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:43.320]   Oh man.
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.380]   - How'd you get to know him, by the way?
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:47.220]   - Twitter.
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:48.040]   - Just Twitter.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:49.620]   - Twitter's the most magical place in the world, right?
[02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:51.380]   I always tell people it's the greatest source of information
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:52.620]   if you know how to use it.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:54.900]   Hmm.
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:56.540]   - He's insane on Twitter, actually.
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:57.380]   He's quite a lot of people.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:58.660]   - So I had to unfollow him on Twitter,
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:08:59.500]   'cause he--
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:00.340]   - It was too intense?
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:01.220]   - It was just too much, no, it was too much.
[02:09:01.220 --> 02:09:03.620]   It fills up, like, I wanna be able to consume the content.
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:04.780]   So if I wanna see something he says,
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:06.900]   I can go to his page, right?
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:08.640]   But it's just too much for my timeline.
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.860]   I want to be able to consume who I follow,
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:12.220]   so I try to not follow a lot of people,
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.840]   'cause I wanna be able to consume them.
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:16.040]   And he was too much.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.680]   He fights the trolls, which,
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.360]   I don't know why you would ever fight the trolls.
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:21.680]   There's just too many of them.
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:22.800]   - Well, he's the troll himself.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.600]   He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.160]   He's the king troll.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:28.960]   - There's a million of 'em, so even if you kill,
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.440]   if you kill 100,000, there's still 100,000 left.
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:32.280]   - Yeah, they just keep following.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.120]   - Oh, you just gotta ignore 'em.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:35.120]   - It's like the Nightwalker or whatever.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:36.460]   - Yeah.
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:39.280]   - Well, I'll take it, 'cause you had nothing,
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.960]   you couldn't roast GSP out of respect, too, so.
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:42.800]   - Yeah.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:43.620]   - I'm just gonna take that as a sign of respect.
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:45.760]   - What do you say bad about GSP?
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:47.000]   Now I try to roast his hair.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.760]   Like, why is he trying to grow hair now
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:49.880]   after all these years?
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:50.960]   He looked good bald.
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:53.080]   Everyone loved him with his head shaved.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:54.000]   Now it looks kind of strange.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.120]   Like, why you got hair now?
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.000]   - Well, it was one of the more surreal moments of my life.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.480]   So he was here, and he wore a black suit and tie.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.360]   - Oh, really?
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:04.180]   - Yeah, we did the podcast with him,
[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:06.480]   just mirror image of me.
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.640]   And then we also did, I haven't released it yet,
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.920]   but just a video together,
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.200]   and I was doing martial arts stuff in a suit and tie.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:18.200]   That was quite, that's like,
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.040]   certain moments in your life are just like,
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:22.680]   I can't believe I was part of that.
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.800]   - Yeah, from, with GSP, so yeah,
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.200]   I don't think I have anything to roast him about.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:29.680]   I mean, maybe the Matt Serra thing
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:31.560]   would be the one that you get him with, you know?
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.760]   But I would be really fascinated to really dig deep
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:37.920]   from a sports psychology standpoint,
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.620]   because he always talked about how much fear he had
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:40.920]   when he was competing.
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:43.960]   And I find that to be interesting, because obviously,
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:46.120]   so it's almost like, to me, it's almost like,
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.640]   was he successful despite that, not because of that, right?
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:53.160]   And because anxiety usually leads
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:55.440]   to really negative performance for the majority of people.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.400]   And what was it about him
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.800]   that the anxiety wasn't super negative?
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:02.360]   Like, it's very interesting.
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:03.180]   - I wonder that too.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:05.360]   So I have, I wonder that about him,
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:07.440]   but I have a huge amount of anxiety,
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:09.200]   interacting especially with people,
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:10.940]   just about everything, yeah.
[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:13.480]   I wonder if that's helpful or not.
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.240]   It feels like it's very helpful.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.820]   - I think, so okay, I think intuitively,
[02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:20.860]   so I think probably your everyday life, okay,
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:25.220]   is different than like in a performance or a competition.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:28.820]   You have to be like super in the moment of what you're doing.
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:31.740]   So anything that's pulling you away, like, oh my gosh,
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:33.780]   you know, for high school kids, right, that coach,
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.980]   oh my gosh, that girl's in the stands,
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:37.740]   and if I get beat, then,
[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:40.600]   and they're actively thinking about this other thing
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.000]   when this is going on,
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.480]   and I need all 100% of your focus right here.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.120]   - He's never, I don't think he has anxiety in the ring.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:47.960]   That's the point.
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:50.220]   I think, like, I have the same thing.
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:53.920]   Like, if I have a really high performance thing
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.840]   that I have to do, I don't know,
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:57.160]   a lecture in front of a lot of people.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.760]   - Yeah, that'd be a great example.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.120]   - That, there's huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead,
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:03.880]   days ahead, hours ahead.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:06.080]   - So you have a system to get rid of it then?
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.640]   As you perform. - No, maybe,
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:10.320]   but it's just the body gets rid of it somehow.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.600]   Yeah, there's not a system.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.960]   - Subconscious system.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:13.800]   - Yeah, it's self-preservation.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.760]   - So you don't actually have anxiety
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:17.280]   while you're performing. - No.
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.880]   - So that's like, so then that problem,
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:21.900]   somehow that problem has solved itself, right?
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.280]   The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.000]   while the wrestling match is happening,
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.520]   that's the real issue.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:30.240]   - Yeah, but it, like, sneaks in there too,
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:33.000]   is that's the difference between MMA and wrestling,
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.700]   is there's no breaks in wrestling, right?
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:37.540]   - Yes.
[02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:39.960]   - There is, you can look at the crowd a little bit,
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.520]   like, you can look, so maybe.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:42.440]   - Out of bounds, maybe.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:46.520]   - But like, there's other things we have to perform,
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:48.400]   well, there's more breaks, like a lecture,
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.560]   you can catch yourself thinking,
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.160]   like in this conversation, you know?
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.000]   - Yeah.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.440]   - Like, I've said a bunch of stuff where I think,
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.720]   why the hell did you say that?
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:57.080]   That's dumb, right?
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.240]   That's the anxiety, because there's a pause.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:02.600]   And that can be, I don't know,
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.280]   I think it just pushes me to be better,
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:07.780]   but maybe I could be way better if I let go of that.
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:08.620]   - Yeah.
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:10.220]   - It's scary to think that GSB if you let go of that.
[02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:12.300]   - That's what I'm thinking, could he have been better?
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:14.940]   Or did he have a, like you're saying,
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:17.180]   like, you don't necessarily feel those,
[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:19.260]   so I think certain people that I've coached,
[02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:21.580]   like, they would describe how they would feel
[02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:24.180]   literally during the wrestling match, right?
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:27.100]   And you're saying, like, during the speech performance,
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:28.100]   it's mostly gone.
[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:28.940]   - Yep.
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:31.540]   - And that's, it'd be interesting to see if, like,
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:32.700]   he talked a lot about that,
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:35.180]   but if it was all the way somehow gone,
[02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:36.960]   and it means he would have a mechanism for it.
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.160]   So, like, I had a really bad performance
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:41.100]   my freshman year of high school at Nationals,
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.360]   'cause I had the ability to be anxious,
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.860]   and one of my coaches talked about,
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:48.140]   and a lot of A-type personalities are kind of that way,
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.700]   you know, because they're trying to consider
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:51.980]   all possibilities at the same time,
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:54.860]   and while we're actually performing or competing,
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:57.500]   it's negative performance, right?
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:59.540]   So he said he would always,
[02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:01.780]   leading up to the match within, say, an hour,
[02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:03.460]   his thing was talking about fishing.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:04.660]   He would get someone to talk about fishing with him,
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:06.260]   'cause it would stop him thinking about the match
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:08.020]   and being uber anxious.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:09.700]   So I kind of really took that to heart,
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:10.540]   and it really helped me,
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:12.460]   as I would always, like, have someone to talk to,
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:14.780]   and just goof around about whatever.
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:16.500]   So I'm not thinking about this thing,
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:18.340]   and then once I step in, it's time to go.
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:20.900]   So I didn't have this, like, anxious buildup.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:22.400]   Now it's how, for me, I took it away,
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.500]   but, like, you said you have a way to get it away,
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:26.340]   obviously, 'cause it's there, and then it's not.
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:28.860]   - Yeah, I guess there's a little tricks you come up with.
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:30.500]   Yeah, you start thinking about, it's not fishing.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:32.300]   Maybe I should try the fishing thing.
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:34.300]   - I hate fishing, so boring.
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:37.100]   - Well, maybe it's good to think about that.
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:40.340]   All right, Ben, this is, like I told you, I'm a big fan.
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:41.580]   I'm a big fan of your wrestling,
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:43.380]   your fighting, your personality.
[02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:45.140]   Thank you for coming down.
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:46.140]   Thank you for talking today.
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:48.100]   - Appreciate it. - It's a huge honor.
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.820]   Bam, let's go wrestle.
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:53.420]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ben Askren.
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:54.740]   To support this podcast,
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:57.580]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:01.380]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali.
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:04.180]   "Only a man who knows what it is like
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:08.620]   to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of his soul
[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:11.900]   and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:14.580]   to win when the match is even."
[02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:18.300]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:20.900]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:23.500]   (upbeat music)
