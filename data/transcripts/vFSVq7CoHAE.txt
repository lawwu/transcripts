[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   - Next question's from Marie from New York City.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.880]   I work in leadership development
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.920]   for a large healthcare institution.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.860]   I think your ideas on work processes
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.160]   are potentially game-changing
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.700]   for many of the leaders I work with,
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.460]   but I'm struggling with how to share it with them.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.620]   - This is difficult.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.460]   It is difficult.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.440]   I have done some of these events before.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.600]   I have worked with C-suite types.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.140]   I've worked with boards of directors.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.140]   I've worked with the executive cores of Fortune 50 companies.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.560]   It's not always my favorite thing
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.200]   because the corporate world is complicated.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.060]   It's more complicated than I understand,
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.480]   is often more complicated than my ideas fully appreciate
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.640]   because in addition to just producing work,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.360]   there's all of these other constraints,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360]   these social and political constraints of, you know,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.320]   this division traditionally has had this power
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.000]   and they gave it up and this executive VP,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and it is a really complicated,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.240]   it is a complicated world,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.040]   but I will say what seems to help,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.880]   Marie, more so than particular examples,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.000]   more so than particular tactics,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.680]   which might seem at first what you need.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.640]   Can I be more specific?
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.120]   Can you give me more specifics?
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.640]   You don't really wanna be specific when talking with leaders
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.720]   because leaders will hear specifics.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.880]   Oh, I use office hours plus shared documents
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.960]   plus whatever, docket clearing meetings.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.560]   You give specifics and what they hear is
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.040]   where is there a problem with this?
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.820]   Where is there a potential danger with this?
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.560]   Where might this ruffle someone's feathers
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.400]   or get me in trouble?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.440]   It is always easier not to do something new.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.160]   Something new introduces the possibility of problems.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.200]   So I always say with leaders, we're very aware
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.080]   if I don't wanna do something
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.460]   that's gonna create new problems,
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.640]   you wanna get the core principles.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   And I think the core principles you wanna get to
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.000]   when you're talking to a leader is to push them away
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.520]   from a cybernetic definition of productivity,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.780]   get them away from what IT system can we buy
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.860]   that's gonna generate more analytic insights from our data
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.320]   and ensure that we get data sharing at a higher velocity
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.680]   of information accessibility, get them away from that.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.700]   They love that world because there's vendors
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.960]   and you spend money and they have slick slideshows
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.980]   and you feel like you're doing something.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.440]   You gotta say that doesn't really matter.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.660]   Yeah, you can speed stuff up, have more information, great,
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.840]   but this is who cares.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.960]   What matters is the brain.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.320]   The human brain can only focus on one thing at a time
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   and needs relatively long refactoring periods
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.280]   to switch from one target to another.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.720]   This is what we should care about.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.880]   We have a bunch of human brains,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.760]   we wanna think about things and produce value.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.340]   They need time to do it.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.120]   They need the ability to do things one at a time.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.600]   And once we realize that, I would say,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.120]   we then realize that context shifts
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.920]   are like productivity poison.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.400]   That's the thing we're trying to minimize.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.880]   We don't need IT systems that makes the velocity
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.080]   of information transfer higher
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.840]   or the depth of analytical insights sharper.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.200]   We need less context shifts.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   You want these leaders to be going through their day
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.920]   after talking to you mentally in their mind,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.720]   keeping a counter of, well, how many times
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.380]   do I have to switch my attention to something else
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.480]   and back to something else?
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.680]   You want them to slowly become sort of disgusted
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.100]   with the reality that they discover.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.720]   My God, every time I'm doing this, I can feel it now.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   I can almost feel the cerebral sludge that's building up
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   as I keep switching back and forth.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.360]   I can see my concentration fading.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   I can see my energy dissipating.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.600]   And then they start to think, okay,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.920]   so when we think about productivity,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.280]   what we think about is minimizing doses of this poison.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.900]   Even if this slows us down,
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.480]   even if it introduces friction,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.080]   even if that executive VP over there
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.100]   that has bad blood with me is gonna get mad about it,
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.680]   even if it is a pain in the moment,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.640]   now I realize this is what we have to do
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.700]   is stop the context shift.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.200]   So we have to rethink everything.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.280]   How do we allocate work?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200]   How do we talk about work?
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.160]   How do we collaborate?
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.720]   What are our processes for moving information around?
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.000]   We are ready to go through the pain
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   of building an attention-centric productivity environment,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.080]   a workplace that actually respects
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.440]   how the human brain functions.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.480]   And then they can come up with the very specific things
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.820]   that make sense for their work,
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.400]   for their tools, for the people they work with.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.320]   Then they can figure that out.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.080]   So anyways, Murray, that's what I've increasingly
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.720]   come to realize.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.380]   Forget examples and get the principles.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.320]   Because if they're a leader at a big company
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.860]   or a large healthcare institution, they're smart.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.200]   They're very smart.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.300]   They notice the issues.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.760]   They know what's not working.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.080]   They can understand deep principles.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.480]   They can generate tactics out of it.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.460]   So anyways, I've been big about that recently.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.080]   The weeds are too messy in corporate America.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   It's why I don't go around and try to consult for companies
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.600]   and say, "Let me help you rebuild
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.960]   "your communication protocols," or something like this,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.020]   because the weeds are so thick and bespoke,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.760]   and every company has their own very specific issues,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.840]   and it's very difficult for an outsider to move through.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.180]   And an outsider can only do so much anyways.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.320]   You need the people right there
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   that are stuck in these weeds to recognize
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.400]   that a better plant needs to grow there.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.560]   You need them to realize what the problem is,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.420]   and then they can generate the solutions.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.500]   They know more about their company than I do.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.340]   They know more about their group
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.060]   than a leadership development executive does.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.620]   So the best thing we can do is teach them what the issue is,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.880]   and then let them actually come up with problems.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.920]   - That was a good analogy with a plant.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.140]   - Plants and weeds, yeah.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.300]   You know, I could do that, Jesse.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.220]   I could be.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.100]   This is my problem, is I'll write about
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.100]   all the stuff I write about since 2015, basically.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.000]   Everything I write about, in some ways,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.460]   about technology intersecting
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.840]   with different parts of our life.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   So technology intersecting with work, of course,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.680]   is a big thing.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.720]   All this productivity talk is about work
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.660]   in an age of digital distraction
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.920]   and high-velocity cybernetic productivity notions.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.200]   It's all about technology intersecting work.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.900]   Digital minimalism is about technology
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.960]   intersecting our personal lives.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.740]   This is what I care about, right?
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.480]   But the issue is I'll deal with a particular topic,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.580]   and I'll think about it deeply and produce some big ideas,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.480]   and then I move on.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.200]   But the problem is the ideas are still out there.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.860]   So, you know, Deep Work had a bunch of ideas
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.320]   that I thought were very important.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.500]   But then I went on and wrote a bunch of other books,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.480]   and yet there's a lot of people who are saying,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.640]   "Well, can't you just come and help us do Deep Work?"
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.480]   That's the issue.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.400]   It's not my instinct of, let me just stick with a topic
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.840]   and really keep pushing it and promoting it.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.880]   I like the idea.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.140]   I want to understand.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.480]   I get the pleasure out of understanding something new.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.860]   And by the time people are catching on with something,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.200]   a lot of times I've moved on to sort of the next topic
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.040]   I'm trying to understand.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.180]   So this is why I don't travel the world,
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.620]   you know, running workshops.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.960]   This would probably be pretty lucrative, actually,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.560]   but running workshops about, you know,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.760]   how to make your team deeper, building processes.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.600]   I don't know, just actually,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.420]   we could probably make a lot of money.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.800]   Maybe you and I should just fly around the world
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.000]   and have people cancel their Slack accounts
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.540]   and do office hours and market clearing meetings.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.500]   We could wear suits.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.660]   - Well, then you wouldn't be able to read books
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.900]   in the woods like you're doing right now.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.620]   So that wouldn't be as fun. - That's the problem.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.460]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.060]   Yeah, well, here's what we'll do,
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.580]   like in "Good Will Hunting,"
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.100]   when Ben Affleck went to the meeting
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.780]   with the NSA instead of Matt Damon,
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.140]   I'm gonna send you,
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.300]   and you're gonna give like very bombastic speeches
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.980]   on my behalf that like involve, for whatever reason,
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.460]   like a lot of sort of onstage flexing and weightlifting.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.300]   I don't know why.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.660]   I just think this would be great.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.140]   Just to mystify people,
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.140]   just to have you run out and be like,
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.980]   focus is like- - The correct form
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.860]   to deadlift is this.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.700]   - Exactly.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   Now, I don't know why I would want you
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.560]   having doing deadlifts.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.140]   I just have this vision of you in like gym pants
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.620]   and like a muscle shirt.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.700]   Like, okay, deep work is like lifting heavy weights.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   Every rep. - I can't even lift
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.980]   that heavy weights.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.820]   - No, I know.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.260]   And it's not like this is something you do.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.420]   I just thought it'd be funny.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.140]   I'm just thinking like what the opposite would be.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.300]   And then to flip it around,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.620]   then you should have me take over some of your coaching,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.380]   sports coaching responsibilities.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.860]   And then I would just be terrible at that.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.400]   I'd be like, well, the lacrosse ball,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.260]   we have to think about it like an idea
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.260]   that is evolving through a network of competing ideas.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.980]   And then so is it really, are you catching the ball
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.220]   or is it an idea that we're formulating?
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.900]   And so that's what we'll do.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.020]   - Ah, I'm actually going to an event right after this.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.380]   This is why I'm wearing a nicer shirt
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.940]   is right after we get off the air here,
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.380]   I'm going over to the Rockefeller Center,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.820]   which is the School of Public Policy and Social Sciences
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.960]   here at Dartmouth.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.900]   And I'm doing a fireside chat.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.880]   We're gonna go, I'm gonna sit in a chair
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.940]   and be interviewed by another professor
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.300]   in theory for an audience.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.420]   We'll see, but--
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.260]   - That's cool.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.540]   You had the fireside chats in your courses back in the day.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.340]   I took those before I even knew you.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.980]   - Didn't, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.140]   Scott and I, Scott Young and I had fireside chats.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.300]   Was this in--
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.460]   - You can hear the fire crackling in the background.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.260]   - Yeah, so the VAT put in the fire crackling sound?
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.100]   - Yeah.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.340]   - That's great, I love it, I love it.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.380]   Yeah, yeah, we did these fireside chats.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.100]   So this would have been for, was it Life of Focus?
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.380]   - I think it was Focus, yeah.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.960]   - Yeah, yeah, so we did these fireside chats
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.660]   where we would talk about what had happened
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.680]   in that week of the course.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.580]   And then, yeah, shout out to VAT,
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.900]   Scott's longtime producer, I think added fire sounds.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.020]   I'm actually talking to Scott, I think tomorrow, so.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.340]   (upbeat music)
