[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.000]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 8 and verses 21 and 24.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.480]   Verses 21 and 24 in the 8th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.320]   sins; whether I go, ye cannot come.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.000]   I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.200]   am he, ye shall die in your sins.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:06.520]   Now we are considering in this whole paragraph running from verse 12 or 13 right away to
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.360]   the end of the chapter the reaction of the Jews who were the contemporaries of our Lord
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.160]   and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.920]   He stood up in the temple and he uttered these amazing and astonishing words.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.320]   He said, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.480]   shall have the light of life.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   The greatest statement possibly that has ever been uttered in this world of time.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.400]   The most momentous statement.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.560]   And yet we find here as we begin to read at verse 13 that the effect it had upon these
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.360]   Jews was to make them question him, insult him, try to trap him in his conversation.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.520]   The Jews, the Pharisees therefore we read said unto him, thou barest record of thyself;
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   thy record is not true.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.440]   Now and then the story goes on.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.800]   In other words they reacted against him and so we are told at the end of the chapter that
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.840]   they took up stones to throw them at him.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.120]   And these were the same people who later on instigated all the people to cry out together
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.520]   saying away with him, crucify him.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   And thereby brought about his death.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.160]   Now this I say is the standing problem of the human race.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   But though the Son of God has come into it and has offered to us everything we stand
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.480]   in need of, offering us light and knowledge and understanding, reconciliation with God,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   power in our daily lives, the only way to reconcile men with men and to abolish war
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.680]   and to introduce peace, he has offered everything we need.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.760]   And yet the world rejected him when he was here and it has continued to reject him ever
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.360]   since.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.800]   Now I say that is the great problem.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.760]   What is it that makes men do that?
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.160]   What is it that makes men and women still do that?
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.460]   Why is there anybody in the world tonight who is not a Christian?
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:34.600]   Why is there anybody still battling against these odds and difficulties and problems?
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.680]   What is the explanation of this?
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.480]   Well we are considering this.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.800]   We've seen already that it's a general wrong spirit.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.760]   We've seen also that it's due to a fatal ignorance.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.880]   Ignorant of their own ignorance.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.040]   Ignorant of their own impotence.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.880]   Ignorant of their real fundamental needs.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.540]   There are some of the things that we've already considered but here tonight in these two verses
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.920]   we come across a further explanation.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.720]   And it is this.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.760]   And I suppose this is the final and the ultimate explanation of why anybody refuses the offer
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.320]   of this blessed person who says, "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.720]   shall have the light of life."
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   What is it?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   It's this.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.080]   It is a failure to realize the consequences of refusing him.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.760]   The failure to realize the consequences, the inevitable consequences, of rejecting him.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.720]   Now that is the thing with which our Lord deals in these two verses because here he
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:05:00.120]   is dealing with one of the consequences of this rejection, this refusal.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:08.080]   And it is of course a consequence that affects the way in which a man dies.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.760]   Now that's what he's talking about you notice.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.520]   Then said Jesus again to them, "I go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.600]   yourselves."
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.120]   Now he regarded this as being so important that he repeats it.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.320]   He says it twice over.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.000]   Here it is again, "I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in yourselves for if
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.040]   ye believe not that I am he, you shall die in yourselves."
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.360]   When our Lord repeats a thing like that there's always a very good reason for it.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.480]   And there is no question at all that the reason is that the matter is so desperately serious.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.520]   He's doing his utmost to make them see it.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.040]   So he repeats it.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.720]   Very well I say here is one of the consequences that men and women don't think of at all,
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.840]   never enters their minds and yet he says it's a fact.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.680]   It is a consequence.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.160]   He says the way you are going to die is something that is fundamentally affected by your reaction
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.540]   to who I am and what I say and what I'm offering to you.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.640]   Now that's the question therefore I want to consider with you this evening.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.840]   There is nowhere in which we see the devastating effects of sin upon mankind more than just
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.640]   in a case like this.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.760]   Of all the terrible things that the fall and men entering into a state of sin did and produced,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:53.040]   the most awful, the most terrible is that which sin has done to men's minds, to their
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   thinking.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   Now I know the popular thing to say today is this, that to be religious means that you
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.640]   don't think but you know the whole case of the Bible is the exact opposite.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.760]   It says that people are not religious because they don't know how to think and I think I
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.200]   can prove that to you this evening.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.280]   It is sheer failure to think that makes people reject the Son of God and especially when
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.840]   he tells them that he is the light of the world.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   How do we do that?
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.920]   Well let's look at it like this.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.080]   The most important question I say for us, any of us to consider in this world, is just
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.800]   this question of how are we going to die.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.200]   "Oh, but sir, someone that is to be morbid, fancy on a fine Sunday night like this.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.960]   No wonder they say the people are in the parks and in the cinemas and everywhere else.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.080]   If you preachers are just going to talk to us about how we are going to die."
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.840]   Well now wait a minute my friend.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:05.080]   What I'm saying is that this is the most important and the most urgent problem that any human
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.640]   being can ever face.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.320]   It ought to be priority number one on our thinking list.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   Why?
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.200]   Well let me tell you.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.480]   One good reason for it is this, that we know that it's going to happen to every one of
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.160]   us.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.280]   You can't say that about everything.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.160]   There are many things that are possibilities, but this is an absolute certainty.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.400]   Some people are going to do well in life, others are not going to do so well.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.360]   Some are going to be ill, some are going to be wonderfully healthy right through their
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   lives.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.780]   Some are going on their holidays, some unfortunately can't go.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.520]   Some are going to make a lot of money, others are going to just manage to eke out an existence
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.840]   somehow anyhow.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Some are going to get married, some are not.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.240]   All these differences, we know all about them don't we?
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.080]   But you know here's something that's true of everybody, we've all got to die, every
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.700]   one of us.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.600]   And it can't be evaded, it cannot be avoided.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.760]   Do what you will, you can't get away from this.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.360]   Then you see another thing we all know is this, that everything that happens to us in
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.320]   this world is bound to come to an end.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   That's another way of saying that we've all got to die, but it's important to put it like
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.720]   that because think of all these things for which people are living tonight.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.320]   These people I mean who don't like being told to think about death, "Ah" they say, "but
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.040]   I'm tremendously interested and fascinated in this subject or in that interest."
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.560]   All right, all I'm saying is that whatever you're interested in, it's bound to come to
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   an end.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.480]   And again, you can do nothing at all about that.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.160]   Another very good reason for putting this as the first question we consider is this
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.000]   one.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.360]   Here is something you know that we only do once.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.760]   There's no second chance here.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.360]   You may be sitting in examination at the present time, or you may have just done so.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.600]   The results will soon be out and you may be told that you have failed.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.280]   It's all right, you can try again.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.480]   You may have gone a little bit astray in your business.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.200]   Well, it's all right, you needn't be filled with despair, have another attempt at it.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.960]   Organize your business in a different way.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.120]   Has your married life been going a little bit astray?
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.680]   Well, it's all right, you can even start again there.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.880]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.280]   You can always try again, but you know my friend, you only die once.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.440]   Never again.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.840]   Now this is common sense, isn't it?
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.360]   If I've got many opportunities and chances to do a thing, well, I needn't be so careful.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.880]   If I'm a wise man, I'll do my best the first time, of course.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.760]   But I always know that if it goes wrong, I can try again.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.280]   But when I'm told that here is something that I'm only going to do once in this life, and
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.700]   never again, never another opportunity, I only die once, well, I say I ought to give
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.160]   unusual and exceptional attention to such a subject.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   And that is the truth about death.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.400]   And then a final reason for considering it is this.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.120]   What lies beyond it?
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.280]   You go out of this world, where do you go?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.960]   Well now, there it is.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.320]   There is a possibility.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.960]   I say that and that alone are to make a start with this.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.920]   Very well.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.560]   But you see, the trouble is that instead of looking at this as the first and the most
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.520]   urgent problem, the world doesn't do that.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.960]   Yet our Lord says this is the important thing.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.800]   The first consequence, he says, of rejecting me is, well, that it's going to affect the
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.520]   way in which you die.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.000]   Now then, let me ask a question.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.800]   Have you ever considered how you're going to die?
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.600]   Well, let's look at ourselves, let's look at the world.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   What is the position?
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.480]   We know perfectly well the position is this.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.880]   There are large numbers of people in this world this evening who never consider this
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.960]   question at all.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.280]   They refuse to consider it.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.160]   They've never sat down and faced it.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.920]   They have never stood face to face with this certain fact of death.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.840]   They've never looked at it, never examined it.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.000]   I don't want to take any time this evening enjoying how utterly irrational that is, putting
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.120]   it at its lowest.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.880]   It must be sheer folly.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:03.520]   Because I say of its inevitability, its inexorability, and the fact that I only do it once, and yet
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.320]   people never give it a thought, not a moment's attention.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.000]   But I'm concerned about it tonight from a different angle, and that different angle
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.840]   is this.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.760]   You see, what our Lord is saying is, he says, you know, your attitude to me is due to the
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:27.800]   fact that you are not considering it in the light of the fact that you're going to die.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.680]   Now that's the thing I want to emphasize this evening.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.520]   How do people approach this question of Christianity?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.480]   Here I am telling you that a person has been in this world who has said, "I am the light
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.480]   of the world.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.920]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.720]   How are people facing it?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.920]   Well, the majority of course are facing it like this, aren't they?
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:03.520]   They're facing it in an utterly theoretical and academic and detached manner.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.040]   Their attitude towards it all is, "Well, oh, well, all right, yes, I'm prepared to have
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.320]   a debate about religion.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.920]   I'm always ready for that.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.440]   You'll never find me backwards there."
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.800]   And so, of course, they give their opinions about God and about men, about heaven and
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:24.000]   hell and life and death and all these great matters, and they do it with an attitude of
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.240]   supreme detachment, as if they'd got an endless lease on life and as if it was just a matter
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.000]   that you look at casually as you give your expression on many other things in this world,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.400]   quite detached, so you can give your view on these great and fundamental questions.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:54.800]   Now that is the serious thing, because my dear friend, you and I are not detached.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.640]   We are not in a theoretical position.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.440]   We are not just on lookers at the game.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.560]   We are not just sitting there in a gallery and looking at people playing there in the
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.320]   arena and we express our opinions and judge, "Ah, that was a mistake there.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   He shouldn't have done that.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   He should have done this."
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   Of course, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.800]   It doesn't affect us at all.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.000]   It was pure enjoyment.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.960]   It makes no difference to us whether the man wins or loses, does it right or wrong.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.400]   It's a matter of interest, but we're not involved.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.720]   It's not going to affect our lives.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:31.520]   Well, you know, people look on exactly like that and treat in exactly the same way, "God,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.680]   Jesus Christ of Nazareth, themselves, their souls, everything."
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   That's the view.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   Well, why do they do that?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.280]   Well, there's only one answer.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:49.540]   You see, they don't look at it all in the light of the fact of death.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.040]   They don't realize that we're all involved in this and that these are the things that
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.080]   are going to determine our eternal destiny.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.460]   It is this fatal attachment.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.180]   It is this healthiness.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:08.080]   We solemnly sit back, I say, and give our opinions as these people were doing with the
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.760]   Lord himself.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.200]   And he says, "You know, you're doing that because you don't realize the difference
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.280]   it's going to make to you when you die."
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.520]   They hadn't thought about that.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:25.400]   They'd never brought all this into the context of life and death and eternity.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.600]   And men and women are still not doing that.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.720]   They think that political and economic and social questions are more urgent than these.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.680]   "Ah, but they said those affect us, you know."
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.440]   You see, what's done in Parliament affects me.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.100]   It affects my wage packet.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.100]   It affects my salary.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.480]   It affects the income tax I pay.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.240]   It affects my comfort in my home.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   It affects the future.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.960]   Ah, these things, of course we're interested.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.840]   They say these things are going to make a difference to us.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.040]   But when you come to religion, well, of course, that's pure philosophy.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.920]   That's a matter of argument, point of view, debate, discussion.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.640]   And so we take ourselves right out.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.880]   But my dear friend, you're more involved here than anywhere.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:10.320]   It is here you are really involved, and especially at that point of death.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:17.560]   This is the thing, says our Lord, that determines exactly how a man dies.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.200]   And yet I say people never give a thought to the fact of death.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.160]   They dismiss it altogether.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.600]   It's never allowed to enter into the calculation.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.680]   I would leave this point, therefore, by putting it like this to you.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:41.600]   Do you consider everything in the light of the fact that you're going to die?
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.320]   Do you know that your opinion of God and about God is going to make a difference to you on
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.320]   your deathbed?
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.400]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.760]   Do you realize that this question of Jesus Christ and who he is is going to be the most
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.240]   vital and urgent matter there?
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.080]   Have you realized the significance of all these, that they're not theoretical?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.520]   They're the most practical thing in the world, and especially in that most crucial
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.600]   act of going out of this life into another.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:22.120]   I know of nothing that is so utterly foolish, such a manifestation of tragic folly, as not
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:30.160]   to face all questions, and especially this one, in the light of the certain fact of death.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.560]   But come, let us look at another group.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.240]   There's a group that never considers it at all.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:41.200]   There are other people who look at the fact of death in a wrong way.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:48.140]   It isn't that they don't think at all, but that their thinking about death is wrong.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.140]   In what respects?
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.140]   Well, there are several.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.520]   Let me just note some of them in passing.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   Here's one.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:59.320]   There are some people to whom death is nothing but the sort of final calamity.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   "Oh, well, they say, of course, I recognize the fact of death, but I don't think about
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.800]   it because it's so unpleasant.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.160]   It makes me feel unhappy."
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   What is death?
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.960]   Well, death is just the last calamity.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.840]   Death is the end of life, and that's all it is to them.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   They want to go on living.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   That's all right.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.880]   But you see, death to them is nothing but just the end of this business of living, the
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.680]   end of all I enjoy and I want to hold on to.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.280]   Death, calamity, awful, terrible specter.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   Don't think about it.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.240]   Do your best not to think about it.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.300]   Be bright and cheerful and happy.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.300]   Don't look at these things.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.560]   If you have to attend a funeral, forget all about it as quickly as you can.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.560]   Go on.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.480]   Don't stay with these things, otherwise it'll spoil your life in the present.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.800]   You want every minute of it, and you want to get the maximum out of every minute.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:00.120]   Death, it's a calamity, the end of life.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   That's a view.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   Then there is another view, which looks at it like this.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.440]   It isn't simply that it is the end of all they've been living for and enjoying.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:22.080]   My view of death is a little more philosophical, and it says that, well, death, of course,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.880]   is literally the end.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.520]   These are a little more thoughtful than the last group, because they say, "Well, I don't
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.160]   think about it because my view is that when a man dies, well, that's the end of the story.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.800]   There's no more to be said."
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.960]   He takes the view of prospero.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:51.200]   We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.000]   That's it.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.640]   It's just the end, you see.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.440]   And there's no difference between a man and a tree or a flower.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.200]   Death, you see, is the end.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.000]   Therefore, you needn't be worried about death.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.840]   It's all right, you can do nothing about it.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.600]   Well, don't think about it then, because it's all right, you're finished.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.720]   It's the end of you as far as you are concerned.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.920]   There's no more to it than just that.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.440]   Death is the end, the final end.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.680]   Not merely the end of the things that you enjoy, but your end.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.000]   It's the end of you.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.600]   You don't exist any longer.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.840]   That's it, they say, finished.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.760]   That's another false view of death.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:35.120]   Because I want to put that in the terms of the third false view of death, which gives
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:44.000]   the lie direct to the second, which is the view of death that is taken by spiritists
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.880]   and people who believe in what they call spiritualism.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.960]   You know, there are many such people.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.120]   They don't believe that death is the end of men as a personality.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.040]   No, no, they say men goes on living.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.280]   There is a life beyond death, and there they go to their seances, and they indulge in all
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.520]   their speculations and in their experimentations, and they say there is tangible absolute proof
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.920]   that there is a life beyond death and that people still go on living, and they'll give
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920]   you messages.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   They'll tell you how they go on living, and the message they apparently give is that it's
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.520]   very much as it is here.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.640]   They go on drinking and doing all the things they've been doing here.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   But that is, according to the scripture, again, a completely false view of death.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   It is a view.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.840]   Yes, but I am concerned to show that a false view is quite as bad as not to have any view
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   at all.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.400]   It's as bad to think wrongly about death as it is to think not to think at all about death.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.560]   And there are many who are in that position today.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.000]   They're trying to get into touch with their loved ones, and they feel they can still influence,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.680]   and that we go on to that sort of existence.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.480]   But on the whole, the impression is given that it's all right and that you've got nothing
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.080]   to worry about, and that it's just a continuation of this.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.440]   You take up where you left off here, and you join your boon companions, and on you go.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.480]   Spiritism.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.400]   But I suppose that of all the false and the wrong ways of thinking about death at the
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:26.880]   present time, the strangest of all is the most popular of all at the present time, and
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:36.760]   that is the concentration upon only the physical mode of death.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   Have you noticed it?
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:45.000]   Now, it's here you see the effect of sin upon the mind of men and upon his thought processes.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.120]   There are many serious people in the world tonight who are giving a great deal of time
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:56.520]   and thought and attention to this question of dying, as to how a man's going to die.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.240]   But what is their interest?
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:06.800]   Ah, their interest you see is only in the way in which a man's going to die.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:14.120]   Now they say, "Are we going to be all exterminated by this bomb?
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.520]   Are we all going to be blasted out of this life and out of this world by some horrible
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.960]   explosion?"
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.080]   And they say, "This is tremendous."
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.960]   And they organize meetings, and they organize marches.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   You're familiar with all this.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   What are they concerned about?
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.280]   Well, they're concerned about the way in which a man's going to die.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.960]   "Am I not going to be allowed to die on my bed?
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.680]   Am I going to be blown by an atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb?
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.240]   That's the terrible thing they say, that we're going to be killed like that."
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.000]   You see the interest, don't you?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.320]   It's an interest in the mere mode of death.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.120]   It's an interest in the mere mechanics of death, nothing else.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.320]   But they're tremendously interested in this.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.880]   They never give any other thought to death, but they're always thinking about this, and
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.360]   they're always talking about, "This is the thing, we must stop this," they say.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.240]   "We must somehow or other get the nations to stop this.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.360]   Is mankind going to be killed like this?"
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.560]   As if that were the urgent and the important question.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.700]   You see the trouble?
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:21.160]   They don't seem to be interested at all in the fact that we've all got to die in any
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   case.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.520]   They never say a word about that.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.720]   All they talk about is the way in which we're going to die.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.080]   "This," they say, "is awful.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.520]   We must do something about it."
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.940]   Not a word about the fact that whether all these bombs are let off or not.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.800]   We every one of us will have to die.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:49.640]   We may just peter out, as it were, as the result of old age and failure.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.000]   We may die with some terrible raging fever.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.920]   We've all got to die.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   They never give it a thought.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.280]   They're only interested in the mode, the manner, the mechanism, the mere machinery,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.400]   as it were, the thing that brings the end, as if that were the thing that counted, and
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.880]   not the fact of death.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.200]   Don't you see the effect of sin upon the human mind?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.800]   Don't you see how sin fools mankind, intelligent and able people?
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.040]   You see, they're interested in the thing that is comparatively irrelevant and are leaving
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.920]   out of account the thing that is absolutely vital and central and all-important.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:39.280]   Very well then, my friend, I don't hesitate to ask you this question.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.640]   I am speaking in particular to those who are so concerned at the present time about the
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.400]   possibility of another war and the use of these bombs.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.320]   I simply want to ask you a question.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.760]   Have you ever faced just the fact of death itself?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.040]   Not in terms of bombs or wars, but death itself.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   Have you faced and are you concerned about the fact that you are going to die, or is
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.320]   it only about this mode of death?
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:15.920]   Can't you see that it's madness if that's your position?
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.080]   I'll grant you that it's quite right to be concerned about the bombs and the way in which
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   a man dies.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.760]   What I'm saying is this, that if you're only concerned about that and have never faced
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:33.720]   the fact that you've got to die in any case, that you're straining at a gnat and swallowing
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.840]   a camel, you're like the Pharisees, you're making a tremendous fuss about something on
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.520]   the circumference and you're ignorant about the thing that is vital at the centre.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:51.640]   But that was the trouble with these Pharisees, as it is still the trouble with a large number
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   of people.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.840]   Their interest in death is an entirely false one, it's a wrong one.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.680]   They've never faced the real thing, which brings me to my third consideration, which
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.720]   is this.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.400]   That the ultimate trouble with the unbeliever is not so much even that he fails to think
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.840]   about death at all or that he thinks about it in the wrong way, is that he fails completely
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   to think about it in the right way.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   What's that?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.000]   Now that's the very thing that our Lord tells us here.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.560]   Listen to him again.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.880]   This thing which he says twice over.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:36.720]   "Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.640]   your sins.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:50.600]   I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins, for if ye believe not that I
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.400]   am he, you shall die in your sins."
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.960]   There it is for you, in reality three times over.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.320]   Why does he repeat this?
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.360]   Well his point is this, you see.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:10.760]   There is only one right view of death and it is the spiritual view of death.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.920]   There is only one thing that really matters in this matter of death and that is the condition
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:23.080]   of a man's soul as he dies.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:33.440]   In other words, according to our blessed Lord and Saviour, there are only two ways of dying.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.720]   And the only thing that we've got to think about is these two ways of dying.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.080]   That's what he's teaching.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:52.880]   There are, he says, it can be boiled down to this, only two ways of dying.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.880]   What are they?
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.560]   Is it, am I to die of a heart attack?
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.080]   Is it that I'm to die of a raging fever?
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.240]   Is it that I'm to be killed in an accident?
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   Is it that I'm to be killed by the letting off an atomic bomb?
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.800]   Is it that I'm to be killed on the field of battle in the third world war?
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.520]   Not a bit of it.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:21.400]   They don't come into his consideration at all for the reason that I've been giving you.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.680]   Those things only affect the dying of the body.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.560]   They're very important from that standpoint.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   But they never get beyond the body.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.920]   It doesn't matter which of those ways in which I meet my end.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.320]   It's only my body that's involved.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.200]   But says Christ, that isn't what matters.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:45.680]   The only thing that matters is the state of your soul when you die.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:52.560]   And here he says that there are only two ways of dying.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.280]   Everybody who's ever been born into this world will die in one of two ways.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:06.560]   You either die in your sins or else you die in the Lord.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.120]   I said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins, for if you believe not that
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.760]   I am he, you shall die in your sins.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.080]   He says that these people are going to die in your sins.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:30.000]   Then says the book of Revelation, blessed are those that die in the Lord.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.360]   There you've got the only two ways of dying.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.560]   Two men die of exactly the same sort of heart attack.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:48.400]   Yes, but one of them dies in his sins and the other dies in the Lord.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.120]   Two men are killed in the atomic bomb explosion.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.560]   Yes, I know the mode of death is the same, but the way in which they die isn't the same.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:04.160]   One dies in his sins, the other dies in the Lord.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.840]   Two men die of old age.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.520]   Yes, but their way of dying isn't the same.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.280]   One dies in his sins and the other dies in the Lord.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.200]   Yes, my friend, it's the only thing that matters.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   What does it mean?
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.760]   Therefore, let's look at it together.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:28.160]   What does our Lord mean when he says that these people are going to die in their sins?
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.280]   He says you don't believe in me, and because you don't believe in me you're going to die
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   in your sins.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.280]   What's it mean?
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:49.880]   It means this, you are going to die exactly as you are now, with all that that means.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:57.400]   With all your past upon you, lying heavily upon you, you die just as you are now.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:05.840]   Yes, but you see it means many things in addition to that.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:15.440]   For a man to die in his sins means this, that he doesn't know what's happening to him.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.320]   He's never thought about it, doesn't understand it.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.040]   He suddenly realizes that his life is ebbing out and that he's coming to an end, but he
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.480]   doesn't know what's happening, he doesn't understand, he can give no explanation.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.680]   It's a strange experience, he's never been that way before.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.960]   He can't go back, he's going out, he's going forward, and he doesn't know, he doesn't understand,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:47.600]   he's dying in his sins.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:54.840]   Another thing that happens to a man who's dying in his sins in that way is this, that
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:00.480]   all the things for which he has lived and on which he has lived until that moment, he
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:07.680]   suddenly finds that have no value to him.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:15.680]   He's lived a life for this world only, he's lived for physical, animal pleasures, but
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.120]   he can no longer have them, he's too weak.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.520]   What tempted him before doesn't tempt him now, he hasn't got the energy.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.720]   He's dying, he's going out, he's lived for all those things, he's never thought of anything
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.680]   else and they don't help him.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:38.080]   He looks to them but they've nothing to say.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.560]   The music that he's enjoyed seems to mock him and to taunt him and he hates it.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:51.200]   No comfort, no stimulus, no kick, no excitement, he can't help himself, there he is and it's
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:35:00.080]   of no value, all he's lived for is nothing, it's worse than nothing.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:08.240]   That's what it means for a man to die in his sins, yes, but it means something much worse.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.600]   He has an awful feeling that he's guilty.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.960]   Suddenly in a flash the whole of his past life passes in front of him and he sees now
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.320]   that it's all wrong.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.000]   All his life he's stifled his conscience, acted against it, kept it down, argued and
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.600]   reasoned against it.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:40.080]   Suddenly it asserts itself and his past comes and he knows it's wrong, he feels condemned.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:47.200]   Even worse is the fact that he is condemned in the sight of God and under the curse and
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.960]   under the wrath of God against sin.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:36:00.280]   All this comes to him now, he hadn't seen it before, it suddenly comes to him.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:05.400]   The commandments that he's stifled again and kept down, they begin to speak to him,
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:10.920]   "Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.040]   not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, thou shalt honour the Lord thy God and him
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.240]   only shalt thou serve," and he hasn't done it.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.600]   And there he is dying and it all comes back.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.720]   He's dying in his sins, surrounded by them, in the atmosphere of them.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.840]   That's his position.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:47.120]   And there he glimpses into the future and he sees flashes of hell and torment and misery.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:52.560]   He's filled with a sense of remorse and loathing for the things he's done.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.840]   He hates himself and feels he's been a fool.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.360]   He's lived his life without thinking of this.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.120]   This most vital thing is going out of the present into the unknown future and he doesn't
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   know, he doesn't understand, nothing helps him for which he has lived.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:17.400]   And there he sees these awful things ahead of him.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:26.160]   And I believe at that point also he is given a glimpse of heaven and of glory, but realizes
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.920]   that he's unfit for it.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:37.040]   It's clean, it's pure, it's light, it's holy, and he knows he wouldn't be happy there.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.560]   He's never thought of those things.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.360]   He's lived for the opposite.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.640]   And there is God in his glory and all this purity and all this worship.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.880]   He's not interested, he never has been, and yet he sees it's wonderful and glorious, but
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:56.240]   he's unfit, he can't go there.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.480]   And he knows he's utterly, absolutely helpless.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.840]   He can't undo his past life.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.640]   He can't blot out the sins he's deliberately committed.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   He can't do it.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.960]   He knows he can't do it.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   He can't go back and undo them.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.080]   Neither can he prepare himself for the future because he's dying and there are the two things
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   before him.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.240]   And he doesn't know he's utterly helpless and he's completely hopeless.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.520]   He can't do anything.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.640]   His loved ones are standing there looking on.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   They can't help him.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.080]   They know no more than he does.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   His boon companions, what do they know?
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.920]   They're still living for the same things.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.800]   They know nothing about the spiritual.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.120]   They know nothing about life beyond the veil.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.560]   He cries out and nobody can help him.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.120]   He's alone, desperate.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.840]   He shall seek me, says our Lord, and he shall not find me.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.640]   You shall die in your sins.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.980]   He cries out, can no one help me?
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.400]   And there's not an answer.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:55.800]   It's an awful silence left to himself as he is with his past taunting him and condemning
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:05.040]   him and the wrath of God ahead of him.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:12.320]   That is how a man dies in his sins.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:19.560]   And he suddenly realizes that he'll spend his eternity like that.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.240]   Never another chance, no coming back and doing something better.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:29.880]   No no, eternal, absolute destiny fixed.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:39.180]   And that he's going to spend eternity in that misery and wretchedness and that useless remorse.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.420]   Spending his blunder and his folly in not having thought about these things and not
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:52.000]   having prepared himself and having taken those steps at all to ensure that his eternal future
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.920]   is going to be one of bliss and of happiness and of joy.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:12.320]   Yet according to the teaching of the Bible is how a man dies in his sins as he is unprepared,
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:21.120]   ignorant, not knowing where he's going, not understanding it and yet going through.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:32.080]   And all that ahead of him.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:51.320]   God's simply telling you something that's going to happen to you.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:41:14.200]   Do you know how to die and do you know how you are going to die?
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:20.560]   You said, "Oh people, to these Jews who are rejecting Him, you are going to die in your
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:26.960]   sins because you don't believe in Me, because you don't reject Me."
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.880]   He said, "I said that unto you.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.120]   That's why I said that you shall die in your sins.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:40.920]   For if you believe not that I am He, you shall die in your sins, guilty before God, helpless,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.160]   lost and going to an eternity of misery."
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.320]   That's your position.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.360]   There's only one alternative to that and that is, as I say, to die in the Lord.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.920]   Listen to Revelation 14, 13.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:06.200]   Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.880]   It's got to be one or the other, you die in your sins or you die in the Lord.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:18.200]   And this is blessed, "Oh happy the man that dies in the Lord from henceforth."
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.480]   What does it mean?
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   What is this other way of dying?
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:29.000]   Well let me tell you what the scripture tells us about it.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.720]   It was the sort of death, you know, that that howling prophet Balaam wanted to die.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   Do you remember what he said?
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.000]   Balaam was a very poor man.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.920]   He was one of these cute, clever fellows, you know, that would sell his soul in order
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.300]   to make a little money.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:48.600]   He was a dishonest prophet and yet, you know, even that man, he was clever, he was cunning,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.320]   he was cute enough to see this.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:43:01.360]   He said, "Let me die the death of the godly and let my latter end be as his."
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.840]   Remember we say against Balaam he was a very acute observer.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.680]   He'd been present at the deathbed of many a man, many a friend, many a companion, and
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.600]   he'd noticed that there were two ways of dying, you see.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Some people had died very unhappily, you could see it on their faces, it was terrible.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.080]   But others were dying in glory.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.680]   And you know these were the godly people and he said, "Let me die the death of the godly.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.980]   When my time comes to go," says Balaam, "I hope I'll go like that.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.680]   Let me die the death of the godly.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.520]   Let my latter end be as his."
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   What's it like then?
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:47.760]   Well, let Psalm 37, which we read at the beginning, answer the question, "Mark the perfect man
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:59.600]   and behold the righteous, for the end of that man is peace."
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.280]   Yes David the Psalmist, you see, old man by now.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.280]   "I have been young and now I'm old and I've observed certain things," he says, and this
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.040]   is one of the things he emphasizes.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.800]   "I've seen the ungodly like the green bay tree.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:21.520]   Flawless, successful man, suddenly he's gone."
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:27.120]   On the other end he says, "I've seen some godly and righteous people."
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.840]   And he says, "If you'll take the advice of an old man, it is this, 'Mark the perfect man
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.360]   and keep your eye, as it were, behold the righteous.'"
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   Why?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.760]   "Well," he says, "for the end of that man is peace."
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:49.320]   "Oh," says David, "I've watched people dying and you know these righteous people, they've
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.480]   got an amazing way of dying.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.960]   As John Wesley put it many centuries later, "Our people die well."
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.240]   You know my friend, there's nothing more important than the way in which a man dies.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:06.000]   He either dies in his sins or in the Lord and if he dies in the Lord, oh, it's an end of
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   peace.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.320]   What do you mean?" says someone.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.360]   "Well, I mean something like this, you see.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:22.000]   The man who dies in the Lord, the Christian, when he dies, is not taken by surprise.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.760]   You can't be a Christian without thinking about death.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.360]   It's because a man has thought about death that he becomes a Christian.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.440]   If he hadn't thought about death and judgment, he'd never have believed in Christ.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.000]   That's why he believes in him.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.320]   He wants to be saved from destruction, damnation.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.120]   He's thought about death, so when death comes, he's not surprised.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.980]   He isn't taken unawares.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.200]   It doesn't suddenly come to him without his knowing.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.120]   No, no, he's prepared for it.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.080]   He's read the Old Testament which says, "Prepare to meet thy God."
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.560]   He's been concerned about this latter end.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.400]   He's thought a great deal about it.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.680]   He's always reminding himself that he's only a temporary person in this world.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.120]   He says, "The Scriptures tell me that I'm a stranger and a pilgrim.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   I don't belong here.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.520]   Heaven is my home.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.360]   Our citizenship is in heaven."
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.200]   And he says, "I've heard a preacher pronouncing a benediction every Sunday night."
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.600]   He says, "Our short and certain life and earthly pilgrimage."
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.080]   He always makes us remember that we are dying men and that we may die at any moment.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.040]   I'm ready for it.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.400]   You see, it makes a difference.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:43.360]   But not only that, if you are interested in these modes or in this question of the mechanism
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.040]   of death, I've got something very wonderful to tell you.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.600]   The ungodly men, the men who's not a Christian, when he dies, he's left alone, I say.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.840]   Nobody helps him.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   And he doesn't know what to do.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   He doesn't understand.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.880]   And there he is, bewildered and alarmed.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.600]   He's dying alone in his sins.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.480]   You know, a Christian doesn't die like that.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.160]   Our Lord's authority I have for saying it.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.960]   He puts it like this, you know, in that parable of Diobese and Lazarus.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.160]   He tells us when this godly pauper, Lazarus, came to die.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.840]   You know what happened?
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.160]   We are told about the rich man.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.760]   He died and was buried.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.280]   Not so Lazarus.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:33.760]   He was carried by the angels into Abram's bosom.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.000]   What a wonderful thing it is to die like that.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.800]   At this critical moment that never comes again, the blessed angels of God are there and they're
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   carrying you.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.120]   They're round and about you.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   They're underneath you.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   They protect.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:57.240]   He was carried into Abram's bosom.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:05.000]   Oh, there's a vast difference between dying in your sins and dying in the Lord.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.260]   This Christian knows that he sinned.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.000]   Of course he knows it much better than the other men.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.040]   And perhaps on his deathbed his sins come back to him.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.040]   But he's not terrified.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.480]   He's not alarmed.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   Why not?
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:26.720]   Well, he knows that though he has sinned, he has already passed from judgment into life.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.640]   He knows that it is true to say God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.200]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.280]   Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:50.160]   He dying, knowing that he sinned, nevertheless is able to sing, "Jesus, thy blood and righteousness,
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:58.280]   my beauty, O my glorious dress, midst flaming worlds, in this arrayed with joy shall I lift
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:02.880]   up my head."
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.280]   He knows that he is forgiven.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:14.080]   He knows that his sins have been blotted out as a thick cloud because he knows that Jesus
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.120]   Christ, the Son of God, the He who said that he was the light of the world, had died for
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.880]   his sins, had taken his punishment, that God was reconciled, and he forgiven, absolutely,
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:33.160]   no condemnation.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.400]   He is not alone, I say.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:47.600]   Not only are the angels carrying him, he has another companion.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.680]   The devil may be there attacking him and reminding him of his past, raking up his past sins and
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.080]   transgressions.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.000]   He is not alarmed, he is not terrified.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Why?
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:07.680]   Because he is able to address this appeal to someone who is there.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:15.160]   "Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:23.240]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed be of sin the double cure.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:35.040]   Cleanse me from its guilt and power while I draw this fleeting breath.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:43.800]   When mine eyes shall close in death, when I soar through tracts unknown, see thee on
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.720]   thy judgment throne.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:55.560]   Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:08.560]   When I tread the verge of Jordan, bid my anxious fear subside, death of death and hell's destruction,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:15.920]   lend me safe on Canaan's side.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:25.760]   Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes, point through the gloom, lead through the
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.600]   gloom and point me to the skies.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:36.800]   Heaven's mourning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:45.960]   O thou who changest not, abide with me."
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.120]   He is not alone.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:54.800]   The one who has been with him in life is with him in death, assuring him that he has covered
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.400]   him with his blood, that he'll never let him go, that he'll never leave him nor forsake
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   him.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:09.800]   In life, in death, he's with him and will be and beyond.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   He hears a voice addressing him from the other side and saying, "Come, ye blessed of the
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:24.600]   Lord, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.880]   Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   But is he fit?
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   Yes, he is.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:37.800]   Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:49.040]   Before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, clothed with the righteousness of Christ,
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:53:01.360]   held by the hand by Christ, ushered into the presence of God in glory indescribable, seeing
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:15.680]   him as he is and being made like unto him and entering into the joy of the Lord.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:21.240]   Can you imagine a greater contrast?
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:28.560]   At the risk of being misunderstood, I say it, what's it matter whether you're dying
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.800]   as the result of a bum or old age?
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.480]   What's it matter what it is that kills you?
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.800]   It's your soul that matters.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.720]   Are you in your sins or are you in the Lord?
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.320]   That's the one thing that matters.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:52.240]   Have you ever faced that?
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:54:01.200]   If you are in the Lord and in Christ, you will be able to say with the apostle Paul,
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:06.960]   "To me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   What is death?
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.000]   To be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.760]   Forever with the Lord, amen, so let it be.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:23.000]   Life from the dead is in that word, it is immortality.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.720]   Here in the body pent, absent from him I roam, but nightly move my moving tent, a day's
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:39.440]   march nearer home.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:47.360]   My dear friend, have you ever considered this?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.640]   This is why you should look at and listen to this Son of God, this light of the world.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.760]   That's the difference it's going to make to you.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:02.040]   It will make a difference before that, but this is the final, the last, the inevitable.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:09.240]   How are you going to die?
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.960]   It is one or the other.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.400]   There is no third possibility.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:24.760]   You either will die in your sins, unknowing what you are doing, terrified and alarmed
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:34.880]   and bewildered, realizing your error and realizing your eternal misery, or else the angels, the
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:43.120]   Christ, the crossing of the little brook, the sound from heaven, the voices from glory,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:50.200]   the Father welcoming you, the Christ presenting you, the glory which is everlasting and indescribable.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:54.160]   Oh, my friend, have you ever considered this?
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.720]   What you think of Christ is not a matter of opinion.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.440]   It's going to help you there.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.760]   It's going to make all the difference at that most vital, urgent, tragic point.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:10.720]   Do you die in your sins, or do you die in the Lord?
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.880]   Don't you see the wisdom of this gospel?
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:21.080]   Don't be interested in the myriad of your death.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:29.360]   Concentrate only on the state of your soul, and as to whether you are going to die in
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:35.440]   your sins or die in the Lord.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   That's it.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.960]   Are you in your sins now?
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.640]   Well, if you are, I say, fly to Him.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.280]   Believe on Him now.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.800]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.600]   Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth me and accepteth my words hath everlasting
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:56.940]   life and has passed from judgment through death unto life.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.760]   You can make sure of it now.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.120]   There is no need to delay.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.000]   You can settle it at this moment.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.360]   Come out of your sins.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.360]   Get into Christ.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.680]   The rock of ages is split.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.160]   It's open before you.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.840]   Fly to Him.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:18.680]   Turn to Him now and say, "Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to thy bosom fly, while the
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.880]   nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:28.080]   Hide me, O my Saviour, hide, till the storm of life is past.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.320]   Safe into the heaven guide.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.000]   O receive my soul at last."
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.160]   Say that to Him now, and you'll settle it.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.160]   You'll be saved.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.640]   You'll no longer be in your sins, and you'll no longer die in your sins.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.680]   You'll be in Christ, and you'll die in the Lord.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.040]   And blessed are they that die in the Lord.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:54.320]   Their works do follow them, and the glory, the everlasting glory awaits them.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.600]   Make certain of it.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.600]   Make certain of it now.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.880]   Amen.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:16.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 477, 477.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.080]   Rock of ages cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:29.120]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed be of sin the double cure.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.240]   Save me from its guilt and power.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.240]   477.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:59:03.240]   Rock of ages cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed be of sin the double cure.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:49.520]   Amen.
