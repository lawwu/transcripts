[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.480]   Paul's epistle to the Philippians in the third chapter, reading verses 20 and 21.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.720]   Last two verses in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Philippians.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.560]   For our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.800]   Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:51.520]   body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.520]   Now in those words the Apostle brings to an end and to a grand climax the series of things
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.320]   that he's been telling us right through this chapter.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.760]   And what he has been doing, as I've reminded you several Sunday evenings, to give us an
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.840]   account of what it rarely and truly means to be a Christian.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.960]   The Apostle writes to these Philippians, as he tells them, because it was the only safe
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.600]   thing for them.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.640]   Even in the days of the early church there were false ideas, current, as to what exactly
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.840]   made a man a Christian.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.400]   And so some of these members of the early church were being troubled and confused.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.560]   And it is because of that that the Apostle writes to them, and as he says, he's having
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.760]   to write things that he's already told them, things he's already written to them about.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.240]   He doesn't object to that.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   To write the same things to you, to me indeed, is not grievous, but for you it is safe.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.840]   The one thing that decides our destiny in time and in eternity is this gospel.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.560]   If we're wrong about this, well then our whole eternal future is going to be wrong.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.720]   If we're right about this, well then our whole future, eternal future, is right and
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   is safe.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.880]   I am calling attention to the message of this chapter for the tenth time.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.920]   We've been working our way through it, as most of you know.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.680]   And my reason for doing that is precisely the same as animated the great Apostle.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.800]   We are living in such desperate times.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.200]   We are all aware of that.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.560]   The world has never been more confused, life has never been more uncertain than it is at
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   the present time.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.400]   Of course, life is always uncertain and always has been uncertain.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.720]   But there is, as everybody must agree, at the present time, a new element.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.000]   And the new element is, of course, that the entire world may come to an end as the result
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.280]   of this tremendous and frightening and alarming power that man now has in his hands.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.640]   And therefore, surely, we all must agree with this.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.360]   The most urgent matter confronting us all is simply this.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.520]   What of our unknown and eternal future?
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.840]   How are we to face the possible end of everything?
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.440]   We can't stop the process, we can't contract out of life.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   We are all involved in it and we are all moving with it.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.720]   What if the end should come?
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   What then?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.280]   Now that surely is the first and the greatest question.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.880]   And it's the question that is alone answered by the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.840]   message of this book which we call the Bible.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.960]   And so the Apostle has been giving us his definition of what it is that makes a man
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   a Christian.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.680]   And so for certain whether we are Christian, that's the question.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.320]   There are false notions coming, false ideas.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.000]   People imagine they're all right, find later that they're not all right.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   How can we be sure?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   Well, he gives us a series of definitions and we've been examining them one by one
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.800]   and have been testing ourselves as we have proceeded.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.160]   And here in these two verses we have the last, the final test.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.880]   This is something, he says, that is true of the Christian.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.600]   Our conversation, that's in contradistinction to the people he has been talking about in
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.720]   verses 18 and 19.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.160]   This is what he says about them.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.200]   Many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.400]   enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.360]   whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.520]   But our conversation is in heaven.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   And so on.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.280]   Now we begin considering this last test supplied by the apostle last Sunday evening.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.400]   And what we saw then was this.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.560]   That when a man becomes a Christian he undergoes a very profound change.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.440]   The difference between the non-Christian and the Christian is not a small one, it's a
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   very big one.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.320]   It's as big as this.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   It's like a man moving or being moved from one continent, from one country to another.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.080]   He belonged to this world, he is now translated into the kingdom of God.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.240]   Nothing is bigger than that.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.120]   And then we went on to say that we must always think of ourselves as Christians in terms
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.420]   of belonging to kingdoms.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.560]   As I say, by nature we all belong to the kingdom of the devil, the kingdom of this world, the
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.600]   kingdoms that are passing.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   But what makes us Christian is that we belong to the kingdom of God.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.920]   What God's doing in this world is to form a new kingdom.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.720]   He's calling people out of the other, putting them into this.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.680]   He's preparing for that future age which will be inhabited by his people.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.240]   Our citizenship is in heaven, says Paul.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.520]   We are still on earth, but we don't belong to it.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.340]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.560]   We belong there.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.160]   We are citizens of that kingdom.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.720]   And we ended by considering some of the great characteristics of this kingdom, and especially
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.640]   emphasised the points and the ways in which it differs from every other kingdom.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.680]   Very well.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.120]   Now we proceed this evening to show this.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.200]   That in the light of that, it's quite obvious and inevitable that the Christian's outlook
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.360]   is entirely changed.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.040]   That's something that is said repeatedly in this New Testament.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.360]   If any man be in Christ as this same apostle to the Corinthians, he's a new creature,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.280]   he's a new creation.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   What's the effect of that?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.960]   Well, all things are passed away.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.040]   Behold all things are become new.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.440]   He's like a man in a new world, in a new realm, in a new kingdom.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.920]   And everything is seen in a different manner.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.360]   Now then, I want to show you how the apostle tells us that in these two verses.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:20.600]   "Our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.400]   Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:35.800]   body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   Now then, what's the teaching?
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.720]   Let me put it to you in the form of three propositions.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   Let us first of all look at the Christian's view of life in this world as it is.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.160]   Now this is to me a most important matter for this reason.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:04.200]   I would hazard the opinion that at the present time, in present circumstances, this is the
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.400]   most crucial test that all of us can apply to ourselves to determine whether we are Christians
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   or not.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.320]   What is our view of life in this world at this moment?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.400]   What is our view of ourselves living in this world at this present hour?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:32.120]   A man's view of the world as it is at this moment will tell us exactly whether he is
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.480]   a Christian or whether he isn't.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.040]   I say that for this reason.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.200]   There is no point at which the Christian view in general differs so much from every other
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.980]   view as just at this point.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.200]   And I want to show you the ways in which it does differ.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.920]   Now there are many people, of course, who don't stop to think about life at all.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.640]   All they want is happiness and so-called pleasure.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.880]   They don't sit down and think, they don't ask what's going to happen, they don't
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.440]   stop to ask why are things happening at all.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.840]   They just refuse to think.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.760]   Their philosophy is, "Let us eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die."
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   And there it is.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.480]   They have no view whatsoever.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:21.120]   Well, that of course is altogether and entirely different from the Christian's attitude.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.440]   But I want to show this.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.040]   That taking the natural men at his very best and highest, we will find that his view of
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.960]   life as it is at this moment is altogether and entirely different from that of the Christian.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.240]   Now I'm so concerned about this because I think it's just here that there is the
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:50.440]   greatest amount of misunderstanding of what Christianity is at this present juncture.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.480]   There are many good people in the world tonight who think that they're truly Christian,
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.360]   and they think they're truly Christian because of the view they take of this world, and because
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.320]   of what they think should be done in this world and what should be done to this world.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   I just want to try to show that their view is entirely different from the Christian view.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.520]   That's where the confusion comes in.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.920]   There is this terrible misunderstanding as to what Christianity is, what it says and
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.160]   what it proposes to do.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.840]   And it is mainly, I say, with regard to the condition of this world and what can be done
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   about it.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.440]   There are many good people tonight who regard themselves as Christian, who believe that
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   the first business of Christians is to do something to put this world right, to save
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.360]   it and to reform it and to put it right as it's meant to be.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.400]   And that they regard as Christianity.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.280]   Now then let's see how that contrasts entirely and utterly and radically with the teaching
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.640]   of the apostle in these two verses and everywhere else in all his writings.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.480]   And indeed not only his, but the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ himself and all others
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   who have ever written.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.160]   Look at it like this.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.400]   Here's Paul in the midst of this world, in the midst of life.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.280]   And this is what he says.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.680]   Our citizenship is in him.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.840]   Very well, what's he telling us?
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.120]   Well the first thing he tells us is this.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:23.840]   That in a real sense he no longer belongs to this world.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.040]   To use the expression, he is still in it, but he's not of it.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.000]   Now that's a fundamental point, isn't it?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.280]   All of us by nature are not only in the world, we are of the world.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   As I was trying to show last Sunday night, we are governed by its outlook, by its mind,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.520]   by its cause, by its outlook and mentality.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.760]   We are of the world.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.520]   We think as the world does.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.440]   We do what the world does.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.280]   We are utter worldlings, good and bad, all mixed up, but we're all worldlings.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.880]   Our outlook is confined to time and to space and entirely to this world.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.300]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, that's no longer true of him.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.160]   These other people, as the apostle says, they mind, they think of, they dream about, they
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   imagine about other worldly things.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.760]   They mind earthly things.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.400]   But the Christian doesn't.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   Something's happened to him.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.080]   He's been brought out of it.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   He's in another realm.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   And though physically he's still in this world, he has this tremendous consciousness that
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.920]   he no longer is of this world.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.200]   There is such a profound change taking place in him, that in his mentality and his thinking
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.400]   and his dreaming and his whole outlook, he's no longer of this world.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.080]   He belongs to that other world, that heavenly, that spiritual, that unseen realm.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.000]   That's the first thing he tells us.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.680]   But the second thing that he knows is this, that this world is but a passing world.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.920]   That's the most difficult thing for any man to realize.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.840]   The world seems so solid, doesn't it?
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.520]   And it's such an old world.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.960]   You remember the man who wrote his poem?
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.440]   The world was very old indeed when you and I were young.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   Quite right.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.960]   And because of that, you see, we tend to think that this world is eternal, that this world
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   is everything.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.200]   The solidity of the mountains, as things always have been, so they are.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.920]   We come and go, but the old world, on it goes.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.560]   And we tend to think, therefore, that this is a durable world, a lasting world, and the
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.480]   only world.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, he has his eyes opened to that utter and complete
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.440]   fallacy.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.280]   This is a passing world.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.560]   This is a world on a very definite time limit.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.680]   That's the biblical teaching from beginning to end.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.160]   There was a time when there wasn't a world.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.040]   In the beginning, God created.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.560]   The world starts.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.440]   God sets it going.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.600]   But equally certainly, there is an end.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   There is a limit.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.660]   The whole Bible looks forward to this end.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.560]   So this is a passing world.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.120]   Now that's the great biblical message from beginning to end.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.960]   But this is not the real world.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.480]   This is a world of shadows.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.880]   There's nothing certain here.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.800]   The only world that is certain is that which is to come.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.000]   Our conversation is, as I pointed out last Sunday night, that is, means, has its fixed
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   location.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.840]   You see, this is a world of shadows, not the world of substance.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.040]   Change and decay in all around I see.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.080]   Your great eternal mountains, they're not eternal.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   There's something happening to them all.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   They're all crumbling.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360]   There's a great change.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.120]   Everything is changing in nature.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   It's not as durable when you really come to accept change and decay in all around I see.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.440]   It's a moving, it's a passing, it's a transient, it's a temporary world.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.560]   The Christian knows that.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.600]   And obviously it makes a profound difference to him.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.680]   So then I go to my third point, and this is the crucial one.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:19.760]   Knowing that about this world, the Christian expects nothing from it.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.360]   Now then, here you see is the great dividing line.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.240]   The other man talks like this.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.280]   He talks about the advance and the development and the improvements.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.720]   He is always looking forward to some great day that's coming when all problems will be
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.860]   solved and utopia will have arrived.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.140]   He believes that.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.000]   He believes it quite honestly and quite sincerely.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.840]   It's not a question of sincerity.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.480]   It's a question of what is right and what is wrong.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.360]   So this man believing in that has his hopes fixed upon this world and he expects great
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.020]   things from it.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.840]   Now this has been particularly the case for the last hundred years or perhaps by now a
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.200]   hundred and fifty years.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.280]   The great characteristic of man's thinking, especially since about 1859, Charles Darwin
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.320]   and his famous book and all that accompanied it, this has been the controlling and the
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.160]   favorite teaching.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:21.240]   That man is just about to come into his own and that we've got a glorious prospect ahead
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   of us.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.560]   And many people calling themselves Christian adopted that view and began to propagate it.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.300]   Some of us in this congregation are old enough to remember a time when we used to hear endless
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.080]   sermons on the notion of bringing in the kingdom of God.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.740]   That was the great theme of Edwardianism.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.680]   It was the great theme right up until 1914.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.800]   It was the favorite theme in the Christian church, bringing in the kingdom of God.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.600]   You brought it in by legislation, by acts of parliament.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.720]   The world was going to be made a better place.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:59.560]   We were going to punish war and all troubles and we were going to bring in a kind of paradise.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:07.720]   I was reading only the other day a book by a man, a Christian man in America, actually
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.440]   writing on this very epistle to the Philippians, in which he said he was writing in the early
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.000]   days of the First World War that our business was to make earth like heaven.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.960]   And that's how he interprets the words we are looking at tonight.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.440]   You see that was the whole notion and idea, that the world was to be rid of its problems
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.400]   and the expected great things to come.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.360]   The point I am establishing is that that is the very opposite and antithesis of what the
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.440]   great apostle tells us here.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.560]   The New Testament expects nothing at all from this world.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.560]   Why?
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.400]   Well, the answer is quite simple.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.760]   This world is a world that is dominated by the devil.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.800]   He is the god of this world.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.760]   He is the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.760]   of disobedience.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.280]   So that while the devil is controlled and while there is sin in the human heart, "When
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.200]   come wars amongst you?" asks the New Testament, and it answers the question by saying, "Even
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.280]   of your own lusts, there are wars in your members."
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.640]   And while this is true of mankind, you can't have a perfect world.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:28.560]   So the Christian looking out upon it all doesn't expect anything from it.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.680]   And therefore, he knows perfectly well that the most that can be done by civilization
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:42.480]   is simply to control up to a point the ravages of sin and of evil.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.800]   You see, the Christian is not a man who believes in doing nothing, but he is a man who realizes
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.760]   that there is a very definite limit to what you can do.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.520]   The tragedy of the last hundred years and the tragedy of so many tonight is this.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.920]   They say, "Give the people education, give them knowledge, give them learning, show them
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.960]   the evil effects of alcohol, evil effects of tobacco, evil effects of war, instruct
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.600]   them, teach them, and they'll stop doing these things."
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.040]   That's been the fallacy.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.120]   They believe, you see, that by our educational and cultural agencies we really can put the
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.280]   world right.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   We can banish all the things that get us into trouble, we can introduce a millennium, and
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.960]   we can live in a kind of paradise.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.200]   They believe it and they believe it very sincerely.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.760]   The Bible here tells us it cannot be done.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.080]   Is there no point, you see, therefore, in education and culture and all these things?
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   Yes, there is.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.760]   But this is their value, and this is the very totality of their value.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.920]   All they can do is to control the problem.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.800]   They can't solve it.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.640]   They can mitigate many wrongs and remove many injustices.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.880]   They can make life very much more comfortable in many ways, but they can't touch the real,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.920]   the radical problem.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.240]   They can give us better houses, they can give us better medicine, they can give us better
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.640]   hospitals, they can make us all live longer, but can they make us live better?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.220]   Go and ask the Home Secretary.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.360]   Ask him the latest figures for his juvenile delinquency.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.200]   Ask him about the condition of the jails in this twentieth century.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.000]   Now you see, modern life is confirming the biblical teaching.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.880]   The Christian holding this view and saying our citizenship is in heaven is a man who
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.480]   says I expect nothing of this world.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.600]   I know that while the devil is in control and sin and evil and lust are dominant in
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.240]   human nature and personality, that there will be troubles.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.520]   There will be wars and rumors of wars, as Christ said.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.760]   It's bound to be the case.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.640]   What's inside a man must express itself.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.720]   So that I put it lastly in this form.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.600]   The Christian is not a bit surprised that things are as they are in this world tonight.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.860]   And this is a tremendously important point.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.440]   The only man who's not surprised at the state of the world tonight is the Christian.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.520]   All the others can't understand it, they're bewildered, and many of them are honest enough
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.560]   to admit it.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.320]   They can't understand why things are terrible as they are at this moment in view of their
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.120]   own theories and their own hopes and their own belief in what men can do.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.960]   But the Christian is not a bit surprised.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.720]   The Christian, you see, believes this book, which is a book of history as well as a book
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   of the teaching of God.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:44.840]   And he knows that at the very beginning when men lived in paradise, he went wrong and brought
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.680]   trouble upon himself.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:54.520]   He sees all the striving of men to get rid of the problem of evil, but he sees him failing.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.880]   He knows that the story of history is this.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.040]   It's a sort of periodicity.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.800]   Things seem to be getting better and the world is hopeful and people say, "At last, it's
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   come.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   Suddenly there's a crash."
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.600]   Now, how can people be so blind to the plain teaching of this history in this very century
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.440]   in which we live?
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.760]   Who anticipated the war of 1914, 1918?
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.760]   Who imagined it?
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.600]   No, no, they were all confident.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.120]   At last we bid farewell to those things.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.880]   The world couldn't be made perfect.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.320]   It's going to be made perfect.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.480]   It is being made perfect, they said.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   And suddenly the calamity comes upon us.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.400]   The Christian wasn't surprised.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.240]   The Christian says, "I read that sort of thing many times in the Bible."
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.000]   He says, "That's the state of the world and will be as long as the devil is in control,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.760]   as long as men and women are rebels against God, as long as they put their own wills before
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.040]   God's will and go their way instead of his way."
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.440]   It's bound to be.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   It's inevitable.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.600]   Educate a man, if you like, that doesn't always make him a sober man.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.680]   Educate a man that doesn't stop him being an adulterer.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:10.960]   These were the leaders in adultery and these things at the beginning of this century.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.440]   Now you see the Christian has got an entirely new view.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.920]   He looks out upon this same world as everybody else, but that's how he sees it.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.000]   He says, "I'm still in it, but I don't belong to it.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.240]   Thank God I've had my eyes opened.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   I'm out of it.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.640]   I'm in it in physical form.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.400]   I'm out of it.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.960]   I don't expect anything of it."
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.280]   "Well, do you go away from it?"
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   "No, no, I don't.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.480]   I believe in controlling evil," he says.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.640]   "I believe in law.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   I believe in order.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.080]   I believe in trying to educate people.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.720]   I believe in anything that can put a curb or a control upon sin and evil, but I don't
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.120]   expect them to make men perfect.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.640]   I know they'll never reform the world.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.920]   I know they'll never get rid of the basic problems."
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.160]   It is Christ himself who said, "There shall be wars and rumors of wars."
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.840]   He pictures a terrible picture.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   He says, "When the Son of Man is come, shall he find faith on the earth."
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   Very well.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:09.880]   That is the Christian's view of life in this world as the result of this teaching which
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.360]   he has believed.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.540]   That brings me to my second question, therefore, which is this.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:23.200]   The Christian's hope while he is in this world.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.560]   Now I think the order of these things is most important.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   That's his view of it.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.440]   Well, how does he live in it?
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.840]   Well, he's got a hope.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.360]   The Christian's hope while he is in this world.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:41.440]   The point I'm emphasizing is this, that the Christian is not hopeless.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.400]   The Christian is not really pessimistic.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   He is realistic.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.120]   "Dear me, sir, someone, is that your view of life in this world?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.080]   Do you just stand up and say the whole thing's hopeless?
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.520]   The world can never be put right.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.120]   The world can never be reformed.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.800]   The world can never be rid of war and its troubles.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   Isn't that sheer pessimism?"
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.480]   No, no, that's realism.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.720]   The Christian is realistic.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.660]   I venture to suggest that he is the only man who is realistic.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.420]   The Christian never wears rose-colored spectacles.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.640]   This is the most honest book in the world.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.240]   It looks at a man and tells him the truth about himself.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   Everybody else is praising us.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.560]   The papers praise us.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.680]   The philosophers praise us.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.240]   You've got it in you to do this and that.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.880]   The Bible comes to us and says, "You haven't.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   You're as rotten as this.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.640]   You've got to be born again.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.240]   You need to undergo this profound regeneration."
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.920]   That's the Christian.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   That's realism.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   That's honesty.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.980]   It faces the facts as they are.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.980]   It doesn't blink at them.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.240]   It doesn't try to change them.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   It doesn't try to cover.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.120]   No, no, it says, "There is life."
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.840]   But that isn't pessimism.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:56.400]   The Christian, far from being a pessimist, is a profound optimist.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.480]   Because he does see a hope.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.840]   And he is the only man who has any hope in this world tonight.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:08.240]   Now then, I'm issuing this as a challenge.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.960]   What hope is there in this world at this minute, apart from the message of this Gospel?
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.800]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.200]   What's the world got to offer you?
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.840]   Oh, meeting of statesmen.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.280]   But they've been meeting for years.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   International conferences.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.640]   Haven't we had so many of them that we can no longer count them or even remember where
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   they were held?
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   Educate the people.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.400]   Well, we've done it very thoroughly in the last hundred years.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.080]   Get the people to meet with one another where they've been meeting one another.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.880]   And the more they meet with one another, the more they quarrel.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.120]   What has the world got to offer us a hope this evening?
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.680]   It has nothing to offer us except that which has been tried and tried very thoroughly throughout
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   the whole history of civilization.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.880]   It is literally hopeless.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:04.160]   The world tonight is without hope because it is without God.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.840]   There is literally only one hope for us at this very minute.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   What is it?
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.800]   Well, here it is.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:24.240]   Our citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.000]   who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.760]   according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.960]   My dear friend, it's the only hope at this moment.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.080]   If I didn't believe this, I wouldn't be in this pulpit.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.520]   It is literally the only hope, but it's the Christian hope.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.160]   Let me unfound it to you.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   What is the hope?
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   It's this.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:53.960]   The coming of the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, again into this world.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.000]   Now, here is essential Christianity.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.240]   You see, everything about Christianity always depends upon him.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   These people who preach a vague idealism as if it were Christianity and who don't mention
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.000]   the name of Jesus Christ, they're the enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.560]   There's no Christianity without him.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.480]   Don't you notice how the apostle goes on mentioning his name?
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.640]   He seems to like to say, "Lord Jesus Christ," and he says it again and again and again in
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   all his epistles.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   Why?
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.960]   Well, there is no Christianity apart from him.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   He is the Saviour.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.920]   It's always in him.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.240]   Everything is in him.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.500]   Everything is done by him.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.580]   Look at these glorious terms.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:46.320]   We look for the Saviour, the Deliverer.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.760]   That's his name, Christ the Messiah.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.880]   You see, he is the only Saviour, and everything he does is to the intent that we may be saved,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.240]   that we may be made safe.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.040]   Why did he ever come into this world?
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.680]   Why was he born as a baby in Bethlehem?
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.200]   The answer is, he's the Saviour.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   The world was lost.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.560]   That's what he said, wasn't it?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.600]   The Son of Man, he says, has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.400]   Why did the Son of God ever leave the courts of heaven and come down on earth?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   Why?
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.420]   There's only one answer.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.760]   It was the only way whereby a single soul could be saved, the only way whereby the world
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760]   can be saved.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:30.640]   He is the Saviour, and everything he does and says is to this end of salvation, deliverance,
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.200]   putting us into a place of safety.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.920]   The Saviour.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:44.120]   And the Saviour is the Lord, the Lord of glory, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.520]   the everlasting Son of God.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:51.800]   This is this great romance, this great dramatic incident, the Son of God comes into the world.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.480]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.960]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.840]   You see, it's because the world doesn't know what this means, that it's not Christian tonight,
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.560]   and that's why the people are deriding it and turning the other way and saying it's
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   got nothing to do with us.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.080]   They don't realize what's happening.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   This is not a teaching.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.560]   This is something that's happened.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.880]   God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.400]   When the fullness of the dimes was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.640]   under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.480]   That's it.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   The Saviour.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.160]   And the Saviour is the Lord.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.400]   And the Lord is Jesus.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.520]   Here's the Christian message you see.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.600]   Forget your philosophies, forget your ideologies, forget even Christian teaching as such.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.440]   Realize that this is the message.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.520]   This person, this blessed person, this Jesus of Nazareth, the babe of Bethlehem, the boy
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.240]   arguing in the temple, the carpenter, the one who began to preach at the age of thirty.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   Who is he?
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   The Lord of glory.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.920]   He's come down into the world.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   What for?
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.320]   Because he's the Saviour.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.800]   And he alone can save.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.920]   But there he is dying on that cross on Galilee's hill.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.760]   Does that mean he's a failure?
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   No, no.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760]   That's how he saves.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:20.000]   Nowhere does he stand out so gloriously as the Saviour is on that cross.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.360]   There he is bearing in his own body the sins of men, taking unto himself our iniquities
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.480]   and God smiting them in him.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   The Saviour, the Saviour as he's born, the Saviour as he teaches, the Saviour especially
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.080]   as he dies.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.640]   But can he do anything about death?
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.760]   Yes, he rises triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:47.640]   The Saviour from the grave, from death, from hell, the Saviour from everything.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.280]   The Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.200]   But wait a minute.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.680]   The point the apostle makes in our verses tonight is this, that all that I've hitherto
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.240]   mentioned is not the end of the story.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.920]   The work of the Saviour is not yet finished.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   Let's be clear about this.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.640]   He's already done enough to save us from hell.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:24.400]   By dying on that cross on that tree, he has reconciled us to God.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.960]   That's all right, my friend.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.080]   In that sense the work is already finished and complete.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.400]   But looking at it from a bigger and a wider sense, his work is not complete.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:41.760]   We says the apostle, our conversation is in him, from whence also we look for the Saviour.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.840]   This same person, born of a babe, the man who taught, the man who was crucified, the
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   man who died and was buried, the one who rose again, manifested himself unto his disciples,
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.240]   ascended into heaven, took his place at the right hand of God in the glory, he, that same
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.360]   Saviour, that same person, is coming again into this world.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.800]   We look for the Saviour.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.440]   This is an essential part of the teaching.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.160]   Now what does he tell us?
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.840]   Now it's only as we understand this that we really can ever hope in this world as it
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.880]   is this evening.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.800]   There is literally no other.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:28.920]   Is there anybody who is foolish enough still to expect world improvement or world reform?
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:35.080]   Is there anybody listening to me who still thinks that men can solve this problem?
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.960]   Well the answer of the Bible is this, they can't.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.880]   There's only going to be one end to history and the end will be the coming again of this
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.240]   same Saviour.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.600]   We look for his coming.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   The whole of the New Testament is looking.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.080]   It ends by saying, "Even so, come Lord Jesus."
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.320]   What's it mean?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.440]   Well let me try and give it to you in a number of headings.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.520]   It's this.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:02.320]   Let me emphasize first of all the fact that he is going to come.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.640]   You remember how after his resurrection and after he'd spoken to his disciples and others
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:14.600]   for forty days, he took them out to a mountain outside Jerusalem and he spoke to them and
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.160]   gave them certain last instructions.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:24.600]   And then I read this, "And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.400]   up and a cloud received him out of their sight.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.960]   And while they looked," that's to say the disciples, "while they looked steadfastly
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.800]   towards heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, which
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.520]   also said, 'Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.200]   This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.600]   ye have seen him go into heaven.'"
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.440]   That's the whole thing.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.440]   What's it mean?
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.160]   Well I say what it means is this, that as certainly as he came the first time as the
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.440]   babe of Bethlehem, he's going to come again into this world.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.640]   That's the teaching of the apostle.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.480]   It was the teaching of the Lord himself.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   How will he come?
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.720]   Well he will come visibly, in like manner.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   He will become visible.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.560]   He will come in bodily form.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.520]   It will be possible to see him.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.360]   Yes but he won't come as the babe in Bethlehem.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.000]   He won't come as a helpless babe.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   How will he come?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.400]   Well he will come in his glorious body.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.240]   He will come in his glorified body.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.120]   You see when he was here in this world he had a body like you and I have, but in that
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.960]   amazing fact of the resurrection his body was changed.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.400]   It was a glorified body.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.560]   He could come in with the door shut and suddenly appear.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.040]   There was something strange and different.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.360]   Paul saw him on the road to Damascus and the glory was shining and indescribable.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.840]   He'll come in a body of glory.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:03.440]   He will come riding the clouds of heaven accompanied by myriads of holy angels and he will appear
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.120]   in that manner.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.400]   What will he do?
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.720]   Why is he coming again?
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.820]   Why does the apostle say that he was looking for this and that all true Christians look
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.820]   for this?
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.820]   Well what will he do?
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:21.800]   The answer is he will exert his power.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.040]   He will come again into this world in order to judge it.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.320]   You remember this apostle preaching to the Stoics and the Epicureans, the great philosophers
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.600]   of the city of Athens?
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.040]   He said God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:44.880]   that men whom he hath appointed whereof he hath given us assurance in that he hath raised
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.380]   him from the dead.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.920]   The Lord Jesus Christ is coming back into this world in order to judge it.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.720]   He said himself that the Father had committed the judgment unto him.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.820]   You see this is the whole point about this world.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.820]   This world is under judgment.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.820]   It's already under judgment.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.720]   God has already said so.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.680]   The law of God is perfectly plain.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.000]   Those who rebel against him are under his wrath.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Those who believe in him in Christ, they are saved, they are delivered, they are pardoned,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.680]   they are forgiven, they are translated into his kingdom.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   But the world refuses.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.200]   The world turns away from him.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:20.400]   So the world is under judgment and he is coming back to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.680]   Here is the tragedy of this hour.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.560]   The world goes on complacently.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.560]   Think how it's spending its Sunday today.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.360]   Is it worshipping God and singing his praise?
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   Is it thinking of the wonders of his grace in his dear son, our blessed Lord and Savior?
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.160]   Of course it isn't.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.040]   It laughs at that sort of thing.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.480]   They think that's very funny, that's a real joke, that people should still be doing that
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   in the mid-20th century.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   What's it doing?
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.880]   Eating, drinking, enjoying itself, having a good time.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.440]   Troubled now and again by the news and by the newspaper.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.880]   Wondering what's going to happen, then trying to brush it aside.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.320]   It doesn't know that it's under judgment and that as certainly as we are here at this moment,
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.640]   the Son of God is going to come back into this world to judge it in righteousness.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   What do you mean by that, Sir Simon?
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.040]   The Apostle puts it here like this.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.880]   "Who shall change this hour-vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:25.960]   body according to the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.080]   Notice this word "working".
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   According to the working.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.400]   What's he talking about?
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.560]   Well, he's talking about his power.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.080]   When he comes, he'll not only come in his glory, and his glory will be manifested and
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.920]   every eye shall see him, but he'll come in tremendous power.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.800]   He won't come as the helpless babe and be put into the manger.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.320]   He will come according to the working.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.960]   This is energy put into operation.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.560]   The energy is there, but he'll manifest it.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   He'll show it.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.560]   It'll exude from him.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.760]   It'll be put into operation.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.880]   The energy of his power.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.380]   Well, what does he do with the energy of his power?
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.880]   And the answer is, he will subdue all things unto himself.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.040]   What an interesting word this word "subdue" is.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.040]   Listen to its meaning.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   Here it is.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.800]   It's a military word.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:23.040]   It means to arrange things under one's authority.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.200]   The idea in this word translated "subdue" is this.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:32.120]   It's that of a general arranging his regiment in an orderly manner.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.240]   Subdue.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.920]   Everyone in line, everyone in order.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.640]   No man running here and another there, and stragglers here.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   Everything in order.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.240]   The general has ordered marshalling all things under one's power.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.760]   That's the meaning of "subdue."
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.440]   And what the greater puzzle tells us is this, that when he comes again, he'll come in his
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:02.440]   glorious power, and he will come to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.120]   Everything is not subdued to him at this moment.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.440]   Arrogant atheistic nations are blaspheming his name.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.000]   Clever people in this country are doing the same thing.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   You're materialists.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.360]   You're people who live for this world and who mind earthly things.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.360]   Christ is an oath.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   They are not subdued.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   They're all fighting him.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   They're all laughing at him.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:26.080]   They're spitting, and everybody's fighting for himself, and the world is in confusion.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   There's no order.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   There's no arrangement.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.600]   But he is coming.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:37.720]   And when he comes, he will act and behave as a great general does, who has the power
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.200]   and the authority to put everything in order.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.720]   If a man disobeys, he's struck down.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.680]   Everything is subdued.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.760]   Every enemy is vanquished.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.920]   Every foe is conquered.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.960]   Every rebel is brought to book and brought to order.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.000]   Every high thing that exalts itself against him is smashed to the ground.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.600]   That's what he's going to do.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   And he can do it with all things, remember.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:17.360]   Listen to the scriptures stating this wonderful truth.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.400]   This apostle has already told it to these, the Philippians, in the second chapter.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   Listen.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.000]   "Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.720]   that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow."
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   Your infidels, your skeptics, your materialists, your communists, all men who've defied him,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.800]   every knee shall bow.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   Everybody subdued.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.120]   "Of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.680]   tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.440]   Everything in this whole universe that has fought against him is going to be quelled,
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   is going to be subdued.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.560]   It will have to be ordered, and it will be ordered.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.080]   "At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.880]   Jesus shall reign.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:19.280]   For the one we are expecting as God is, who is like a flame of fire, he is one who the
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.720]   blast of the breath of whose nostrils will sweep out of existence everything that is
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   opposed to him.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.520]   He will come conquering and to conquer."
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:35.240]   Did you notice how the apostle put it in those words that we read at the beginning out of
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.720]   the second epistle to the Thessalonians?
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.000]   Let me remind you of them.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.240]   Listen to this in the first chapter.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:52.080]   God promises, he says, "Rest to you who are troubled, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:58.920]   from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:04.440]   God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.640]   destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, when he shall
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:17.040]   come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe in that
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.920]   day."
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.440]   And listen to him again in the second chapter of that same epistle.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.560]   "Let no man deceive you," he says, "by any means, for that day shall not come, except
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.080]   there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition."
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.240]   You see, the fact that most of the world tonight is not Christian shouldn't surprise the Christian.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   It's been prophesied.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.520]   There's to be a great apostasy before he comes again.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.160]   The world in its cleverness will think it's ruined Christianity and laughed it out of
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   court.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   A great falling away.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   It's coming.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.400]   We're in the midst of it, I believe.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.880]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.400]   "That man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.840]   above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he as God sits in the temple of God,
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:06.240]   showing himself that he is God."
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.440]   All this has been foretold, but wait a bit.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:15.880]   "Then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:22.360]   his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, even him whose coming is after
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.320]   the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders."
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.640]   And the world's full of it today.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:31.520]   Man in his cleverness, splitting the atom, working miracles apparently, controlling the
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.520]   very elements.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.320]   Man the great God.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.720]   And the moment this Christ will come, the flame of his eyes will defy it all.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   It'll become nothing.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.000]   It'll be utterly subdued.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.480]   And with all deceivable of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.560]   the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.880]   And for this cause, God will send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.120]   And the world is believing the lie tonight, believing the lie about Christ, the lie about
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:05.440]   God, the lie about this world, the lie about his second coming, the lie about the end of
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   the world.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:11.120]   The world in its delusion is believing the lie.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.080]   But it doesn't make any difference.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.680]   The world can't prevent his coming.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.840]   He will come, and at the brightness of his appearing, all this will be dissolved.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.360]   And subdued.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.200]   And he will reign from shore to shore.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   That's the program, that's the hope.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.040]   That's why the Christian is not a pessimist.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.600]   He sees the world going from bad to worse.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   It's all right, he says.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   I'm expecting it.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   It's going to get much worse yet.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.720]   There's going to be indescribable confusion.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.520]   And men in their arrogance will blaspheme the name of God.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.320]   And when we think the end has come, Christ will come.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.400]   And all the enemies will be destroyed.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.800]   But the Christian has got a particular reason for looking for this.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.440]   And this is the wonderful thing.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.080]   He'll not only do all that, he's going to do something to us individually.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.600]   What does all this mean to the Christian?
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.960]   Well, here is what it means.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.000]   Those who are here regularly will remember that as I was interpreting verse 11, I said
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.840]   I'd deal with it again.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:14.520]   Paul says that his ambition is this, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:20.480]   and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, if by any
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.640]   means I might attain unto the resurrection from among the dead.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   What's that?
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.640]   Well, here it is.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:35.840]   Who shall change this, the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned and formed like unto
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:41.800]   the body of his glorification, whereby he is, according to the working, whereby he is
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.040]   able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:50.440]   Thank God the working of his power is not only going to quell and subdue his enemies,
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.160]   it's going to do a marvellous thing in me.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   What is it?
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.840]   It's going to change this old body of mine.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.880]   This the body of my humiliation.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.040]   I am a Christian.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.240]   I am no longer of this world.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.800]   I belong to the city which is in him.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.440]   My citizenship is in him.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   But I'm still in this world.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.280]   Yes, and I have lots of troubles in it.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   Why?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   Well, partly because I'm in this old body.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.840]   It's the body of my humiliation.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.240]   The body that is weak and frail and subject to illnesses and all sorts of weaknesses.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.200]   All this is the result of the fall and the sin of men.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   But here I am.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.200]   My soul is saved.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   My body is still unsaved.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.800]   And not only that, sin dwells in my body still.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.480]   The principle of evil has not been taken out of my body.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   It's still here.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.640]   And there's a fight and a struggle.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.200]   I'm in the body of my humiliation.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.200]   And it means that I groan in this tabernacle.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.000]   But thank God I can look forward to this blessed hope.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.040]   When he comes, he'll not only subdue all his enemies.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:59.920]   He's got enough power even to make this body of mine to be subdued unto him.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.000]   He's got power to change my body of humiliation and to fashion it like unto the body of his
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   own glorification.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   What's that?
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.600]   Well, you see, it's this.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.640]   The natural body is a body of flesh and blood.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.920]   But that other body is not a body of flesh and blood.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   It's a body of flesh and bones.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.520]   Do you remember how when he came to his disciples after his resurrection, in the body of his
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.800]   glorification, he didn't say, "You see that I've got flesh and blood."
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   He didn't say that.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   He said, "You see, I've got flesh and bones."
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.720]   A spirit, he says, "I've got flesh and bones as you see me here."
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.840]   No longer blood, but flesh and bones.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:40.120]   A glorified body, a beautiful body, a body that has no weakness, no sin, no blemish,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.000]   no longer subject to disease.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.320]   A pure body, a body like his body.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:53.080]   So that John says, "When he doth appear, we shall see him as he is, and we shall be
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   like him."
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:59.680]   "Oh," says the apostle, "our citizenship is in him.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   We don't mind earthly things.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.640]   We don't think for this world any longer.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.440]   We are not looking forward to some marvelous good time that's coming on earth."
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.920]   "No, no, I'm looking for his coming," says Paul, "because I know it's the only
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.680]   thing that can save me finally.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.400]   It will save my body as well as my soul.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   It will save everything.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.160]   He'll destroy all his enemies.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.440]   He'll get evil right out of the cosmos, and he'll bring in the new Jerusalem.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.760]   There shall be new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, and we shall dwell
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.840]   in it with him and bask in the sunshine of his face."
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.360]   Very well.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.920]   That's the Christian's hope while he's in this world.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   Lastly just a word.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.040]   How then does he live in this world?
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.600]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:45.720]   "From whence also we look for, we look for the Saviour."
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.560]   It's a wonderful word, this word "look for."
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.360]   Do you know what it means in the original?
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:58.160]   It's the word used about a wife whose husband has had to go away from home on business,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.440]   and he's been away for some time, but the moment has arrived when he's due to come
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   home.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.800]   And there she is standing on the doorstep, she's been peeping through the window, waiting,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   is he about to come?
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.280]   And there she rushes, "Look for!"
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:15.520]   "From whence also we look for the Saviour."
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.080]   The Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.360]   It's a composite word, this.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.320]   It means readiness to receive, yes, but it also means this.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.240]   It means, you see, that we've withdrawn our attention from everything else.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:31.720]   That woman who's waiting for her dear husband, she isn't looking at the television, she's
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.760]   not looking at the newspaper, she isn't almost prepared not to look at her children.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.040]   She's looking at the window, looking to see, standing on the doorstep, looking, withdraws
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.000]   from everything else, concentrates on this, waits for this, the great moment, the arrival
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   of the beloved.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.400]   That's my position as a Christian, says the Apostle.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:56.600]   An intense, yearning, eager waiting, with attention withdrawn from everything else.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.520]   That's the meaning of "look for the Saviour."
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.840]   The Christian is a man, you see, who goes through this world.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:13.400]   He does his best in it, to make it as good as he can.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.560]   I'm not describing the Christian as a man who becomes a hermit and says, "Let the world
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   go to the devil."
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.560]   No, no.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.480]   He engages in politics, he believes in education, and all these things, not because he's going
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.280]   to make a perfect world, but to try and keep evil within limits, no more.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.920]   And he's not surprised when he fails.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.520]   He knows that this present age is an age of failure.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   Why?
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.760]   Because it's turned its back upon God, because it thinks it can get on without God.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.360]   And he knows it's going to get worse.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.240]   He is not disappointed, as I say, but he does his utmost, but he doesn't pin his faith in
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   that.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.240]   No, no.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.600]   He's looking for the Saviour.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.880]   He says, "I'm but a stranger here, heaven is my home."
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.160]   He's a man who says, "And nightly pitch my moving tent."
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:00.720]   A day's march nearer home.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.200]   He's not a man who expects anything in this world.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.520]   He knows that nothing can suffice him.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.080]   But this wonderful, this glorious thing that is going to happen when the Son of God appears
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.400]   again, he knows that then war's going to be banished.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.440]   There shall be no more sorrow, no more sin, no more sighing, no more parting, no more
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   shame.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.120]   Nothing unclean shall be in that new Jerusalem, that heavenly kingdom that's coming, that
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.840]   Christ is going to bring in.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:34.480]   He knows that it's going to be a life of glory, and he's looking for it, he's waiting for
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.000]   it.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.120]   And especially for this change in his body.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.480]   Let me close, therefore, by reading to you what this same apostle has put still more
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.720]   magnificently and at greater length in the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   15, beginning to read at verse 50.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.920]   Now this I say, brethren, listen.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   This I say, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.240]   You'll never get the kingdom of God in this world as it is now.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.360]   Flesh and blood can't live in it, it can't inherit it.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.720]   Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.280]   How can you have a perfect world while we're all corrupt, while we're all creatures of
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.800]   lust and passion and desire, and have this evil body of humiliation?
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.220]   It's impossible.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.560]   Corruption cannot inherit incorruption.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:31.080]   But behold, listen, I'll show you a mystery.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:40.320]   We shall not all sleep, we're not all going to die, but we shall all be changed in a moment,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.680]   in the twinkling of an eye, at that last trump.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:49.640]   For the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.920]   These are the Christian dead, only remember, this is the resurrection out from among the
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   dead.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.520]   These are the people who are going to live, not the people who are going to everlasting
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   destruction.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.520]   These are going to live.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:06.720]   The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:13.400]   For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality before
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.560]   we can dwell in the kingdom of God.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.540]   So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:26.160]   on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, "Death is swallowed
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   up in victory."
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.840]   Oh, death, where is thy sting, O grave?
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.000]   Where is thy victory?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.640]   The sting of death is sin.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.160]   That's the thing that troubles us about death.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.720]   That's the thing that causes death.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:42.880]   Sin, evil, lust, desire, passion, this thing that's made the world, the shambles that it
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:47.440]   is and the hell that it is, the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.320]   But thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:55:02.080]   Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:09.840]   the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.600]   In the Lord is all right.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:19.040]   If you believe in him and in his message and are trusting yourself to him and are waiting
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.280]   for his blessed, glorious coming, it's all right.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.800]   Let the heathen rage, let the people of Egypt in vain think, let the kings of the earth
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   set themselves together.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:33.160]   God will say from heaven and has said it, "I have set my king on my holy mount of Zion.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:38.640]   He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh."
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:45.720]   Look for his appearing, look for his coming, the blessed appearing of our great God and
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:52.280]   Saviour, the routing and the destruction and the subduing of everything that is opposed
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.200]   to him.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:04.840]   And the beginning of his glorious and eternal reign.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.560]   That's the Christian.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   Is that you?
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:16.520]   How do you view life in this world tonight?
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.680]   What are you expecting from this world?
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.200]   Where is your hope?
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.720]   What are you living for?
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.840]   What are you living by?
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.360]   Which is it?
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.280]   This is the Christian message.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:40.720]   Not world reform, but the coming of the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the dwelling in
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:48.720]   the light of his glorious presence forever and forever.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.740]   Amen.
