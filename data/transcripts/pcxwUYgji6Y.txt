[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740]   Pastor John, here's a very common question that we get emailed to us by friends who listen
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.000]   into this podcast, and it usually goes something like this.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840]   "I don't like to read, period, and it has nothing to do with the Bible.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   I just don't like to read.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.400]   How do I stay motivated, then, to read on a daily basis?"
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:32.080]   Let's start this way, six very short and I hope very obvious statements that have huge
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.520]   implications about reading.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.240]   Number one, the Bible is a book.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.480]   Number two, it is inspired by God.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:50.520]   Number three, it is all true and profitable for our faith, our salvation, our holiness.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.680]   Number four, it lies dormant and useless unless it is read.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.560]   Reading is the only key that unlocks writing, even inspired writing.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.880]   Five, therefore, we must have this message either by our own reading or through the reading
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.600]   of another.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.960]   Six, so if we do not read, and millions, of course, can't read, quite apart from whether
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.760]   you want to or not, millions can't read yet, they're pre-literate.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.800]   Even if we do not read or can't read, then we must avail ourselves of others' reading,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.000]   namely by live or recorded reading of the Word.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.200]   So this is probably why Paul said to Timothy in 1 Timothy 4.12, "Until I come, devote yourself
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.840]   to the reading of Scripture."
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.640]   Now, almost all the translations say "public reading of Scripture," and that's probably
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   right.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.360]   Paul is telling Timothy, "Be sure the Scriptures are read every gathering.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.480]   Devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching."
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:29.600]   Many, probably, among the new believers, perhaps couldn't read, yet they were dependent on
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.040]   the reading.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.080]   So today, we can listen.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.920]   For example, the ESV study Bible, I was just using it the other day at the gym.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   I just clicked on it.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.960]   The ESV study Bible has a little part to its app that can tell you to read what you're
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   looking at.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.920]   It reads it to you, and the reading is good.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.040]   I like this guy, the way he reads to me.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.840]   And it scrolls as you read, so you can let him do the reading while you actually look
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.800]   at the words.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   So that's my compromise answer to the question.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:16.520]   The Word of God going into our minds and hearts day and night is essential.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.640]   Psalm 1, "Meditate on the law of the Lord day and night."
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.200]   It's essential if we're going to be like trees planted by water when the desert winds are
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.620]   blowing from all around us.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.200]   So if you can't bring yourself to read, then by all means, listen to the Word of God every
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   day.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.400]   Now, before I quit, I've got to ask a few questions to our friend.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:51.480]   God might use these questions to stir you up to more freely and joyfully make the effort
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   to read.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.080]   So here are my questions.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.480]   Number one, have you seriously considered that God himself has appointed reading as
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.960]   the way to know the mystery of Christ?
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.600]   That God himself, no fluke of history, no conspiracy of intellectuals, but God himself
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.000]   decided that it should be so.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.120]   Ephesians 3, 3 and 4, "The mystery was made known to me," the apostle says, "by revelation,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720]   and I have written briefly."
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.640]   By reading this, it's a participle, by reading this, you can perceive my insight into the
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.000]   mystery of Christ.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.680]   That's amazing.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.080]   God has appointed reading as a pathway into the mystery of the living Christ.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080]   Wow.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.480]   Number two, here's a second question.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.700]   Have you considered there are millions of people around the world, and there have been
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.720]   millions in history, that would have given almost anything if someone would teach them
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.920]   how to read.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   They have intuited that not being able to read makes a person a blind man in a world
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.960]   of light.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.880]   In other words, have you thought seriously what gift you have?
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.920]   You probably got it in the third grade.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:24.440]   What gift you have that you simply can read, a gift that many would almost die to have.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.720]   Number three, third question, have you considered that the greatness of what you read really
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.920]   can turn reading into a pleasure, even for those who don't like the act of reading
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   itself?
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.760]   For example, let me illustrate.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.280]   Would you enjoy reading a letter that begins, "Dear sir, you are the beneficiary of a
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   million-dollar inheritance.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280]   Please read on."
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   Seriously.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   What would happen to your pleasure factor in reading?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.580]   Or here's another question.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.720]   Would you find pleasure in reading a note from your doctor telling you your surgery
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.760]   was completely successful, the cancer is entirely removed, and the likelihood of it returning
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.160]   is virtually zero?
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.840]   How would you feel as you read on through the paragraph?
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   Would reading be a burden?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.920]   Would you find pleasure in reading a letter from your long-alienated son telling you that
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.840]   he has trusted in Christ and would like to come home?
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.720]   Would that be a burden to read the rest of that letter?
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.600]   Would you enjoy reading an affidavit from your attorney explaining that the legal suit
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.840]   against you and your business has been dropped?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.920]   Would that be a burden?
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.280]   Would you find pleasure in reading that letter?
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.600]   In other words, it is possible that if you saw enough glory, enough beauty, enough thrilling
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.360]   news in what you were reading, that you would have the motivation to do it with joy.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.800]   And lastly, I would ask, have you prayed?
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.400]   Have you asked for the illumination and motivation that you need?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   But I'll end where I began.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.360]   I don't want to make it impossible.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.800]   I'll end where I began.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:25.240]   Don't let your disinclination to read stop you from taking the Word of God in.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.280]   Listen with your phone in the bathroom.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   Listen in the car.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.640]   Listen when exercising.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.680]   Listen, listen, listen.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.280]   Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.720]   Those are some great motivations for reading in general.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.800]   And if you struggle to read the Bible in particular, which is not an uncommon problem, see also
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   episode number 438, which is titled "Six Tips If You Find the Bible Hard to Read."
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.540]   That's in the podcast archive.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.280]   We turn our attention to prayer next week and welcome a special guest to the podcast,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.360]   Tim Keller.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.880]   You may have heard of him, and you may know that he has a book on prayer releasing soon.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.520]   So I've gathered up 10 questions on prayer.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.200]   We'll get him on the phone, and I'll ask him rapid fire.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.720]   And if everything works right, I'll ask him two questions in each of the five podcasts
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.280]   next week, beginning on Monday.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   It should be fun.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.200]   I'll start by asking him to explain what our prayerlessness says about us, and then I'll
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.840]   ask him how he learned to pray by using the prayers of the Psalms.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.120]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   [END]
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120]   1.
