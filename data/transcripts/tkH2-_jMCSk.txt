[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.180]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.020]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.820]   Today, we are going to discuss the science
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.740]   and practice of flexibility and stretching.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.000]   Flexibility and stretching are topics that I believe
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.340]   do not receive nearly as much attention as they deserve.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.680]   For most people, the topics of flexibility and stretching
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.080]   bring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.000]   or maybe even contortionism.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.300]   But it turns out that flexibility and stretching
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.060]   are features that are built into our basic body plan.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.240]   Young children, young animals, and adults,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.840]   and indeed older children and animals,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.640]   all stretch and all have some degree of flexibility.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.460]   It turns out that having flexibility
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.120]   and our ability to stretch,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.140]   and the interaction between stretching and flexibility,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.700]   are fundamental to how we move,
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.940]   our ability to learn new movements,
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.140]   indeed also to prevent injury or repair injuries,
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.080]   and to offsetting and reducing inflammation
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.920]   throughout the body.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.500]   In fact, today I'm going to share with you
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.580]   a remarkable set of studies that show
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940]   that stretching can actually adjust things
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.580]   like tumor growth.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.720]   This is work that was done by one of the major directors
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.620]   of the National Institutes of Health.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.060]   So today's discussion will start with a description
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.860]   of the mechanisms, literally the cells
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.620]   and the connections from your nervous system
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.920]   that mediate flexibility and stretching.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620]   And I promise that I'll make that information
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.940]   accessible to you,
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.820]   whether or not you have a biology background or not.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.660]   Then with that information in hand,
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.600]   I'm going to present to you
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.100]   what the scientific literature says
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.980]   about the best times and ways to stretch.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.260]   Everything right down to the detail
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.180]   of how long to hold a stretch,
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.600]   whether or not to hold a stretch at all,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.180]   because it turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.380]   So you can imagine you have stretches
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.060]   where you hold the stretch for a very long time
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.140]   and use as little momentum as possible.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.460]   And then there's also what's called
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.920]   dynamic and ballistic stretching,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.740]   where you're literally swinging your limbs,
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.660]   trying to increase the range of motion.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.120]   I will explain the science and application of flexibility
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.300]   and stretching in the context of sports performance,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.900]   whether or not you're engaging in cardiovascular exercise
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.420]   or resistance exercise or both,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.920]   whether or not you're a competitive athlete
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.360]   or simply a recreational exerciser, as I am,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.580]   whether or not you are trying to increase
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.520]   your range of motion and flexibility for longevity purposes,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040]   or whether or not you're trying to do it
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.700]   in order to access different parts of your nervous system,
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.360]   'cause we'll soon learn today
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.480]   that your ability to improve flexibility
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.960]   and the need to engage in specific stretching exercises
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.780]   can actually be used to powerfully modulate your ability
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.320]   to tolerate pain, both emotional and physical pain.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.000]   So this thing that we call flexibility and stretching
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.760]   is actually a vast landscape.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.400]   We're going to simplify and organize all that for you today.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.080]   And by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.960]   you're going to have a number of simple,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.860]   easy-to-apply tools that are grounded
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.440]   in the best scientific research
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.040]   that you can apply for your specific goals.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.840]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.740]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.900]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.840]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.140]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.620]   to the general public.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.520]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.200]   Thesis makes custom nootropics
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.980]   that are designed to get your brain and body
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.280]   into the optimal state for the cognitive
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.640]   and physical things that you need to perform
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.260]   at the highest level.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.480]   I have to confess, in fact, I've said it many times before,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.240]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.160]   because it means smart drugs.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.360]   And frankly, as a neuroscientist,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.120]   I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.740]   that there's really no circuit in your brain
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.760]   for being smart.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.800]   You have neural circuits in your brain
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.020]   that are designed to get you to focus very well
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.440]   or to task switch very well or to be creative.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.660]   Thesis understands this, and as a consequence,
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.700]   they've designed nootropics that are tailored
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.160]   to your specific needs in the cognitive and physical realm.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.920]   What I mean by that is if you go to the Thesis site,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.440]   you fill out a short quiz,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.060]   and they'll give you the opportunity to try a small kit
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.280]   of different nootropics with different ingredients.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.000]   You have the opportunity to try several different blends
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.980]   over the course of the month
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.760]   and discover which nootropics work best
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.460]   for your unique brain chemistry and genetics.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.360]   I've been using Thesis for about eight and a half months now
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.260]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.200]   have been a game changer.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.180]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.700]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.260]   There you'll find that three minute quiz
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.080]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.200]   to try in your first month.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.600]   That's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.440]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.720]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.460]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.180]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.760]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.920]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.720]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.240]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.800]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.120]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.880]   is that you get information back about hormone levels,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.040]   metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.000]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.020]   Inside Tracker has a very easy to use personalized platform
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.840]   that lets you look at those numbers
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.080]   and then you can literally move your cursor
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.520]   over those numbers and there are little pop-up windows
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   that will tell you the things that you can do
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.220]   in terms of lifestyle, so exercise and nutrition,
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.440]   supplementation and so on to bring those numbers
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.640]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.560]   So it really takes all the guesswork out of what to do
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.640]   with that blood work and DNA information.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.080]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.640]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.680]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.320]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.040]   Again, just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.880]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.620]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.480]   that have cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.240]   And indeed you can dial in,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.560]   you can literally program the temperature
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.080]   of your sleeping environment from the time you go to sleep
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.280]   until the time you wake up in the morning.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.240]   This turns out to be immensely powerful
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.880]   because as I've talked about on the podcast before,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.360]   in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.620]   throughout the night,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.040]   your body has to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.280]   and waking up in the morning actually involves a warming up
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.120]   of your body temperature.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.000]   For many people, they just can't precisely control
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.360]   their sleep environment well enough
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   in order for all that to go well.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.340]   I was one such person.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.920]   So for a long time, I'd fall asleep pretty easily,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.900]   but then I'd wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.360]   I tended to run warm,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.720]   but then sometimes I'd feel really tired in the morning
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.320]   as if I couldn't wake up.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.720]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.320]   I programmed it so that the temperature would be rather cool
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.640]   in the early part of the evening when I would get into bed
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.360]   and then would drop into the deeper phases of the night
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.240]   when I was entering deep sleep
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.320]   and then wrap an eye movement sleep
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.920]   and then would warm towards morning.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.120]   It would help me wake up quickly.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.760]   And as a consequence, I'm sleeping throughout the night now
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.140]   and I'm waking up feeling completely refreshed.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.140]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.960]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.400]   to check out the ProPod cover

[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.480]   Let's talk about flexibility and stretching.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.240]   Before we talk about the practices
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.100]   of flexibility and stretching,
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.800]   I'd like to just highlight some of the features
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.040]   that are already built into your nervous system
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.560]   and into your body that allow you to be flexible.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.880]   Some of us feel tighter than others,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.960]   sometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.400]   Some people feel really loose and limber.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.740]   Some people even have what's called a hyper flexibility.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.380]   I, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.400]   and bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.060]   And it always makes me cringe a little bit,
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.460]   but she can do that without any pain.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.520]   She seems to have some hyper flexibility in her joints.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.280]   I do not have that feature.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.120]   Some of you may find that you are more flexible
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.480]   than others naturally.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.440]   And some of you might be thinking,
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.920]   you don't need to build in additional flexibility.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.640]   Well, I think by the end of today's episode,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.240]   you'll realize that almost all of us can benefit
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   from having some sort of understanding about flexibility
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.380]   and having some stretching protocol
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.400]   that we incorporate into our life,
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.520]   if not just for physical performance reasons
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.020]   and for postural reasons,
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.560]   then also for cognitive and mental reasons.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.080]   And I'll be sure to clarify what all of that means.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.240]   Right now, I'd like to take a moment
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.380]   and just highlight the flexibility that you already have.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.420]   For instance, if you were to move your arm
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.320]   behind your torso a little bit and then sort of let go
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.560]   or stop exerting any effort in doing that,
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.960]   you would find that the limb would return more or less
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.300]   to a position next to your torso, at least I would hope so.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.440]   Now, why is that?
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.020]   Well, it turns out that there are aspects
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.160]   of your nervous system, aspects of your skeletal system,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.120]   aspects of your muscles and aspects of the connective tissue
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.680]   that binds all of that together,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.520]   that try and restore a particular order or position
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.260]   to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.540]   So that reflects a very specific set of processes
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.080]   that it turns out are the same set of processes
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.400]   that you use when you are trying
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.120]   to enhance flexibility and stretching.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.800]   So I'd like to just take a moment
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   and review the basic elements of nervous system, muscle,
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.620]   connective tissue, and skeletal tissue, bone,
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.020]   that allow for flexibility and stretching.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.840]   And here we can point to two major mechanisms
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.520]   by which your nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve cells,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.500]   communicate with muscles,
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.200]   and those muscles communicate back to your nervous system
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.840]   to make sure that your limbs don't stretch too far,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.500]   they don't move too far such that you get injured.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.680]   And in addition to that,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.800]   mechanisms that ensure that you don't overload your muscles
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.040]   too much with weight or with tension or with effort
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.660]   and damage them that way.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.800]   Because it turns out that the second security mechanism
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.920]   of making sure that you don't overload muscles
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.960]   can be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.640]   almost immediately.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.700]   That's right, there are protocols and tools
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.420]   that I'll share with you that are going to allow you
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.960]   to vastly improve your flexibility over time,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.740]   but there are also mechanisms that allow you
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.880]   to quite significantly increase your degree of flexibility
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.380]   in a very short period of time, within just a few seconds.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.400]   So let's establish some of the basic biological mechanisms.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.920]   In time we talk about biology or physiology,
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.520]   we're going to talk about structure,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.200]   meaning the cells and their connections,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.300]   and functions, what they do.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.900]   They're just a few names to understand,
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.240]   you do not have to memorize these names.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.080]   The important thing that I'd like you to know
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.560]   is that flexibility and the process of stretching
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.780]   and getting more flexible involves three major components,
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.180]   neural, meaning of the nervous system,
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.280]   muscular, muscles, and connective tissue.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.860]   Connective tissue is the stuff that surrounds
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.420]   the neural stuff and the muscular stuff,
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.080]   although it's all kind of weaved together
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.340]   and braided together in complicated ways.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.980]   Some of you may have heard of fascia,
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.720]   we're going to talk a little bit about fascia today,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.980]   although it's such an interesting tissue
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.860]   that's really deserving of its own episode.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.980]   Facial tissue, we're going to talk about
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.920]   some of the stuff that surrounds muscles
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.380]   that really gives you your shape
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.680]   and holds everything together
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.440]   and allows for flexibility to occur.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.700]   So here's a key thing that everyone should know,
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.120]   whether or not you're talking about flexibility or not.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.200]   Your nervous system controls your muscles,
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.740]   it's what gets your muscles to contract.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.280]   So within your spinal cord,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.900]   you have a category of neurons, nerve cells,
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.940]   that are called motor neurons.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.160]   To be precise, they are lower motor neurons
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.480]   'cause they're in your spinal cord.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.040]   We call them lower to distinguish them
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.680]   from the motor neurons that are in your brain
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.880]   up in your skull.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.940]   Those lower motor neurons,
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.820]   hereafter, I'll just refer to them as motor neurons.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.660]   If I want to talk about the other kind of motor neurons,
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.700]   I'll say upper motor neurons.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.760]   So if I say motor neurons,
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.860]   I just mean the ones in your spinal cord.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.220]   Those motor neurons send a little wire
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.020]   or set of wires out to your muscles,
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.380]   and that creates what's called a neuromuscular junction,
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.340]   which just means that the neurons meet the muscles
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.880]   at a particular place.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.880]   Those neurons release a chemical.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.860]   That chemical is called acetylcholine.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.080]   Some of you may have heard about acetylcholine before.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.620]   Acetylcholine also exists in your brain
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.100]   and does other things in your brain,
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.160]   mainly it's involved in focus and attention,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.180]   but at the neuromuscular junction,
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.140]   the release of acetylcholine from these nerve cells,
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.980]   these neurons onto the muscles,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.820]   causes the muscles to contract.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.380]   And when muscles contract,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.380]   they are able to move limbs by way of changing the length
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.060]   of the muscle, adjusting the function of connective tissue,
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.580]   like tendons and ligaments.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.640]   And for instance,
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.020]   if you're bringing your wrist closer to your shoulder,
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.180]   that biceps muscle is contracting, it's getting shorter.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.660]   I mean, in reality, it hasn't gotten shorter overall.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.140]   It's just temporarily shorter, of course.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.920]   All of that is controlled by neurons.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.720]   And it's those motor neurons from the spinal cord
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   that are really responsible for the major movement
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.460]   of your limbs by way of causing contraction
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.620]   of specific muscles at specific times.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.980]   So the key thing to take away
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.360]   is that nerve controls the contraction of muscles.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.420]   Now, within the muscles themselves,
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.300]   there are nerve connections.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.400]   And these are nerve connections that arise
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.500]   from a different set of neurons in the spinal cord
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.740]   that we call sensory neurons.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.340]   The sensory neurons exist in a different part
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.960]   of the spinal cord, and they send a little wire
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.060]   or set of wires into the muscles.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.840]   And there's a particular kind of sensory neuron
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.420]   that comes out of your spinal cord and into your muscles,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.860]   which are called spindle neurons.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.380]   They create, or they actually wrap around muscle fibers,
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.020]   kind of corkscrew around them.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.120]   They give kind of a spring-like appearance.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.140]   If for you aficionados out there,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.780]   these are intrafusal connections or neurons,
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.040]   intrafusal means within the muscle,
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.820]   but you really don't need to know that
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.740]   unless you're really curious about it,
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.060]   or you're going to become a neuroscientist,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.340]   or you're in medical school or something.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.820]   These spindle connections within the muscle
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.580]   that wrap around the muscle fibers
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.780]   sense the stretch of those muscle fibers.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.260]   So now we have two parts to the system that I've described.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.100]   You've got motor neurons that can cause muscles to contract
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.040]   and shorten, and we have these spindles
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.180]   within the muscles themselves
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.240]   that wrap around the muscle fibers,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.180]   and that information is sent from the muscle
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.140]   back to the spinal cord.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.740]   It's a form of sensing what's going on in the muscle,
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.100]   much in the same way that you have neurons in your eye
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.940]   that sense light in your external environment.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.860]   You have neurons in your ear that sense sound waves
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.300]   in your external environment.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.720]   You have neurons in your spinal cord
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.780]   that are sensory neurons that are sensing
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.540]   the amount of stretch in the muscles.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.080]   What happens is if a given muscle is stretching really far,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.860]   those sensory neurons, those spindles within the muscle
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.820]   will activate and will send a electrical potential,
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.780]   literally a bit of electricity along that wire's length
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.140]   into the spinal cord, and then within the spinal cord,
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.480]   that sensory neuron communicates
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.120]   through a series of intermediate steps,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.180]   but to the motor neuron
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.180]   and make sure that that motor neuron contracts.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.680]   Now, why would that be useful?
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.220]   Well, what this does is it creates a situation
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.580]   where if a muscle is stretching too much
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.760]   because the range of motion of a limb is increased too much,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.120]   then the muscle will contract to bring that limb range
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.740]   of motion into a safe range again.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.140]   Now, what determines whether or not a range of motion
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.120]   is "safe" or not is dictated by a number of things.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.720]   It's dictated by things that are happening
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   in this kind of loop of neural connections
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.160]   in the spinal cord and muscle.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.400]   It's also determined by what's going on in your head,
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.120]   literally in your mind, cognitively,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.640]   about whether or not the movement of that limb,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.420]   its increasing range of motion is good for you,
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.120]   whether or not you're doing it deliberately,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.140]   whether or not it's bad for you,
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.360]   and then there are also some basic safety mechanisms
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.200]   that are put in there that really try
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.800]   and restrict our limb range of motion.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.580]   Okay, so just to clarify,
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.040]   this whole thing looks like a loop,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.280]   and the essential components of the loop are
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.520]   motor neurons contract muscles,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.300]   sensory neurons,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.860]   of which there are a bunch of different varieties,
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.560]   in this case, what we're calling the spindles,
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.600]   are sensing stretch within the muscles,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.080]   and if a given muscle is elongating
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.760]   because of the increased range of motion of a limb,
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.080]   those sensory neurons send an electrical signal
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.580]   into the spinal cord such that there is an activation
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.680]   of the motor neuron, which by now should make perfect sense
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   as to why that's useful.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   It then shortens up the muscle.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.960]   It actually doesn't really shorten the muscle,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.280]   but contracts the muscle that brings the limb back
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.580]   into a safe range of motion, okay?
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.460]   So this process is very fast.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.920]   It was designed to keep your body together and safe.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.960]   It's designed to make sure that you don't, you know,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.820]   take your arm and swing it behind your torso,
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.940]   and it just goes all the way back
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.840]   to the middle of your back.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.100]   I mean, unless you're a contortionist,
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.560]   or you've trained that kind of level of flexibility,
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.060]   that would be terrible because it could provide
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.960]   a lot of damage to the muscles
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.880]   and to the connective tissue and so forth.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.400]   So that's one basic mechanism that we want to hold in mind,
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.520]   this idea of a spindle that senses stretch
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.480]   and can activate contraction of the muscles
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.760]   and shorten the muscles.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.640]   The next mechanism I want to describe,
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.360]   and once again, there are only two
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.320]   that you need to hold in mind for this episode,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.000]   this other mechanism has a lot of the same features
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.640]   as the one I just described,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.780]   but it has less to do with stretch.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.180]   In fact, it doesn't have to do with stretch
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.720]   as much as it has to do with sensing loads.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.520]   So at the end of each muscles, you have tendons typically,
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   and there are neurons that are closely associated
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.660]   with those tendons that are called Golgi tendon organs.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.400]   These are neurons that are sensory neurons
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.480]   that sense how much load is on a given muscle.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.920]   So if you're lifting up something very, very heavy,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.700]   these neurons are going to fire,
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.280]   meaning they're going to send electrical activity
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.640]   into the spinal cord.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.120]   And then those neurons have the ability to shut down,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.280]   not activate, but shut down motor neurons
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.800]   and to prevent the contraction of a given muscle.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.720]   So for instance, if you were to walk over
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.880]   and try and pick up a weight that is much too heavy for you,
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.440]   meaning you could not do it without injuring yourself
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   and you start to try and heave that weight off the ground,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.160]   there are a number of reasons why you might not be able
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.400]   to lift it, but let's say you start
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.940]   to get it a little bit off the ground,
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.360]   or you start to get some force generated
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.260]   that would allow it to move.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.480]   But the force that you're generating could potentially
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.920]   rip your muscles or your tendons off of the bone, right?
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.000]   That it could disrupt the joints and it could tear ligaments.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.720]   Well, you have a safety mechanism in place.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.240]   It's these Golgi tendon organs, these GTOs as they're called
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.600]   that get activated and shut down the motor neurons
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.040]   and make it impossible for those muscles to contract, okay?
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.720]   So on the one hand, we have a mechanism that senses stretch
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.800]   and can figure out when stretch is excessive.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.420]   And when the system detects that stretch is excessive,
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.340]   it activates the contraction of muscles.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.520]   And then we have a second mechanism that senses loads.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.140]   And when tension or loads is deemed excessive
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.460]   by these circuits, and remember,
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.440]   these circuits don't have a mind.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   They don't go, oh, this is excessive.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.200]   They just sense loads.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.620]   And when those loads exceed a certain threshold,
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.960]   well, then those GTOs, those Golgi tendon organs
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.820]   send signals into the spinal cord that shut down
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.280]   your motor neurons' ability to contract muscles
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.720]   so that you no longer can lift that heavy load.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.220]   So both of these are protective mechanisms,
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.160]   but both of these can be leveraged in a very logical way
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.500]   and in a very safe way in order to increase
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.200]   your limb range of motion.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.000]   So there are a couple of things I want to point out
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.040]   before going a little bit further
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.520]   into how your nervous system controls
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.240]   flexibility and stretching.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.960]   And those key points are the following.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.200]   There are now dozens, if not hundreds of studies
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.840]   that show that a dedicated stretching practice
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.200]   can improve limb range of motion.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.960]   Now, for many of you listening, you're probably saying duh,
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.280]   but I think it's important to point that out,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.200]   that a dedicated stretching practice
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.560]   can increase limb range of motion.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.440]   And as you'll soon learn, there are specific mechanisms
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.120]   that can explain that effect.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.600]   The second point is one of longevity.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.520]   And when I say longevity, I don't necessarily mean
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.300]   late stage aging.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.220]   We all undergo a decrease in limb range of motion
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.120]   unless we do something to offset that decrease.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.740]   And the current numbers vary from study to study,
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.580]   but if you look en masse, you look at all of those studies,
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.480]   and what you basically find is that we start to experience
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.660]   a decrease in flexibility from about age 20
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.520]   until about age 49, that's pretty dramatic.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.660]   And then of course it will continue after age 49,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.960]   but basically it's a 10% decrease every 10 years.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.720]   So we could say it's a 1% decrease per year,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.520]   although it's not necessarily linear.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.360]   What do I mean by that?
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.620]   Well, it's not necessarily that on your 21st birthday,
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.100]   you are 1% less flexible than you were
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.240]   on your 20th birthday and it decreased by 1% per year.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.160]   Some of these changes can be non-linear.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.020]   So you can imagine the person who's doing just fine
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.820]   in terms of flexibility between 20 and 30,
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.920]   and then, you know, they get to 32
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.220]   and suddenly they've lost 5% of their flexibility.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.760]   Now, of course, there will be a ton of lifestyle factors
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.560]   if you're a regular practitioner of yoga,
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.340]   if you have a dedicated stretching practice,
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.360]   if you're doing other things to improve
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.120]   your muscle contractibility,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.960]   so you're doing resistance training, it turns out,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.720]   can actually indirectly improve flexibility.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.360]   There are a number of different factors,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   but the key point is that maintaining some degree
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.020]   of flexibility and maybe even enhancing range of motion
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.660]   and flexibility is of immense benefit
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.700]   for offsetting injury provided it's not pushed too far.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.660]   There are a number of people who have pushed
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.300]   their limb range of motion so far
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.820]   that they experience all sorts of injuries,
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.500]   both acute and chronic injuries.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.420]   Today, we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.160]   Okay, so we've established that there are mechanisms
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.740]   within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.800]   Those, remember, it's the motor neurons, the spindles,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.360]   the GTOs, and of course, the muscles themselves,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.760]   and connective tissue, tendons,
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.180]   but also other forms of connective tissue
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.920]   that establish whether or not a limb is going to stay
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.900]   within a particular range of motion or not,
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.180]   and whether or not a limb is going to be allowed
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.800]   by the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.840]   a given tension.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.500]   There are also mechanisms that arrive
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.820]   to the neuromuscular system from higher up
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.120]   in the nervous system, from the brain,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.060]   and those mechanisms involve a couple of different facets
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.120]   that are really interesting,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.960]   and I think that we should all know about.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.680]   In fact, today, I'm going to teach you about a set
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.480]   of neurons that I'm guessing 99.9% of you have never heard
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.920]   of, including all you neuroscientists out there,
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.420]   if you're out there, and I know you're out there,
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.540]   that seem uniquely enriched in humans
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.260]   and probably perform essential roles
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.440]   in our ability to regulate our physiology
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.040]   and our emotional state.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.320]   So within the brain, we have the ability to sense things
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   in the external world, something we call exteroception,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   and we have the ability to sense things
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.120]   in our internal world, within our body,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.540]   called interoception.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.340]   Interoception can be the volume of food in your gut,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.400]   whether or not you're experiencing any organ pain
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.760]   or discomfort, whether or not you feel good in your gut
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.600]   and in your organs.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.800]   That's actually kind of feeling, I feel great,
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.920]   I feel sated, I feel relaxed,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.980]   but those are all different forms of interoception.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.440]   The main brain area that's associated
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.520]   with interpreting what's going on in our body
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.220]   is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.780]   It's a very interesting brain region.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.140]   It's got two major parts.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:29.140]   The front of it is mainly concerned with things like smell
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.160]   and to some extent, vision, and to some extent,
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.180]   other things that are arriving from the external world
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.000]   and combining with what's going on internally
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.120]   and making sense of all that,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.720]   or at least routing that information
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.700]   elsewhere in your nervous system to make decision,
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.460]   like if you smell something good to approach it,
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.240]   or if you smell something bad to avoid it.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.220]   The front of the insula is really doing
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.720]   all of that kind of stuff, along with other brain areas.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.820]   The posterior insula, the back of the insula, that is,
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.760]   has a very interesting and distinct set of functions.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.380]   The posterior insula is mainly concerned
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.960]   with what's going on with your somatic experience.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.560]   How do you feel internally and how is the movement
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.960]   that you happen to be doing,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.120]   combining with your internal state to allow you to feel,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.920]   as I like to say, the nervous system
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.120]   mainly batches things into yum,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.040]   like, oh, this is really good for me.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.600]   Yuck, this is really bad for me and I need to stop,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.720]   or meh, this is kind of neutral.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.280]   Okay, so this isn't about food,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.400]   but we could say for most stimuli,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.780]   most senses, whether or not they're senses of things
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.540]   internally or externally,
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.360]   our nervous system is trying to make decisions
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.780]   about what to do with that information.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.340]   And so it mainly batches information into yum,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.060]   I want to keep doing this or approach this thing,
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.480]   or continue down some path of movement or eating
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.560]   or staying in a temperature environment, et cetera,
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.220]   or yuck, I need to get out of here,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.360]   I don't want any more of this,
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.400]   I don't want to keep doing this,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.160]   this is painful or aversive or stressful, and then meh.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.140]   So if it doesn't really matter,
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.740]   I can just kind of stay right here or not.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.420]   Yum, yuck, and meh.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.040]   Well, in your posterior insula,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.960]   you have a very interesting population
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.500]   of very large neurons,
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.000]   these are exceptionally large neurons,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.700]   called van economone neurons.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.140]   These are neurons that are, again,
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.940]   unbeknownst to most neuroscientists
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.380]   and they seem uniquely enriched in humans.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.060]   Chimpanzees have them
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.220]   and some other large animals have them.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.260]   So they're found in whales, chimpanzees, elephants,
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.580]   and in humans.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.660]   But even though we are much smaller than most whales,
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.560]   and even though we are much smaller than most elephants,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.480]   I mean, remember there are baby elephants,
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.060]   as far as I know, they haven't bred up mini elephants yet,
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.100]   they seem to have a teacup version
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.940]   of pretty much every dog breed.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.260]   You can look that up,
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.060]   I certainly have mixed feelings
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.540]   about this notion of trying to downsize everything
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.900]   to the point where you could kind of like
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.360]   the pocket-sized bulldog I think someday will arrive.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.180]   I'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.540]   of different breeds.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.420]   But because there aren't teacup elephants
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.260]   and teacup gorillas and teacup chimpanzees and so forth,
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.100]   most all of those other species are larger than us.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.900]   They have these van economone neurons
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.020]   and we have these van economone neurons,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.420]   but we have in upwards of 80,000 of these things
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.020]   in our posterior insula.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.560]   These other species tend to have
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.200]   somewhere in the range of 1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.760]   Why is that interesting?
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.960]   Well, these van economone neurons
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.900]   have the unique property of integrating
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.780]   our knowledge about our body movements,
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.240]   our sense of pain and discomfort,
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.660]   and can drive motivational processes
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.000]   that allow us to lean into discomfort
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.440]   and indeed to overcome any discomfort
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.080]   if we decide that the discomfort that we are experiencing
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.020]   is good for us or directed toward a specific goal.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.780]   This knowledge turns out to be very important
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.880]   to keep in mind because as we migrate this conversation
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.340]   toward the things that we can do
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.380]   to enhance flexibility in stretching,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.480]   you'll soon learn that there are moments
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.880]   within a stretching protocol where you have the opportunity
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.540]   to either override pain and discomfort,
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.100]   to kind of relax through it or push through it.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.180]   There's a decision fork in the road there,
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.860]   and I'll tell you which fork in the road to take
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.700]   or to say, uh-uh, I'm not going to do that.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.300]   I'm going to allow these natural reflexes of the spindle
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.460]   to kick in and just essentially stop me from stretching
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.620]   if a given limb isn't designed
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.380]   or shouldn't be stretched that far.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.180]   So I'd like you to keep these van economone neurons in mind.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.220]   I should mention they're named van economone
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.340]   because the guy, Constantine van economone,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.460]   that discovered them at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s,
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.060]   decided to name them after himself as many scientists do,
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.820]   or certainly the neurologists and physicians
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.860]   are famous for naming things after themselves.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.740]   These van economone neurons turn out to be very important
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.740]   to keep in mind as we embark on our exploration
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.100]   of what sorts of stretching practices
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.500]   can be best applied to increase flexibility
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.300]   because whether or not you undertake a mild, moderate
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.540]   or intense flexibility training,
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.500]   you will no doubt encounter a scenario at some point
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.100]   where you will have to ask yourself,
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.340]   do I quote unquote relax into this stretch
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.220]   or do I try and push through
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.020]   just a little bit of discomfort?
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.420]   And I'll explain how to gauge that decision
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.900]   in a very specific and ideally safe way.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.740]   And I'll give you some tools
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.060]   that will allow you to make that decision
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.560]   in the way that best preserves the integrity
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.780]   of those neural circuits that I described earlier
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.560]   and can keep you safe.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.760]   These van economone neurons sit in the exact position
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.180]   that one would want to be able to evaluate
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.840]   what's going on in the body,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.360]   in particular, what's going on in terms of limb movements,
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.680]   how that relates to our feelings of discomfort.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.580]   And then there's the other aspect
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.960]   of these van economone neurons,
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.800]   which is that these van economone neurons
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   are connected to a number of different brain areas
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.760]   that can shift our internal state
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.160]   from one of so-called sympathetic activation.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.540]   So this is a pattern of alertness and even stress,
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.040]   sometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.860]   to one of so-called parasympathetic activation
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.800]   to one of relaxation.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.740]   Oftentimes you'll hear that stretching should be done
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.860]   by relaxing into the stretch.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.660]   Well, what does it actually mean to relax into the stretch?
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.960]   Well, these van economone neurons sit at this junction
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.300]   where they're able to evaluate
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.440]   what's going on inside our body
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.000]   and allow us to access neural circuitries
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.920]   by which we can shift our relative level of alertness
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.240]   down a bit or our relative level of stress down a bit
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.520]   and thereby to increase so-called parasympathetic activation
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:04.380]   and to literally override some of those spindle mechanisms,
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.860]   even the GTO mechanisms,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.340]   but especially the spindle mechanisms
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.880]   at the neuromuscular and musculospinal junction.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   And in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.960]   that would otherwise cause us to contract those muscles back.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.340]   The reason that's possible is because your brain
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.000]   has those other kinds of motor neurons,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.720]   the upper motor neurons that can both direct,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.940]   meaning control, and can override lower motor neurons.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.320]   I'll give you a brief example of this
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.000]   that you've already done in your life
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.600]   and that we all have the capacity for.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   What I'm referring to is the monosynaptic stretch reflex.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.200]   This is something that every first year
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.000]   neuroscience graduate student learns,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.040]   which is that if you were to step on a sharp object
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.740]   with a bare foot, you would not need to make the decision
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.080]   to retract your foot.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.960]   You would automatically do that
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.140]   provided you have a healthy nervous system.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.840]   There are mechanisms in place
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.660]   that cause the retraction of that limb
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.560]   by way of ensuring that the proper muscles contract
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.040]   and other muscles do not contract.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.800]   In fact, that they fully relax, okay?
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.360]   So in the case of stepping on a sharp object,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.800]   like a piece of glass or a nail or a tack,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.080]   you would essentially activate the hip flexor
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.500]   to lift up your foot as quickly as possible.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.500]   In doing so, that same neural circuit would activate
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.960]   a contralateral, meaning opposite side of the body circuit
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.120]   to ensure that the leg, the foot,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.160]   that's not stepping on the sharp object
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.760]   would do exactly the opposite and would extend
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.600]   to make sure that you don't fall over.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.520]   All of that happens reflexively.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.240]   It does not require any thought or decision-making.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.580]   In fact, humans without any neocortex,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.560]   literally they're who are decerebrate
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.500]   or an animal that doesn't have, and when I say decerebrate,
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.480]   I mean lack of cerebral cortex,
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.460]   they can perform that because it's all controlled
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.420]   by circuits that are basically below the brain
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.300]   and in the spinal cord.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.780]   There's a little bit of activation of circuits
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.460]   in the kind of deeper parts of the brain,
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.900]   but basically you don't need to think or decide
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.180]   in order to do that.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.940]   However, if your life depended on walking across
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.060]   some sharp objects, let's say,
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.380]   let's make it a little less dramatic
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.220]   so it's not like the "Die Hard" movie or something
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.860]   where he has to run barefoot across the glass,
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.620]   although that's a pretty good example
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.060]   of what I'm describing here,
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.420]   but let's say you had to walk across some very hot stones
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.860]   to get away from something that you wanted to avoid.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.880]   You could override that stretch reflex
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.460]   by way of a decision made with your upper motor neurons,
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.860]   your insula, and your cognition,
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.080]   and almost certainly those van econimo neurons,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.860]   which would be screaming, "Don't do this, don't do this,
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.860]   "don't do this," could shuttle that information
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.460]   to brain areas that would allow you to override the reflex
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.620]   and essentially push through the pain and maybe even,
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.780]   in fact, even, not experience the pain to the same degree
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.440]   or even at all.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.260]   So these van econimo neurons sit at a very important junction
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.280]   within the brain.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.520]   They pay attention to what's going on in your body,
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.580]   pain, pleasure, et cetera,
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.480]   and that includes what's going on with your limbs
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.200]   and your limb range of motion.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.540]   They also are paying attention
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.120]   and can control the amount of activation,
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.580]   kind of alertness or calmness
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.460]   that you are able to create within your body
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.520]   in response to a given sensory experience.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.340]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.460]   they seem to be uniquely enriched in humans.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.880]   They seem to be related to the aspects of our evolution
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.140]   that allow us to make decisions
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.820]   about what to do with our body
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.560]   in ways that other animals just simply can't.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.540]   Before we go any further,
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.420]   I want to give you a practical tool
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.300]   that you can, of course, use,
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.840]   but that will also give you insight and experience
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.380]   into your muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.500]   So what I'd like you to do
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.860]   is if you're in a proper place to do this,
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.260]   you're going to stand with legs straight,
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.740]   meaning knees not bent,
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.860]   and you're going to try and touch your toes,
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.260]   or for some of you, that's going to be very easy
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.100]   and you might even be able to put your hands
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.060]   flat on the floor.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.220]   I don't have that kind of flexibility.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.160]   It's pretty easy for me to touch my toes.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.900]   I don't care if you round your back or not,
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.740]   although ideally I would say don't round your back,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.760]   not because it's bad to do so necessarily,
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.740]   but just to try and keep this the same
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.860]   from trial to trial, as it were.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.980]   So try and get a sense of what your range of motion is
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.580]   in terms of bending over at the waist
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.860]   while maintaining a flat back
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.960]   and trying to touch your toes or even touch the floor.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.700]   Maybe again, you can even go hands flat to the floor,
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.780]   maybe even far out in front of you.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.260]   Okay, now what I'd like you to do is stand back up,
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.780]   and I'd like you to contract your quadriceps
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.260]   as hard as you possibly can for about five to 15 seconds,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.300]   let's say 10 seconds,
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.880]   just to keep things more or less normalized.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.140]   This obviously is not a super controlled experiment.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.540]   So to contract your quadriceps,
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.420]   for those of you that don't know,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.320]   you're going to extend your lower limb out.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.620]   So this would be like kicking,
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.740]   although don't do it too quickly.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.920]   You're going to kick out your foot.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.760]   You should feel your quadriceps contract
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.020]   on the top of your thighs,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.200]   and you're going to try and consciously
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.520]   contract them as hard as you can, okay?
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.940]   Typically, if you want to point your toe
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.380]   back towards your knee or shin,
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.160]   that's also going to help somewhat
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.100]   to contract even harder and harder, okay?
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.880]   So do that for about 10 seconds.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.020]   A lot of you will do this just while standing,
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.620]   contract, contract, contract, okay, then release it.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.140]   And then now go ahead and repeat that stretch
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.460]   where you're trying to touch your toes or touch the floor.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.300]   So this is, again, relying more or less on hamstring
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.820]   flexibility among other things, okay?
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.700]   What most of you will find is that you have
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.060]   an immediate increase in hamstring flexibility
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.300]   or your range of motion has increased.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.560]   If you didn't experience that,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.580]   then I would encourage you to try and contract
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.380]   your quadriceps harder and longer,
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.060]   so maybe 20 or 30 seconds,
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.760]   and then try this so-called experiment again.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.300]   Why would contracting your quadriceps
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.840]   allow your hamstring flexibility to suddenly increase?
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.140]   Well, the way that our muscles are organized
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.860]   is such that we have muscles that are antagonistic
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.980]   to one another.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.640]   So our quadriceps and our hamstrings work
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.680]   in sort of a push-pull fashion, if you will.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.500]   They can antagonize one another.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.160]   So when you move your heel towards your glutes,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.700]   you are using your hamstring.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.540]   The hamstring obviously also does other things
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.860]   related to hip movement.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   And when you lift your knee or when you extend your foot
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.960]   and contract your quadriceps,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.300]   you are essentially relaxing the hamstrings.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.860]   Now, of course, most movements involve
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.740]   both quadricep and hamstring in synchrony,
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.900]   and that synchrony is really an elegant one,
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.060]   but here we're more or less isolating the quadriceps
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.900]   from the hamstrings, at least to the extent
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.120]   that it can leverage these spindle stretch mechanisms.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.500]   So what happens is when you contract your quadriceps hard,
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   you are relaxing or releasing some of the stretch
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.420]   that's occurring in those intrafusal spindle sensory fibers
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.820]   going into your spinal cord.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.660]   And as a consequence, you're able then
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.420]   to stretch your hamstrings further,
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.300]   or we can be more accurate and say that your range of motion
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.980]   about the hamstring and its related joints is greater
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.980]   when you aren't engaging that spindle reflex,
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.580]   which would cause the hamstrings to contract, okay?
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.740]   So if you are somebody who has tight hamstrings,
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.980]   there could be a variety of reasons for that,
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.580]   but part of the reason is likely to be neural,
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.580]   and you can release that neural spindle reflex
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.460]   by contracting the opposite antagonistic muscle,
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.260]   which in this case is the quadriceps.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.660]   The same thing is true and can be leveraged
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.020]   for stretching other muscles.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.780]   So for instance, if you're going to do a tricep stretch,
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.980]   the typical kind of overhead where you grab your elbow
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.620]   and move it toward the midline of your body
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.360]   with the other hand, using your opposite hand,
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.680]   well, you can do that.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.060]   And then I would suggest trying to flex your bicep,
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.700]   contract your bicep, that is, while doing that.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.560]   And for most people, you'll notice a increase
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.140]   in the tricep range of motion or ability
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.800]   to kind of lean into or to relax into
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.780]   or to push that stretch a little bit further.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.900]   Now, for you physios out there,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.000]   and for those of you that have backgrounds in kinesiology,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.160]   I want to acknowledge, of course,
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.720]   there are other mechanisms that are coming into play.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.820]   There are actually neural connections
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.280]   within the joints themselves
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.120]   that are providing proprioceptive feedback,
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   But this is simply to illustrate
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.280]   that part of our range of motion is determined
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.900]   by these spindle mechanisms
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.020]   that I spent some time focusing on earlier.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.800]   And indeed, this approach can be leveraged
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.340]   toward creating increased limb range of motion,
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.960]   not just for the hamstrings, but for your quadriceps.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.620]   So for instance, if you have tight quadriceps,
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.680]   you can do the opposite.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.600]   You can contract your hamstring very intensely
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.040]   for let's say 10 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.560]   So that would take some conscious effort
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.520]   of bringing your heel up towards your glutes.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.540]   You could do that in a way
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.600]   that you're really trying to contract those muscles hard.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.160]   You'd have to use some deliberate hamstring activation there,
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.280]   meaning you have to use those upper motor neurons
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.960]   and the other aspects of your upper brain power, as it were,
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.800]   to try and really contract your hamstrings
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.720]   as intensely as possible.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.480]   Then you would relax that,
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.000]   and then you would do your quadricep stretch again.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.140]   And if you did a pre-hamstring contraction measurement
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.640]   of your quadricep flexibility,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.400]   and then you did a post-hamstring contraction measure
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.880]   of your quadricep flexibility,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   almost certainly you would find
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   that that flexibility had increased.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   Now, of course, the muscle really didn't change much.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.560]   The tendons didn't change much.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.900]   What changed was the patterns of neural activation
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.880]   that were restricting you from, in the first case,
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.760]   stretching your hamstring or having a,
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.120]   to be more accurate, we should say,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   to having a certain range of motion about the hamstring
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.340]   and its related joints.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.780]   And those break mechanisms were removed.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.520]   And of course, then when you contract your hamstring,
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.400]   you're removing some of the neural breaks,
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   the spindle acting as a break
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.200]   and inhibiting that quadricep range of motion.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.980]   Okay, so you can imagine this.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.020]   And in fact, you can apply this
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.760]   for any number of different muscles.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.600]   The larger muscles and the sort of biceps, triceps,
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   and hamstrings, quadriceps are sort of the simplest place
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.340]   to think about this and to apply it.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.980]   But in theory, and indeed in practice,
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.740]   it really works for all the various muscle groups.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.320]   It's just sometimes harder to access
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.160]   these so-called antagonistic muscle groups.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.080]   Now, we should take a moment and just discuss
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.440]   what actually happens as we get more flexible
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.520]   in the short term and long term.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.620]   I just mentioned what happens in the short term.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.920]   Clearly, those don't involve lengthening of the muscles.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.020]   It's not like the muscles slide along the bones
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.160]   or that the tendons really stretch out that much more
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.880]   than they had prior to that kind of exercise.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   But it is the case that if people stretch consistently
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.740]   over a given period of several weeks or more,
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.320]   that there are changes in the muscles.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.600]   This gets a little bit tricky in terms of nomenclature.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.960]   And I just want to highlight that
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.440]   because I think that a number of people
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.160]   get frustrated and confused, in fact,
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.360]   when we talk about muscles getting longer.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.820]   You know, the whole concept of a muscle getting longer
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.760]   isn't really in keeping with reality,
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.220]   but there are elements within the muscles
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.480]   that can change their conformation.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.300]   So to get a little bit detailed here,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.600]   and we won't spend too much time on this,
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.760]   but I just want to acknowledge this
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.720]   for those of you that are interested
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.040]   in neuromuscular physiology
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.960]   and how it relates to flexibility.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.840]   You know, you have your muscle fibers
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.600]   and then you have your so-called myofibrils.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.060]   So you can imagine kind of a single fiber.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.900]   That fiber, of course,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.920]   will get input from those motor neurons.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.360]   And then within those fibers,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.840]   you have what are called sarcomeres.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.320]   And you can kind of think about sarcomeres
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.560]   as little segments, kind of like the segments of bamboo.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.340]   If you ever look at bamboo, it's not just one big stalk.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.520]   It's got those little out pouchings along the way
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   that kind of break up what would be just one big stalk
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   of bamboo into different segments, but they're all connected.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.520]   The sarcomeres are somewhat like that.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.960]   And within the sarcomeres,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.440]   you have a couple of different components.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.800]   One thing is called myosin, which is like a thick layer,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.160]   and then the other is actin.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.920]   And those are interdigitated, as we say.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.380]   They're kind of connected to one another,
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.160]   kind of like if you were to put your fingers together
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.740]   from your two hands,
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.160]   if you were going to put your fingers in between one another,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.040]   that's interdigitate, literally interdigitated in this case.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.980]   So pun intended.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.940]   And the myosin and actin kind of move relative
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.500]   to one another, and they have a lot to do
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.600]   with your ability to contract muscles.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.540]   When we stretch muscles,
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.420]   when we go through a stretching practice,
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.160]   there are a number of things that change, some neural,
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.540]   some related directly to connective tissue,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.680]   but also it appears from really nice work,
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.060]   mainly done from McGill University.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.540]   I'll provide a link to a couple of these studies
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.140]   if you want to dig in there more deeply,
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.840]   that change the conformation, the relative size and spacing
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.660]   of some of these things like sarcomeres
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.380]   and the way that myosin and actin kind of work together.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.360]   But we don't want to think of muscles as lengthening.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:48.460]   We can, however, think about the resting state of a muscle
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.540]   being slightly different or indeed very different
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.800]   than the resting state of a muscle of somebody
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.020]   or of a limb that has not undergone
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.620]   regular flexibility training.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.480]   So that's as much time as I want to spend on that
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.860]   because we could spend an entire hour
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.820]   getting right down into the details.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.500]   But I do want to emphasize, however,
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.860]   that muscles have different parts, they have fibers,
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.520]   they have sarcomeres, they have myosin, they have actin.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.860]   But the idea of making our muscles longer,
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.380]   that reflects a number of processes that occur
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.860]   basically within an existing muscle length.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.720]   The length of our muscle bellies
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.900]   and where our insertions are relative
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.620]   to our connective tissue in our limbs
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.500]   is genetically determined, right?
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.820]   Some people have, for instance,
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.020]   a bicep that goes all the way from the crook of their elbow
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.340]   up to their shoulder, right?
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.180]   And some people can, you know,
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.500]   if they were to put their arm at a 90 degree angle,
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.880]   could put two or three fingers
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.300]   between their bicep and their elbow.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.340]   They have a, we can say, a shorter bicep, relatively shorter.
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.540]   Now, the reason I mention
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.080]   these highly detailed cellular mechanisms
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.300]   is because as we start to embark on different protocols
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.460]   for using stretching to increase flexibility
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.940]   and range of motion,
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.580]   we need to ask ourselves
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.660]   what is preventing our ability to extend range of motion?
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.060]   Is it the spindle, right?
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.880]   Is it because the muscle is stretching too much?
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.460]   Oftentimes it can be because of that
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.540]   and or because of a sense of pain
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:18.820]   or simply a sense that the muscle is not in a position
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.220]   that it's been in before
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.340]   that's unrelated to pain or to spindle activation.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:27.260]   And oftentimes it can be related directly
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.300]   to these changes in the confirmation of myosin and actin
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.080]   and within the context of the sarcomeres.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.820]   Now, of course you can't peer into
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.960]   or sense your individual sarcomeres.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.660]   However, you do have neurons that innervate these areas
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.400]   and that send that sensory information
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.420]   back into the spinal cord
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:45.980]   and up to your brain to interpret.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.220]   So you'll find that as we move along,
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.900]   there are specific adjustments that you can make
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.740]   at both the macro level,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.660]   meaning how much movement to insert into your stretching,
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.300]   right, is it going to be a static or dynamic
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.040]   or even a ballistic stretch?
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.220]   Or for instance, at the micro level
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:08.060]   that even just a slight sub millimeter or millimeter increase
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.700]   in the stretching of a given muscle and related tissues
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.140]   can translate into an increased range of motion performance.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.500]   As a quick but relevant aside,
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.620]   I thought I'd share with you something useful
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:24.240]   that's also grounded in this notion of antagonistic muscles.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.880]   So for those of you that do resistance training,
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.180]   whether or not it's with body weight
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:31.620]   or with physical weights or machines, what have you,
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.940]   you may have found that if you,
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.740]   let's say were to do three sets of a pushing exercise.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.900]   So this could be pushups, this could be bench presses,
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.760]   this could be shoulder presses, something of that sort.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.060]   And then later in the workout, you were to do,
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.080]   let's say machine pull downs or pull ups
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.140]   or chin ups of some sort.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.220]   So a pulling exercise.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.300]   Typically what you would find is if you were to do
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.420]   what's often called straight sets,
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.500]   so you would do three sets of pushups,
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.580]   let's say with two minutes of rest in between,
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.260]   that you might be able to get a certain number of
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.320]   repetitions on the first set.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.800]   Just for sake of example,
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.100]   let's say you can get 10 repetitions on the first set,
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.700]   and then you get eight repetitions on the second set,
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.660]   and then you get six repetitions on the third set
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.460]   with two minutes in between.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.220]   And then you would move on at some point to your
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.620]   pulling exercises.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.900]   And similarly, let's say you were doing chin ups
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.220]   or pull downs, and you would get 10 repetitions,
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.940]   rest two minutes, eight repetitions,
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.780]   rest two minutes and six repetitions.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.060]   Okay, fine.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.700]   Well, typically what people discover is that
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.100]   if they interleave their pushing and pulling exercises,
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.900]   provided they do that for muscles that are antagonistic
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.860]   to one another.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.860]   So in this case, pushing with the chest,
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.780]   shoulders and triceps for the pushing exercises and pulling
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.460]   with the back and biceps,
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.580]   and of course there are other muscles involved as well.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.900]   But because those muscle groups are at least in part
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.780]   antagonistic to one another,
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.480]   what people often find is that if they were to say,
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.700]   do their pushing set, get 10 repetitions,
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.700]   then move to a pulling set after just say 60 seconds
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:09.280]   and perform that pulling set,
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.020]   then go back to the pushing set,
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.140]   then go back to a pulling set, push, pull, push, pull.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.040]   In other words, interleaving their sets,
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.500]   even if they were to maintain the same amount of rest
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.380]   between sets of pushing and sets of pulling,
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:30.120]   what they discover often is that the drop in the number of
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.360]   repetitions that they get is somewhat offset.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.820]   So rather than get 10, eight, six,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.460]   as it were with the straight sets,
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.860]   it will be 10, nine, eight.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.740]   So what this means is not that you're increasing
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.940]   the total rest time to four minutes between sets,
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.800]   because then of course it wouldn't be equivalent,
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.980]   but rather that while maintaining the same amount of rest
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.440]   between sets for this same muscle group,
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.320]   by going from push, pull, push, pull of antagonistic muscles,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.900]   you're able to have improved performance.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.100]   And the reason for that has everything to do
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.060]   with what we were describing before,
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:12.420]   which is that typically if you were to do push, set, rest,
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.960]   push, set, rest, push, set, rest,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.420]   well in between those sets,
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.500]   and in fact actually during those sets of pushing,
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.420]   the pulling muscles that would be involved in the chin ups
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.700]   or pull downs, et cetera, are actually relaxing,
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.940]   or at least are being released of some tension,
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.780]   including the activation of the spindles,
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.180]   among other things.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.200]   So that's a long-winded way of saying
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.280]   that interleaving push and pull of antagonistic sets
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.560]   can leverage some of the same neural circuits
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.720]   that we're talking about leveraging
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.640]   for sake of increasing flexibility.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.140]   Now, I offer this to you as a tool that you can try.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.420]   One of the challenges with using this tool, however,
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.280]   is that you often have to occupy multiple sites
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.140]   within the gym.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.980]   If you're doing this at home and you have your own gym,
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.940]   that's one thing.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.820]   If you're doing this in a gym
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.600]   where you have multiple pieces of equipment,
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.900]   well, then you become that person
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.360]   who has essentially taken over some small corner
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.340]   or multiple corners or machines within the gym.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.080]   And oftentimes you'll find that you'll walk back
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.460]   to a machine or you'll walk back
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.540]   to a given resistance exercise
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.960]   and someone has now taken it over
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.180]   and the whole thing could be thrown off.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.580]   So it takes a little bit of orchestrating
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.240]   in order to do properly.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.380]   But in general, what people find is that this can allow you
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.700]   to enhance performance overall of these individual movements
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.920]   again, while maintaining the same amount of rest.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.940]   And even if you choose not to do this,
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.900]   I encourage you to pay attention to this as a concept
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.280]   because again, it's leveraging this idea
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.300]   of antagonistic muscles, flexors and extensors,
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.620]   antagonistic neural relationships
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.640]   between the spinal cord mechanisms
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.840]   that control one set of muscles
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.120]   and activating those muscles,
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.960]   allowing the opposite antagonistic muscle to relax
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.580]   and therefore to perform better on its next set.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.120]   So now I'd like to shift to the question
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.840]   of what types of stretching can and should we do
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.340]   to increase limb range of motion?
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.100]   If our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.380]   'cause I realized that most people don't have
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.900]   endless amounts of time to dedicate
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.180]   to a stretching practice.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.900]   And even for those of us that do,
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.040]   I'm sure that you want to get the most outcome
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.700]   for a given effort.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.580]   And what are the modes of stretching
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.300]   that are going to allow us to increase our flexibility
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.100]   and limb range of motion most safely?
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.060]   Now, there are a number of different types of stretching
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.000]   or methods of stretching.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.960]   Broadly defined, we can describe these as dynamic,
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.640]   ballistic, static, and what's called PNF stretching.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.100]   PNF stands for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation,
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.460]   and it involves and leverages many of the mechanisms
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.080]   that I described to you earlier.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.100]   The first two that I mentioned,
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.700]   dynamic and ballistic stretching,
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.820]   both involve some degree of momentum
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.700]   and can be distinguished from static and PNF type stretching.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.020]   Now, to distinguish dynamic stretching
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.720]   from ballistic stretching,
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.420]   like to focus on this element of momentum.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:11.340]   Both involve moving a limb through a given range of motion.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.680]   In dynamic stretching, however,
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.400]   it tends to be more controlled, less use of momentum,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.960]   especially towards the end range of motion.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.080]   Whereas in ballistic stretching,
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.540]   there tends to be a bit more swinging of the limb
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.260]   or use of momentum.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.980]   So I invite you to visualize what dynamic and ballistic
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.560]   stretching might look like in your mind.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.860]   You can even try it if it's safe for you to try it.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.780]   Now, you could imagine, you're swinging your arm up overhead
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.300]   as much as possible and bringing it down.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.500]   I'm doing this because I'm seated
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.440]   as kind of ridiculous movement to do well seated
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.840]   or perhaps at all.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.200]   But for instance, you can see dynamic
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.880]   and ballistic stretching anytime someone, for instance,
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.820]   is holding onto something with one arm
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.640]   or maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.680]   So essentially getting movement about the hip joint.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.640]   And you'll notice that some people raise it up
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.240]   and pause it and bring it down.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.800]   That's one form of dynamic stretching.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.160]   Whereas others will swing it up
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.280]   and sort of let it carry itself a bit further
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.980]   due to the momentum at the top of the movement
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.360]   and then just let it drop back down
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.940]   or maybe even control the descent.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.640]   There is an enormous range of parameter space here
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.600]   or variables that one could imagine.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.120]   And there's just simply no way
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.300]   that we could subdivide all those.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.440]   But again, dynamic and ballistic stretching
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.640]   both involve movement.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.240]   So we have to generate some force
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.460]   in order to create that movement.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.000]   Ballistic stretching involving a bit more momentum
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.440]   or sometimes a lot more momentum,
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.040]   especially at the end range of motion.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.120]   Now, both of those are highly distinct
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.380]   from static stretching,
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.200]   which involves holding the end range of motion.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.000]   So minimizing the amount of momentum that's used.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.840]   So to stay with a simple example
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   that we are all now familiar with
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.360]   from our earlier discussion,
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.400]   slowly bending over at the waist
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.420]   and trying to touch your toes
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.320]   or putting your hands to the floor
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.800]   and then holding that end position
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.260]   before coming up in a slow and controlled way
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:09.400]   such that you reduce the amount of momentum to near zero
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.240]   would be one example of static stretching.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.560]   Static stretching can be further subdivided
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.880]   into active or passive, right?
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.340]   There are different names for these kinds of approaches.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.000]   You can hear about the Anderson approach
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.020]   or the Jonda approach.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.040]   You can look these sorts of things up online.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.100]   And again, people tend to name things after themselves.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.760]   So some of these are proprietary
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.060]   related to specific programs.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.380]   I'm not focusing on those.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.620]   Others come to be named after the physiologists
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:38.140]   or the practitioners that initially popularized them.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.520]   As is always the case,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.060]   there's always a naming and renaming
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.520]   and claiming of territory with these things.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.360]   For the time being,
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.780]   I'd like to just emphasize that static stretching
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.440]   can be both active
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.760]   where there's a dedicated effort
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.840]   on the part of the stretcher, you,
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:58.040]   to put force behind the hold
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.360]   to kind of extend
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.960]   or literally to extend the range of motion.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.760]   And then there's also passive static stretching
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.820]   in which it's more of a relaxation
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.920]   into a further range of motion.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.380]   And that can be a subtle distinction.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.400]   And there are other ways
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.700]   in which we can further distinguish
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.900]   active and passive static stretching.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.660]   But nonetheless, static stretching involves
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.380]   both those types of elements, active and passive,
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.220]   but is really about eliminating momentum.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.480]   And then there's the PNF,
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.660]   the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.760]   And proprioception has several different meanings
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.400]   in the context of neuroscience and physiology.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.800]   To just keep it really simple for today,
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:40.120]   proprioception involves both a knowledge and understanding
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.740]   of where our limbs are in space
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.460]   and relative to our body,
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.880]   typically relative to the midline.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.020]   So the brain is often trying to figure out
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.720]   where are our limbs relative to our midline
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.480]   down the center of our body.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.880]   And we know where our limbs are
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.100]   based on so-called proprioceptive feedback.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.800]   So that's feedback that comes from sensory neurons, right?
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.500]   Now you know what sensory neurons
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.260]   that are essentially monitoring or responding to events
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:11.280]   within the joints, the connective tissue and the muscles.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.920]   And within the deep components of the muscles,
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.960]   like the spindle reflex and within the tendons,
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.060]   like the GTO, the Golgi tendon organ.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:25.060]   So PNF type stretching leverages these sorts of mechanisms,
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:29.940]   these neural circuits by way of, for instance,
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.100]   you would lie on your back.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.300]   And if your goal is to increase your hamstring flexibility
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.580]   and the flexibility and range of motion
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.160]   of other related muscle systems,
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.300]   you might put a strap around your ankle
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:46.260]   and pull that muscle, or I should say, excuse me,
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.460]   that limb towards you.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.280]   You're not going to pull the muscle towards you.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.380]   You're going to pull that limb, your ankle towards you
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.620]   to try and get it sort of back over your head
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.500]   and then progressively relaxing into that,
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.420]   or maybe even putting some additional force
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.820]   to push the end range of motion and then relaxing it.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:04.760]   And then actually trying to stretch that same limb
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.520]   or increase the limb range of motion without the strap.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.500]   Sometimes these are assisted by other people.
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.700]   So people will even use loads.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.780]   Sometimes they'll even use machines.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.660]   There are a number of different apparati
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.900]   that have been designed for this.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.780]   Sometimes it'll involve a training partner.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:25.160]   There's a huge range of PNF protocols.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.900]   And those protocols can be done both by oneself
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.860]   with or without straps, with machines,
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.460]   with actual weights or with training partners.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.900]   If you're interested in the variation of exercises
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.960]   to say target your hamstrings versus your quadriceps
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.600]   versus your shoulders versus your chest muscles, et cetera,
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.680]   your neck muscles, and so on.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.640]   There is an enormous range of information
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.580]   on dynamic ballistic static and PNF stretches
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.600]   for all the various muscle groups.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.300]   And I should say there are some excellent books
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.140]   on those topics.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.800]   There are also some excellent videos on YouTube
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.860]   and elsewhere.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.300]   Nowadays, it's pretty easy to find exercises
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.820]   that allow you to target specific muscle groups,
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.300]   again, I encourage you to be safe in how you approach this.
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.820]   And I would encourage you also to pay attention
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.520]   to the information that soon follows
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.940]   as to what sorts of protocols one would use
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.780]   to apply those exercises.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.940]   But the number of exercises and the availability
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:23.220]   of those exercises for targeting different muscle groups
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.320]   with these four different kinds of stretching
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.860]   is both immense and fortunately, thankfully,
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.780]   immediately accessible to all of us often at zero cost.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.520]   So specific exercises to target specific muscle groups aside,
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.860]   we've now established that there are four major categories
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.840]   of stretching, or at least those are the four major
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.660]   categories I'm defining today.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:47.940]   And we can further divide those categories
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.060]   into which are the ones that are going to be most effective
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.740]   for increasing range of motion in the longterm,
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.180]   not just in one individual session.
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.380]   And there've been a number of studies exploring this.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:02.000]   I can list out at least four and we'll put those four
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.300]   as a kind of a cluster under one heading
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.280]   in the show note captions that arrive
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.140]   at essentially the same answer,
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.820]   which is that for increasing limb range of motion,
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.600]   it does appear that static type, including PNF,
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.000]   but static type stretching is going to be more effective
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.880]   than dynamic and ballistic stretching.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.660]   So at least to my mind, this is good news.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.820]   Why is it good news to me?
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.680]   Well, while dynamic and ballistic stretching
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.400]   can be immensely useful for improving performance
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.820]   of specific movements, in particular in the context
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.420]   of particular sports like tennis or in sprinting,
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.000]   or frankly, for any sport, they do carry with them
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.440]   a certain amount of risk because of the use of momentum.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.580]   So you don't need to be highly trained
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.660]   in order to perform them.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.300]   In fact, there is a place and we will describe
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.900]   when one would want to apply dynamic or ballistic stretching.
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.800]   I'll just give away for now.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.620]   I think that most physios out there,
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.020]   and certainly the ones that I spoke to Dr. Andy Galpin,
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.380]   Dr. Kelly Starrett, and a few others point to the fact
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:16.380]   that doing some safe dynamic and ballistic stretching
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.880]   prior to say a resistance training session,
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.300]   or maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.500]   can be useful, both in terms of range of motion effects
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.540]   and in terms of neural activation effects.
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.880]   I don't want to use the words warm up
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.800]   because warming up is typically associated
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.980]   with increasing core body temperature as it should be,
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.460]   but for engaging the neural circuits
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.180]   and becoming familiarized with the neural circuits
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.120]   that you're about to use in other movements,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.480]   while also increasing the range of motion
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.840]   of the joints involved in those movements
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.420]   so that you can perform them more safely
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.760]   and more confidently.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.540]   So I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat,
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.860]   I'm certainly not saying that dynamic
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.480]   and ballistic stretching are not useful.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.060]   They absolutely are.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.540]   But in terms of increasing limb range of motion
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.140]   in the long-term of truly becoming more flexible
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.380]   as opposed to transiently more flexible,
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.660]   static stretching, which includes PNF,
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.780]   appears to be the best route to go.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.420]   So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:21.800]   for a given muscle group, or perhaps for all muscle groups,
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.600]   although you can imagine that'd be pretty tough.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.260]   I mean, you're not going to spend time,
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.320]   I could imagine working on your tongue muscle control
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.980]   or neck muscle control and every muscle control,
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.100]   but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness,
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.700]   in air quotes, and increase limb range of motion
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.500]   for certain muscle groups.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.720]   And it appears that the best way to do that
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.420]   is going to be static stretching of some kind,
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.560]   which raises the question of how often
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.760]   to do that static stretching
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.040]   and how long to hold those static stretches.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.840]   And we can also ask the question,
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.620]   we should ask the question,
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.580]   where to hold those static stretches?
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.740]   Is it always a good idea to hold those static stretches
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:04.140]   at the end or the point of maximal range of motion?
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.560]   We're going to address that now.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.660]   There's some terrific science around this.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.940]   A slightly older study, but nonetheless a powerful one
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.760]   because it provided a foundation
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.060]   for a lot of subsequent work,
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.960]   which basically served to just confirm
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.340]   the answer they got here,
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.540]   is a study from Bandy et al, and the title of this study
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.460]   is "The Effect of Time and Frequency of Static Stretching
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.740]   on the Flexibility of the Hamstring Muscles."
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.000]   It's a study involving 93 subjects.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.820]   So 61 men, 32 women, ranging in age from 21 to 39 years,
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.220]   so a pretty broad demographic,
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.640]   who had limited hamstring muscle flexibility,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.660]   here I'm paraphrasing,
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.140]   and randomly assigned to one of five groups.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.520]   So the four stretching groups stretched five days per week
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.360]   for six weeks.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.500]   The fifth group, which served as a control, did not stretch.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.460]   The results clearly show that, quote,
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.740]   "The change in flexibility appeared to be dependent
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.700]   on the duration and frequency of stretching."
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.540]   This is great.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:02.620]   This tells us that stretching for a given amount of time
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.700]   scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.820]   that one will see.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.500]   There were many interesting findings within this study,
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.060]   but the one that I'd like to highlight most is, quote,
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.780]   "The results of this study suggest
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.720]   that a 30-second duration is an effective amount of time
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.560]   to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.320]   in order to increase range of motion.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.460]   No increase in flexibility occurred
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.300]   when the duration of stretching was increased
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.240]   from 30 seconds to 60 seconds,
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.560]   or when the frequency of stretching was increased
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.060]   from one to three times per day."
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.280]   Okay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.480]   What this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us,
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.100]   and we will get into those subsequent studies,
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.340]   is that ideally one would do static stretches
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.740]   that are held for 30 seconds,
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.400]   perhaps more in certain instances,
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.180]   and I'll explain when that can be useful,
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:59.420]   but here, holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.580]   did not turn out to be additionally useful.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.860]   So if you're going to stretch your quadricep, for instance,
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.540]   and you're going to hold that stretch in static fashion,
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.860]   remember, not using momentum,
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.580]   and you can use the mental tricks
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.840]   of either trying to push through the pain,
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.000]   which I don't recommend necessarily.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.560]   I think that makes us prone to injury,
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.200]   or to relax into the stretch,
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.480]   but nonetheless, providing some force,
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.600]   typically with a hand in order to pull your ankle back
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.860]   if you're doing a quadricep stretch.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.760]   Some people might do this on the edge of a sofa.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.600]   Remember, there are a lot of different exercises
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.260]   and ways to do this that you can explore elsewhere.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.720]   Well, holding that static stretch for 30 seconds
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.800]   appears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.060]   in limb range of motion over time.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:44.960]   Again, these are protocols
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.360]   that were used repeatedly over time,
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.640]   and we'll talk about how often to repeat them
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.260]   in order to get maximum effect.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.920]   But 30 second holds for static stretches
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.820]   is the number that I think we want to focus on,
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.940]   and that most of us are going to want to utilize.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:00.860]   So now let's explore how many sets of static stretching
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.380]   one ought to do in order to get
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.140]   a maximum range of motion improvement
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.740]   while not placing us into a system
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.260]   that's going to create injury,
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.860]   nor a situation where we have to be
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.700]   constantly stretching throughout the day,
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.120]   because again, most of us don't have time to do that.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.500]   This issue of sets is an important one.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   In the context of cardiovascular exercise,
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.460]   we've talked about the data that support the fact
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.700]   that doing at least 150,
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.300]   and ideally as much as 200 minutes per week
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.340]   of zone two cardiovascular exercise
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.120]   is very useful for cardiovascular health
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.860]   and for other aspects of health.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:36.960]   And of course, there are other aspects
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.900]   of cardiovascular exercise that could be layered
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.680]   onto and into that that can be useful,
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.340]   like 90 second maximal sprints, et cetera,
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.220]   discussed this a lot in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.180]   and on our episode about endurance.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.860]   And we also talked about sets in the context
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.800]   of strength and hypertrophy building,
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.380]   building muscle size and or strength
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.300]   in the episode about that,
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.140]   and in particular in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:03.000]   And there, we could also arrive at some specific parameters,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.700]   and it's going to vary, of course, between individuals,
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.100]   depending on how hard you train,
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.740]   whether or not you take sets to failure,
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.580]   your repetition range, et cetera.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.980]   But in the context of strength and hypertrophy building,
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:16.740]   we arrived at approximately six,
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.860]   maybe as many as 10 sets per week per muscle group.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.620]   Some of that work is done as direct work
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.820]   to a given muscle group.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.300]   Some of that work is indirect.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   So doing a certain pulling exercise, of course,
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.960]   will target the latissimus dorsi muscles,
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.980]   but also the biceps.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.940]   So that doesn't necessarily mean you have to do 10 sets
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.460]   for the biceps and for the lats.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.340]   Sometimes you're getting some indirect work, et cetera.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.300]   All of that was delineated in the episode
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.740]   with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.300]   And we arrived at those numbers of sets
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.320]   according to the same criteria that we will apply here.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.120]   What is the minimum number of sets both to maintain
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:56.620]   and to improve a given mode of performance?
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.340]   Strength and hypertrophy or cardiovascular health.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.300]   Again, to either maintain or improve.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.340]   And we can do the same thing for improving
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.220]   or maintaining range of motion.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.740]   Because as I mentioned earlier,
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.300]   the data points to the fact that if we don't do
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.740]   some dedicated work to improve range of motion over time,
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.240]   we will lose our flexibility and limb range of motion
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.640]   over time, just by virtue of the fact
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.700]   that we're not doing anything to offset that.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:25.620]   So whether or not you want to maintain, reestablish,
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:29.060]   or gain limb range of motion,
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.940]   static stretching of holds of 30 seconds appear to be best.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.860]   Now the question is, how long should you do that?
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:37.700]   And how many sets should you do that?
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.180]   And how many times a week should you do that?
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.300]   And to answer those questions,
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.740]   I'm going to turn to what I think
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.420]   is a really spectacular review.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.100]   This was a review that was published in the year 2018.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.300]   So it's fairly recent.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.880]   First author, Thomas, Edwin Thomas, last author, Palma.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.060]   We will put a link to this in the show note caption.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.920]   The title of the paper is the relation
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.800]   between stretching typology and stretching duration,
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.340]   the effects on range of motion.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.060]   It's a very straightforward title.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:07.340]   This is a review article that explored
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.920]   a number of different studies.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.060]   Had criteria for whether or not those studies
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:15.480]   could be evaluated in the context of the questions here.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.600]   Had some quality standards and some other standards
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.440]   that they applied.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.400]   And basically winnowed down a large collection of studies
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   to a remaining 23 articles that were able
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.360]   to be considered, quote, eligible and included
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.880]   in the quantitative synthesis done here.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.960]   So key points from that quantification
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.080]   and synthesis done in this paper.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.120]   First of all, and I quote, all stretching typologies
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.200]   showed range of motion improvements over a long-term period.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.920]   However, the static protocols showed significant gains
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.560]   with a P value less than 0.05,
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.200]   which means a probability that cannot be explained
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.480]   by chance alone when compared to ballistic or PNF protocols.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.680]   So again, what we're hearing is that static stretching
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.040]   is the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.620]   Although here they make the additional point
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:07.700]   that static stretching might even be superior,
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:12.700]   not just to ballistic stretching, but also to PNF protocols.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.000]   Because before, as you may recall,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.940]   there was a distinction between ballistic and dynamic
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.300]   and static and PNF.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.240]   And so here it appears again that static stretching
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   is sort of rising to the top of the list
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.040]   as the optimal approach relative
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.700]   to all other stretching approaches,
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.880]   at least in the context of increasing limb range of motion.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.760]   The authors go on to say time spent stretching per week
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.700]   seems fundamental to elicit range of movement improvements
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.800]   when stretches are applied for at least
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.680]   or more than five minutes per week.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.860]   Okay, this is critical.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.900]   This is not five minutes per stretch.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.080]   Remember, 30 seconds per static stretch,
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.440]   but at least five minutes per week.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.660]   Whereas the time spent stretching within a single session
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.440]   does not seem to have a significant effects
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.600]   for range of motion gains.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.940]   If this is getting confusing,
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.980]   I'll make sure that you soon understand
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.100]   exactly what we can export from these conclusions.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.700]   The data indicate that performing stretching
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.720]   at least five days a week,
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.620]   now some of you may already be groaning,
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.740]   for at least five minutes per week.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.100]   Okay, so five days per week, that's a lot,
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.160]   but at least five minutes per week,
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.020]   five minutes per week is not that much,
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.360]   using static stretching may be beneficial
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.240]   to promote range of motion improvements.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.000]   Okay, I've read this study in detail now.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.300]   They highlight again, the reduction in flexibility
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.820]   that occurs from 20 to 49 years of age and so on,
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.080]   how acute bouts of short-term stretching
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.380]   up to three weeks can improve stretch tolerance.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.980]   I think that's a key point that in the short term,
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.360]   the first three weeks of embarking
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.980]   on a stretching and flexibility program,
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.180]   much of the improvements
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.100]   come from the short-term neural improvements
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.080]   that we talked about before
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.940]   of inhibiting the spindle reflex and so on,
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.540]   and also a stretch tolerance,
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.060]   a comfort with doing the movements
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.660]   and maybe even a comfort in overriding
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.740]   some of the pain mechanisms.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.140]   I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a bit
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.700]   and the particular utility of yoga,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.820]   something that I don't often practice,
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.340]   but that after reading this article
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.700]   that I'll mention in a little bit,
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.420]   I'm considering perhaps taking up
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.260]   some form of yoga protocol.
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:18.380]   Now, I've already highlighted
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.660]   some of the key takeaways from the study,
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.100]   namely that we need to get at least five minutes per week
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.680]   of static stretching per muscle group.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.940]   And based on the previous paper that we talked about,
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:33.540]   we need to divide that five minutes
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.580]   into sets of 30 seconds each.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.660]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.060]   it doesn't seem to be the case
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.100]   that you can do all of that in one day, unfortunately.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.340]   It does seem important that the frequency
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.060]   of stretching practice distributed
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.080]   throughout the week is important.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.140]   So let's talk protocols.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.240]   We are now talking about doing static stretching,
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.000]   so holding, so limiting momentum,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.460]   and holding a stretch for 30 seconds per set.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.980]   We're talking about trying to achieve
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.980]   five minutes per week of those static holds,
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.020]   but that we can't do it all in one session
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.120]   because the frequency of sessions
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.000]   distributed throughout the week correlates
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.360]   with the improvements in limb range of motion.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.640]   So what this means is that we should probably be doing
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.620]   anywhere from two to four sets
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.640]   of 30-second static hold stretches,
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.620]   five days per week, or some variant thereof.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.540]   And I do say some variant thereof,
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.860]   because it turns out that even though
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.140]   there was that earlier study that we talked about,
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.940]   that holding a stretch for more than 30 seconds,
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.540]   in that case, 60 seconds,
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.360]   didn't turn out to be additionally beneficial.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.020]   It appears that if you do hold those stretches
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.040]   for 60 seconds per static stretching set, for instance,
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.420]   you can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.900]   So in order to make this as clear as possible,
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.300]   'cause I do realize there are a lot of parameters,
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.500]   and you might be asking,
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.660]   why didn't you just make me a list
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.020]   of the exact things I should do?
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.120]   Well, it doesn't work that way,
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.100]   because once you understand the mechanisms
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.400]   and once you understand your particular goals,
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.660]   this information is designed for you to be able
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.340]   to construct a stretching program
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.580]   that is tailored to your specific goals.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.940]   If I just gave you the stretching program that I'm doing,
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.500]   or I should say that I'm soon to be doing,
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.780]   'cause I'm soon to be doing one
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.540]   based on the research for this particular episode,
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.460]   well, that wouldn't be beneficial for you.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.340]   Because for instance, if you have very flexible hamstrings,
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.300]   but not very flexible quadriceps,
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.920]   or you are somebody who is engaged in sport
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.900]   or not engaged in sport,
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.920]   what you need to do is going to vary somewhat.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.340]   So what would effective stretching protocol look like?
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.580]   We're all trying to improve limb range of motion
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:45.900]   for different limbs and different muscle groups,
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.160]   but just by way of example,
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.400]   and that's because the one we've been using,
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.540]   let's talk about hamstrings for the time being.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.240]   This could of course be applied to other muscle groups.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.040]   Let's say you want to improve hamstring flexibility
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.000]   and limb range of motion about and around the hamstring
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.400]   and involving the hamstring.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.720]   You would want to do three sets
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.020]   of static stretching for the hamstring.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.880]   Again, easy to find such exercises on the internet.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:18.180]   You would do that by holding the stretch for 30 seconds,
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.480]   resting some period of time and doing it again,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.100]   holding for 30 seconds, resting some period of time,
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.260]   and then holding it for 30 seconds.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.700]   That would be one training session for the hamstrings.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.780]   I have to imagine that you'd probably want to stretch
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.520]   other muscle groups as well in that same session.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.940]   Although at least as far as I could tell,
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.940]   there were no data pointing to the fact
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.860]   that you couldn't do your hamstring stretching
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.700]   one part of the day
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.980]   and your quadriceps stretching another part of the day,
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.180]   but presumably you're going to want to combine
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.900]   your flexibility training into one single session.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:52.900]   So three sets of 30 seconds each, you get 90 seconds,
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.940]   and you would do that ideally five times a week
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.700]   or maybe even more because it does seem like frequency
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.980]   distributed throughout the week is an important parameter.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.440]   Now, one thing that we have not highlighted
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.180]   or at least described is how long to rest
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.140]   between stretching sets.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.300]   And despite my efforts,
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.540]   I could not find research back information
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.740]   that pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.140]   for every 30 seconds stretching
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:23.480]   or 60 seconds rest for every 30 seconds stretching
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.780]   was ideal.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.980]   I think it's reasonable to assume that
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.700]   doubling the amount of time for the interleaving rest
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.700]   would be appropriate or at least doable.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.940]   If anyone out there has knowledge about rest
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:39.420]   between stretching sets and has some physiology
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.700]   or some biology or some experiential information
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.980]   as to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:50.220]   to rest in between static stretch sets ought to be used,
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.380]   please put it in the comments on YouTube.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.460]   That'd be a terrific way for us to get that information.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.220]   I'd love to do any follow-up to links that you provide
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.620]   and so on.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:02.060]   But now we're starting to build into a protocol
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.900]   that is backed by the scientific data.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.940]   Three sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.380]   or maybe even six times per week.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:14.740]   One thing that did show up in my exploration
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.260]   of the peer-reviewed research
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.360]   is this notion of warming up for all this.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.720]   We haven't talked about that yet.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.120]   In general, to avoid injury,
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.420]   it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.100]   before doing these kinds of stretches,
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.420]   even these static stretches,
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.860]   which we can sort of ease into
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:33.820]   and don't involve ballistic movement by definition.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:38.020]   And the basic takeaway that I was able to find was
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:41.220]   that if we are already warm from running
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:44.440]   or from weight training or from some other activity,
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.140]   that doing the static stretching practice
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.300]   at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.860]   or other physical session
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.560]   would allow us to go immediately into the stretching session
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.820]   because we're already warm, so to speak.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.540]   Otherwise, raising one's core body temperature by a bit
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:04.620]   by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:08.420]   of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements,
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:11.100]   provided you can do those without getting injured.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.680]   Seems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.520]   We should be warm or warm up to stretch,
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.220]   although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.860]   And then just by way of logic,
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.640]   doing the static stretching after resistance training
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.300]   or cardiovascular training seems to be most beneficial.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.860]   In fact, and unfortunately,
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.420]   we don't have time to go into this in too much detail today,
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:34.220]   I was able to find a number of papers that make the argument
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:38.060]   that static stretching prior to cardiovascular training
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.800]   and maybe even prior to resistance training
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.580]   can limit our performance
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.060]   in running and resistance training.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.260]   I realize that's a controversial area.
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:51.300]   You have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.780]   You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance.
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.100]   And those that say, no,
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.200]   it's a matter of how exactly you perform
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.300]   that static stretching and which muscle groups
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.340]   and how you're doing this and how much time in between
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.700]   static stretching and performance.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.660]   But to leave all that aside,
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:09.540]   doing static stretching after some other form of exercise,
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.820]   and if not after some form of exercise,
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.500]   after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature,
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   definitely seems like the right way to go.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.680]   Now for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well,
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.140]   doing something five days a week
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.180]   seems like a big commitment,
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.980]   even if that commitment is one to only do three sets
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.820]   of 30 second static stretches.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.300]   I say this because you've got the warmup.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.460]   I generally like to bring a kind of a focus
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.060]   and dedication to a practice.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.100]   And of course, because when doing these kinds of protocols,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.940]   it's likely that you're not just stretching your hamstrings.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.660]   So it's not just 90 seconds of work
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.540]   with a minute of rest in between,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.440]   but very likely that we're also doing quadriceps stretching
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.220]   and also doing stretching for the shoulders
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.300]   and stretching for the back and the neck and so on.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:54.940]   And so that entire session is going to take some time.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.460]   And five days a week is a pretty serious commitment for most,
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.200]   especially for those of us that don't exercise
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.620]   or do athletics for a living, which I don't.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.340]   So there is some evidence from the literature
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.020]   that one can get away with,
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.660]   or I don't even know that we should think about it
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.500]   as getting away with,
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.100]   but that one can do longer hold static stretches
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.260]   of up to say 60 seconds,
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.920]   but do fewer total sessions per week.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.220]   So rather than three 30 second static holds,
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.480]   doing three 60 second static holds
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.100]   and doing those every other day.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.540]   And there really hasn't been
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.100]   a systematic exploration of this.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:36.180]   The article that I was referring to just a few moments ago,
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:40.700]   this analysis of the 23 articles
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.100]   was combined into this enormous set of tables
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.300]   and some really quite nice graphs
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.740]   that you're welcome to look at
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.060]   since we're going to provide a link to the study.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:52.060]   There are a couple of key takeaways that I want to mention
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.720]   that are separate from this issue of
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.940]   how long to stretch and how often.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:59.600]   First of all, they describe in their discussion
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.300]   that there were improvements in range of motion
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.920]   independent of whether or not people did
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.920]   static stretching, active stretching,
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.920]   passive stretching, ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.600]   So all of those forms of stretching
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.480]   will improve limb range of motion.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.140]   This is essential to point out,
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.280]   and I want to emphasize this.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.820]   Static stretching, however,
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:25.920]   gave the greatest degree of gains in limb range of motion.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.760]   And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase,
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.200]   but some of the other increases they observed
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.140]   were also quite substantial.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.640]   So ballistic stretching can also provide
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.480]   some pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.240]   However, they tended to be in the range of,
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.920]   here they point out 11.65% increase,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.360]   or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.260]   So it appears that the greatest improvements
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.160]   in limb range of motion for your time spent and effort spent
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.560]   is going to be this minimum of five minutes per week
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.100]   to elicit a significant response,
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.640]   with five days being the minimum
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.220]   weekly recommended frequency
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:07.420]   to achieve significant range of motion improvements.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.320]   I confess this was pretty surprising to me
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.960]   when I compare flexibility training to, say,
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.360]   resistance training for strength and hypertrophy.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   I've had the experience,
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.080]   and I know that other people have had the experience,
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.700]   and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree that,
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.060]   provided one trains hard enough and appropriately,
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.680]   that you don't need to train resistance training
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.740]   five days a week in order to get significant improvements
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.840]   in strength and hypertrophy.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.180]   Some people might need to,
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.080]   but you can get a lot of positive results
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.160]   in those variables with less frequent training,
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.600]   certainly with three or four days a week of training.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.260]   And for cardiovascular training,
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.200]   I'm not aware of anyone having tested
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.380]   whether or not one very long run each week
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.240]   can actually increase cardiovascular fitness
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.260]   and you're not doing anything else,
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.940]   although I have to imagine you'd probably see
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:58.020]   some improvement compared to not doing anything.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:01.620]   But most people are doing repeated training sessions
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.100]   of cardiovascular strength training.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.860]   Not a lot of people are doing five days a week
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.500]   of strength training, at least that I'm aware of.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.140]   Some people are, but most people I think are not.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.400]   And some people are doing five or more days a week
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.400]   of cardiovascular training.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.640]   I'm guessing that most people are not doing
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   five days a week of dedicated static stretch
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.740]   range of motion directed training.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.220]   But it does appear that that frequency about the week,
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.440]   getting those repeated sessions,
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.780]   even if they are short for an individual muscle group,
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.020]   turns out to be important.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.460]   And so that points to the, perhaps the reason
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:40.480]   why so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.560]   But it also reminds me that all of the studies
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.620]   that were described, at least in this review,
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.700]   and some of the other ones that were not,
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.120]   really show impressive changes in limb range of motion.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.140]   I mean, 20 plus percent, or even 15% with PNF.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.040]   I mean, these are big changes that are going to benefit us.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.460]   They're going to offset the age-related losses
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.280]   in flexibility for sure,
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.540]   if one is dedicated about these practices.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.260]   And in many cases,
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.460]   they're going to increase limb range of motion
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.260]   in ways that are going to allow us better performance
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:15.140]   in certain physical endeavors, certainly better balance.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.300]   Or we haven't really talked about balance and stability,
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.180]   but range of motion can impair balance and stability
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.720]   in some extreme circumstances.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.760]   But by and large, limb range of motion,
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.420]   lack of tightness, improved posture,
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:29.260]   improved physical performance, excuse me,
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.380]   and things of that sort is something
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.940]   that I think we can all benefit from
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.600]   and that are key features of longevity.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.620]   We don't often think of them
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.980]   because we so prioritize cardiovascular health
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.920]   and the relationship between the heart and brain health
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.820]   and resistance training and musculoskeletal hypertrophy
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.120]   or strength, et cetera.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.420]   But as I delved into this literature,
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:52.140]   it really highlighted for me the extent to which
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:54.780]   having really good limb range of motion,
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.880]   at least maintaining limb range of motion
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.980]   as we age from year to year,
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:01.380]   and maybe even improving limb range of motion
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:04.700]   can be immensely beneficial for reducing pain,
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.140]   for again, improving posture,
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.360]   improving our ability to perform, to walk, et cetera.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.400]   And indeed there's a whole literature
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.640]   that relates our limb range of motion
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.380]   to things like pain management
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.140]   of things related to headache and so on and so forth.
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.760]   So limb range of motion is not just about
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.980]   becoming a contortionist
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.300]   or being able to complete the yoga class.
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.320]   It really is about maintaining the integrity
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.980]   and the health of the neuromuscular system,
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.340]   the connective tissue,
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.840]   and the neuromuscular connective network,
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.300]   because those are indeed working
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.140]   as an ecosystem and a network.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:40.020]   I'd like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:40.860]   for a moment.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:44.820]   Again, this is a vast landscape with many parameters
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:45.780]   and different practitioners,
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:50.780]   a lot of competing opinions out there to put it lightly.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:54.340]   Nonetheless, I do want to emphasize
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:57.480]   that the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.540]   and GTO mechanisms that we talked about earlier.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:02.420]   But I realized that in describing
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.920]   the quadricep contraction hamstring stretch,
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.720]   little mini experiment that hopefully you did,
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.220]   that I didn't really highlight the role of the GTOs,
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:13.220]   the Golgi tendon organs that much.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:16.220]   And I just would like to just briefly do that for a moment.
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.300]   The GTOs have multiple functions.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.060]   In fact, I think even though GTOs
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.740]   are in every medical textbook, every physiology textbook,
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.640]   every first year neuroscientist learns about them
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.420]   when learning about the neuromuscular junctions
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.160]   and the mechanisms of interoception, et cetera,
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.660]   they are likely to have other functions as well.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.200]   And one of the reasons why PNF stretching does work,
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.260]   whether or not you're doing that by using a strap
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.980]   to pull back a limb
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.420]   or whether or not you're actively contracting
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.620]   your quadriceps to then release
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.420]   and emphasize stretch range of motion
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.140]   for your hamstrings and related muscle groups
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:58.020]   is that activation of those GTOs,
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.500]   meaning putting loads and tension into that system,
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.780]   can inhibit the spindles
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:07.980]   in the opposite antagonistic muscle groups.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:11.280]   And so one of the reasons why flexing,
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.460]   or I should say contracting your quadriceps
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.720]   really intensely for some period of time
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.940]   allows your hamstrings to subsequently experience
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.600]   greater range of motion.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.980]   And again, it's not just the hamstrings,
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.760]   but the related connective tissue
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.140]   and neural circuits, et cetera,
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:32.060]   is because yes, it's quote unquote relaxing
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.240]   the hamstrings and the spindle,
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.920]   but there's also a direct relationship
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.060]   between activation of the GTOs in the quadricep
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:45.740]   and release of the spindles
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.380]   in the hamstring and related muscles.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.900]   This has a name, it's called autogenic inhibition.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:53.700]   It's a fancy name for contraction of one muscle group,
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.280]   providing a relaxation of the other muscle group
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.260]   that's antagonistic to it.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.900]   And it relates back to this idea
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.620]   of interleaving sets in the gym.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.020]   So if you think back to that example,
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:08.280]   now it should make sense as to why, for instance,
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.760]   if you do, let's say a set of bench presses
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.060]   or shoulder presses,
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.460]   and let's say you get 10 repetitions
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.020]   and you fail on the 11th,
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.300]   that muscle is very, very fatigued.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.220]   If you were to rest some period of time
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.980]   and then go back and do another set,
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:26.100]   well, during the rest, that muscle group has been relaxing.
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.940]   It's obviously not contracting the same way it was
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.820]   during the resistance set.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:32.540]   But by going and doing a pulling exercise
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.500]   that involves the antagonistic muscle group,
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.320]   so strongly contracting the back muscles through a pull,
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.620]   like a pull down or a chin up or a row type exercise,
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:45.980]   you're activating or near activating the GTO system
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.220]   in those pulling muscles
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.940]   in a way that provides autogenic inhibition
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:52.760]   for the pushing muscles.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.480]   Now, again, the physios out there
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.100]   are probably either screaming or banging their heads
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.940]   against whatever sound system
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.660]   this happens to be arriving through to them saying, wait,
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.800]   but in many cases, the GTOs aren't activated enough
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.580]   to provide that autogenic inhibition.
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:11.660]   That's true, but even the sub-threshold activation
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.480]   of those intraspinal circuits,
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.700]   so the place where the GTO circuit
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.500]   and the spindle circuit interact,
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.860]   can provide an additional replenishment
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.900]   of say the pushing muscles
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:24.700]   while you're activating those pulling muscles.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.660]   And this is at least one, not the only,
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.040]   but at least one mechanisms
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.940]   by which interleaving push and pull, push and pull
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:33.060]   for both strength and hypertrophy training,
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:37.540]   but also for range of motion stretching type training
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:40.620]   can allow you to achieve better results
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.280]   in a shorter period of time.
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.940]   And I raise this because I want to keep in mind
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.220]   the efficiency of any training program.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.980]   We just a moment ago established that doing, for example,
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.280]   three sets of 30 second static holds
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.780]   can be very useful for the hamstrings with,
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.980]   let's just say for sake of simplicity and practicality,
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.620]   a minute's rest in between.
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.500]   But during that minute's rest,
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:06.340]   you can stretch the opposite antagonistic muscle group,
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:08.340]   such as the quadriceps.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.740]   Or if you want to use PNF training,
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.780]   you could do loading of the quadriceps in between.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:15.020]   So there are a number of different ways
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:19.100]   in which you can start to interleave static stretching
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.840]   with PNF stretching.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:24.500]   You can start to interleave even PNF type protocols
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.520]   with resistance training,
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.760]   although that gets a bit more complicated.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.220]   You can really start to construct
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.800]   and build protocols that are ideal for you.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.840]   What we will do is for an upcoming neural network newsletter.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.160]   So for those of you that aren't familiar,
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.180]   the Huberman Lab podcast
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.920]   has a so-called neural network newsletter.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.160]   These are monthly newsletters
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.400]   where we put distilled points from the podcast
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.860]   and oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.380]   You can access it by giving us your email.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.900]   We don't share your email with anybody.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:53.060]   If you want to see examples of these,
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.560]   you can go to HubermanLab.com
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.260]   and go to the menu and see newsletter.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.360]   You don't have to sign up for anything
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.500]   to see examples of what these are like.
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.880]   I'll provide a couple of different protocols,
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.620]   one that is pure static stretching,
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.800]   one that involves PNF type stretching,
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   and I'll also put down a protocol
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.980]   that involves the antagonistic interleaved muscle training
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:15.180]   of the sort that I've been describing
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.900]   a few times throughout this episode.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.900]   And then you can try and apply those either separately
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.660]   or maybe combine them in some way
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.220]   that's useful for your goals.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.740]   There are a couple of key elements
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:27.580]   that are essential for building a safe and effective
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:30.600]   range of motion increasing program
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.240]   that arrived to us both through the peer reviewed research
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.980]   and admittedly from people that have been involved
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:38.500]   in teaching and training range of motion
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.340]   for a very long period of time.
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:41.580]   Some of you may be familiar
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.200]   with the so-called Anderson method.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.160]   It's been around for a long time.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.700]   I actually have never met Anderson.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.020]   I don't, I should know this.
[01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.280]   I don't even know if he's still alive.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.480]   I hope he's still alive.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.060]   But in any event, there are a lot of different features
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:55.160]   to the Anderson and other protocols.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.720]   But one of the aspects of the Anderson protocol
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.300]   that I think is highly relevant,
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:01.500]   in fact, I know is relevant to the peer reviewed research
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.580]   that we're going to talk about in a few moments
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:06.820]   is this notion of pushing through pain
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:10.740]   and how active or how passive to be about static stretching.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:12.780]   Now this is somewhat subjective, right?
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.700]   If you think about getting into a stretch,
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.540]   again, we'll just use the hamstrings for example.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.480]   So you're either reaching for your toes while seated
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.820]   or maybe you're using a strap
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:27.100]   and you're raising your foot overhead while lying down,
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.220]   or maybe you're doing a toe touch type exercise.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:34.020]   How far should you reach?
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.220]   Where is the end range of motion?
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:37.060]   Should you bounce?
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:37.880]   Should you not bounce?
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:38.720]   We're going to talk a little bit more
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.020]   about that in a moment.
[01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.660]   But Anderson has an interesting idea and principle
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.980]   which is thread through a lot of his teachings
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.860]   that I think are very much in keeping with the study
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.660]   that I'm about to describe next,
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:53.160]   where he emphasizes to yes,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.520]   to stretch to the end of the range of motion,
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:59.340]   but not to focus so much on where that range of motion
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:01.320]   happens to be that day.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.800]   So for instance, not thinking,
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.880]   oh, I can always touch my toes, for instance,
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.240]   and therefore that's the starting place
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.820]   for my flexibility training today,
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:15.120]   but rather to take the entirety of your system
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.060]   into account each day and understand that,
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.780]   okay, provided you're warmed up appropriately,
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.420]   that you're now going to stretch your hamstrings,
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:24.500]   for instance, and you're going to reach down for your toes,
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.580]   but that your range of motion might be adjusted that day
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.660]   by way of tension and stress,
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:31.900]   or by way of ambient temperature in the room.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.660]   And to basically define the end range of motion
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.780]   as the place where you can feel the stretch
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.380]   in the relevant muscle groups.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:43.140]   I think this is important because unlike resistance training
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.780]   or cardiovascular training,
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.400]   where we can measure distance traveled over time
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.860]   in the case of cardiovascular training,
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.620]   or how much weight is on the bar
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.860]   and count repetitions, et cetera,
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.840]   with range of motion training,
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.980]   of course, range of motion is the feature
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.200]   that we're interested in,
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:02.220]   but there is likely to be a lot of variation from day to day
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.500]   based on a number of different internal and external factors.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.820]   And so the Anderson method is really about
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:10.500]   getting into static and other forms of stretching.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.880]   I think today we've mainly been focusing on static stretching
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.300]   and holding the end range of motion,
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.140]   but really paying attention to the feel of the stretch
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.460]   and the muscles involved.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.520]   And there are parallels in resistance
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.820]   in cardiovascular training too, I realize, right?
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:26.220]   In the case of trying to build hypertrophy,
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:29.160]   or I should say improve hypertrophy muscle size,
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.180]   oftentimes the best advice that one can give
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.940]   is to don't try to lift weights,
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.400]   but rather to challenge muscles.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.240]   Now, of course, you need to provide adequate loads
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.760]   in order to get hypertrophy,
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.400]   but when you're training purely for strength,
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.480]   it's about moving weights.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.160]   When you're training purely for hypertrophy
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.260]   or mainly for hypertrophy,
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.260]   it's really about challenging muscles
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.500]   using weights or other forms of resistance.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:54.040]   And similarly, and in keeping with this Anderson method,
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.260]   when trying to build limb range of motion,
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.740]   doing static stretching at a place where it's difficult,
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:03.780]   but that you can experience the stretch of the muscle
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.700]   cognitively, consciously,
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.800]   being able to focus on the muscles and their stretch
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.640]   is at least as useful as is evaluating
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.660]   the current range of motion you're able to achieve.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.500]   So what does this mean?
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.400]   This means feel the muscles as you stretch them,
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.720]   don't just go through the motions.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.340]   And this means don't get so attached
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.680]   to being able to always achieve, for instance,
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.880]   a stretch of a given distance within a given session.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.240]   You might actually find that by just finding the place
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.100]   where you can't get much further
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.240]   and holding the static stretch there,
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.680]   that on the second and third set
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.820]   that you happen to be doing that day,
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:40.100]   that your range of motion will be increased considerably.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:42.580]   Maybe not, but very likely, yes, you will.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:46.180]   And of course, evaluating range of motion over time
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:48.460]   is the key parameter because that's the goal
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:49.640]   of all this type of work.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.900]   Now, along these lines,
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.220]   there is this variable that we've mentioned a few times
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.340]   of passive versus active stretching.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:00.340]   And there's this even more nebulous variable,
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:02.120]   this even more kind of subjective thing
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.500]   of how much effort to put into it.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.620]   Should you push into the stretch?
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:09.500]   Do you even want to bounce a tiny bit?
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:12.600]   Would you want to reach into that end point
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.960]   and try and extend it within a given set and session?
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.520]   And for that reason, I was excited to find this paper
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.820]   entitled "A Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.900]   on Lower Limb Range of Motion Measurements
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.900]   in Recreational Dancers."
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.640]   It happens to be done in recreational dancers.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.680]   It's a six-week intervention program
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.640]   that compared low-intensity stretching,
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.900]   which they call micro-stretching.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:35.940]   They used a capital M.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.940]   So I don't know if that means that it's proprietary,
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:41.640]   although I didn't see evidence of a conflict of interest,
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.420]   but they call it micro-stretching.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:46.460]   But to be very clear,
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.740]   micro-stretching in the case of this manuscript
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.820]   is low-intensity stretching.
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:52.940]   And they compared that with moderate-intensity
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.900]   static stretching on an active and passive ranges of motion.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.900]   Okay, so there are a lot of different variables are here,
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.420]   but I'll just highlight a few of the things
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.120]   that are really most relevant to us.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.060]   And I'll give you the takeaway at the outset
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.500]   and then return to it at the end
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.420]   so that if I lose any of your attention
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:10.380]   in the next couple of minutes,
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:14.100]   at least you have that key takeaway.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:15.580]   Basically, what they found was that
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.020]   a six-week training program
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.780]   using very low-intensity stretching
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:22.900]   had a greater positive effect on lower limb range of motion
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.040]   than did moderate-intensity static stretching.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.440]   I find that incredibly interesting.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.800]   So very low intensity,
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.060]   and we'll define what that means in a moment.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:33.560]   Here, I'm quoting them.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.700]   "The most interesting aspect of the study was
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.760]   the greater increase in active range of motion
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.360]   compared to passive range of motion
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.720]   by the micro-stretching group."
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.640]   So this relates to what we were just talking about
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.780]   a few moments ago as it relates to the Anderson method,
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.960]   which is that very low-intensity stretching,
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:53.680]   meaning effort that feels not painful,
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.860]   and in fact, might even feel easy
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.440]   or at least not straining
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.700]   to exceed a given range of motion,
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.920]   turns out to not just be as effective,
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.640]   but more effective than moderate-intensity stretching.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.080]   So what is low-intensity static stretching?
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.640]   Well, they define this as the stretches were completed
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:17.320]   at an intensity of 30 to 40%,
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.840]   where 100% equals the point of pain, right?
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.440]   So 30 to 40% in these individuals,
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.640]   and again, I'm paraphrasing,
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.600]   induced a relaxed state within the individual
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.680]   and the specific muscle,
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.680]   and here they were holding these static stretches,
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.340]   I should mention, for one minute, not 30 seconds.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:37.520]   Now, the control group was doing
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.560]   the exact same overall protocol,
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:44.300]   so daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises,
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:47.120]   holding each set for 60 seconds,
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.320]   but we're using an intensity of stretch of 80%,
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.840]   where, again, 100 represents the point of pain
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.240]   or the point where the person would want to stop stretching.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.900]   I find these data incredibly interesting
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.480]   for I think what ought to be obvious reasons.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:05.360]   If you're going to embark on a flexibility
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.760]   and stretching training program,
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.880]   you don't need to push to the point of pain.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.580]   In fact, it seems that even just approaching
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:15.080]   the point of pain is going to be less effective
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.080]   than operating at this 30 to 40% of intensity
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.960]   prior to reaching that pain threshold,
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.600]   the pain threshold being 100%.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.080]   Now, of course, this is pretty subjective,
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.920]   but I think all of us should be able to register
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.560]   within ourselves as to whether a given range of motion
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.960]   or extending a given range of motion
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.720]   brings us to that threshold of pain or near pain.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.680]   And according to this study, at least,
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.600]   operating or performing stretching
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.720]   at an intensity that's quite low, that's very relaxing,
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.920]   turns out to be more beneficial
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:51.440]   in increasing range of motion than is doing exercises
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:54.360]   aimed at increasing range of motion at a higher intensity.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.760]   Okay, so lower intensity stretching,
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:59.340]   I should say lower intensity static stretching
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:02.360]   appears to be the most beneficial way to approach stretching.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.600]   And I think that's a relief probably to many of us
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.720]   because it also suggests that the injury risk
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.760]   is going to be lower than if one were pushing
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.960]   into the pain zone, so to speak.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.160]   The authors offer a number of different explanations
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.900]   as to why this microstretching approach
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.120]   might be more effective.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.440]   Here, I'm paraphrasing from their discussion
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.760]   where they mentioned that it could be hypothesized
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.640]   that they had improved reciprocal inhibition
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.840]   within the hamstring muscle group.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.960]   So this gets right back to the sorts of neural mechanisms
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.900]   that we talked about before,
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.760]   that somehow by doing this low intensity stretching,
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.720]   that they were able to access some of those spindle
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:41.000]   and GTO type mechanisms that we were referring to earlier
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.600]   and the inhibition of hamstring and quadricep stretches.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.120]   They also offer a number of different ideas
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.640]   about how this could shift the activation
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.840]   of the so-called sympathetic,
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.520]   remember the kind of stress division of our nervous system,
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.620]   and to reduce that relative to activation
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.940]   of the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.640]   I confess they have a couple of arguments
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.300]   around sympathetic, parasympathetic
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:06.900]   that are somewhat convoluted.
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:10.900]   I will just, in fairness to the neuroscience
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.260]   on those systems, I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.980]   on their arguments about sympathetic and parasympathetic.
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:20.320]   To my mind, they didn't really hold much water,
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.340]   but here I'm not trying to be disparaging
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:24.960]   of the overall work, which I think is really quite sound,
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:28.480]   which is that low intensity so-called microstretching
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.360]   is going to be the most effective way
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.200]   to increase limb range of movement over time.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.240]   I want to just briefly return to this idea
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.880]   of whether or not to do ballistic or static stretching
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.920]   before some sort of skill training or weight training
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.720]   or any kind of sport
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.300]   or even cardiovascular exercise like running.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.240]   Again, the data are really split out there.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.920]   There are even folks who suggest
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.460]   that doing any kind of stretching prior to running
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.240]   is going to lower running efficiency.
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.120]   It's going to require essentially more work
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.180]   and more oxygen uptake at a given speed
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.180]   for a variety of reasons.
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:04.660]   And runners and that community argue about this endlessly.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.760]   There are papers in both sides in both directions.
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.040]   I'm sure I'll hear about some of this in the comments.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.580]   I'm not really going to take a stance on this
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:14.560]   as a consequence because the data are all over the place.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.900]   However, I think there's a general logic
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.960]   that we can apply in here.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.400]   I'm borrowing from some conversations
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.200]   and some information put out there by Dr. Andy Galpin,
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.940]   who I think is, of course, both an expert
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:26.780]   and thinks about these things
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:30.500]   in a really sound and flexible way, no pun intended.
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:34.920]   There are instances, for example,
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.700]   where an individual might want to do some static stretching
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.520]   to increase limb range of motion
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.140]   prior to doing weight training,
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:44.660]   even if it's going to inhibit that person's ability
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.300]   to lift as much weight.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:47.340]   Why would you want to do that?
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:50.160]   Well, for instance, if somebody has a tightness
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.140]   or a limitation in their neuromuscular connective tissue
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:56.600]   system someplace in their body and system
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:00.000]   that prevents them from using proper form
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.720]   that they can overcome by doing some static stretching,
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.600]   well, that would be a great idea, as Dr. Galpin points out.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.480]   Or for instance, if proper stability within the movement
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.540]   requires increasing limb range of motion in some way,
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.720]   well, then compromising the use of greater loads
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.000]   could be greatly offset by doing some static stretching
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.840]   to improve, say, hamstring flexibility
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.560]   or another muscle group flexibility.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:28.320]   So we can't always think about just what's going to allow us
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.960]   or inhibit us from using the maximum amount of weight
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.680]   or from running as far as we want to run
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.240]   as fast as we want to run.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:36.880]   There are instances where people are trying
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.920]   to overcome injuries, where they're trying to come back
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:42.840]   from a reparative surgery or something of that sort,
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.040]   coming back from a layoff,
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:47.560]   where some additional static stretching prior
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.920]   to cardiovascular weight training or skill training
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.640]   or sport of some kind is going to be useful
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.600]   because it's going to put us in a position
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.180]   of greater safety and confidence and performance overall,
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.680]   even if it's adjusting down our speed
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.880]   or the total amount of loads that we use.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.240]   So it's you that needs to consider whether or not,
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.420]   for you and within a given training session,
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.160]   you want to do static training,
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.000]   I should say static stretching range of motion training,
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.560]   prior to or after that training session.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.400]   And similarly, there are a lot of data points
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.120]   in the fact that doing some dynamic
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:27.400]   or even ballistic stretching prior to skill training
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.960]   or cardiovascular weight training can be beneficial
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.360]   in part to warm up the relevant neural circuits,
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.000]   joints and connective tissue and muscles,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.760]   and as well to perhaps improve range of motion
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.120]   or ability to perform those movements more accurately
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.160]   with more stability and therefore with more confidence.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.560]   And while Dr. Andy Galpin would never name
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:50.720]   any protocol after himself, he's far too humble to do that.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.780]   I've named a couple of protocols after him,
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:55.640]   particularly the Galpin equation for hydration,
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.000]   because he was willing to stick his neck out there
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.280]   and put down some specific numbers that people could follow
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.900]   in order to ensure proper hydration during training.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.320]   You can look up the Galpin equation elsewhere,
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.680]   you can just Google it or look elsewhere, you'll find it.
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:15.280]   And Dr. Galpin has also been very thoughtful and generous,
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:19.000]   and I think very accurate in offering a kind of a general
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.880]   organizational logic for how to think about the goals
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.420]   of a particular training session and thereby to decide
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:28.680]   whether or not you're going to do ballistic
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.040]   or static stretching and so on and so forth.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.720]   So we can refer to this general approach
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.480]   as Galpinian, Galpinian, is that right?
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:41.560]   Galpinian logic, Galpinian logic.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.220]   Thus far, we've been talking about stretching
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:46.500]   for sake of increasing limb flexibility and range of motion,
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:49.520]   but there are other reasons perhaps
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.120]   to embark on a stretching protocol
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.760]   that include both our ability to relax
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.120]   and access deep relaxation quickly,
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:01.660]   as well as even to reduce inflammation
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:04.600]   and perhaps even combat certain forms of cancer.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.380]   And if that sounds really far-fetched,
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:09.380]   I want to emphasize that the study I'm about to share
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.400]   with you in a moment was actually carried out
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:14.660]   by one of the directors of a division
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.400]   of the National Institutes of Health.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.100]   And this was the work of Helene Langevin,
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:24.440]   who's a medical doctor, has done really important work
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:29.980]   on the mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:31.260]   and has approached all that
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:34.220]   from a very mechanistic viewpoint, right?
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:36.420]   So not looking just at the effects of acupuncture,
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:39.400]   but really trying to understand what sorts of cytokines,
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.000]   inflammatory molecules and pathways are activated,
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000]   what sorts of neural mechanisms get engaged
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.300]   by things like acupuncture that impinges
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:52.160]   on the fascial tissues and so forth.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.320]   And Dr. Langevin is currently a director
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.160]   of the National Institutes of Complementary Health
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:00.680]   and Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.680]   So this is a major division supported by tax dollars
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.160]   that support systematic mechanistic exploration
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.400]   of things like respiration, meditation, yoga, acupuncture.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.260]   So this is serious science applied to protocols
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.080]   and approaches that have been used for some period of time,
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.740]   but really aimed at trying to understand
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:21.660]   what would the best protocols be to evolve new protocols.
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:25.280]   So there's a really interesting study done in animal models,
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.480]   but I think it's a powerful enough result
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.620]   that I think we all should pay attention to it.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:31.040]   The title of this paper, and again,
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.720]   the last author is Dr. Langevin herself,
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.320]   is stretching reduces tumor growth in a mouse
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.600]   breast cancer model.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.580]   And yes, you can get mice to stretch.
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:44.040]   It turns out that if you gently lift up mice by their tail
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.020]   and they'll hold onto their cage,
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:47.400]   there's a way in which you can mechanically stretch them
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.860]   in a way that doesn't harm them.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:51.240]   First, I should mention that Dr. Langevin and others
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.080]   have shown that just a brief whole body stretch
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:58.100]   of that sort induces an increase in activation
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:01.900]   of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.420]   Again, not arm limb arm, but the aspect
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:08.140]   of the autonomic nervous system that creates a whole body,
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:11.840]   whole nervous system shift toward more relaxation.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.140]   So yes, indeed, stretching induces relaxation
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:19.380]   at a systemic level, not just at a local level.
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:21.100]   And I think that's important.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.640]   Probably not surprising to those of you
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.260]   that use stretching regularly,
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.340]   but yes, it does indeed relax us.
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:29.580]   Yes, you can do this in mice and see that in mice as well.
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.940]   Here's what they did for this current study,
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:35.660]   or I should say this was a study published in 2018
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:37.020]   in Scientific Reports.
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:40.780]   They write, "Recent studies have shown
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:42.500]   "that gentle daily stretching for 10 minutes
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.600]   "can reduce local connective tissue inflammation
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.440]   "and fibrosis."
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.700]   Now that's local tissue inflammation and fibrosis
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:53.760]   as well we now know as systemic inflammation
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.780]   and can induce relaxation systemically.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.840]   In this case, they focused on mice, not humans.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.640]   And mice were randomized to a stretch
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:05.220]   versus no stretch condition and were treated
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.420]   for 10 minutes once a day for four weeks.
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:11.700]   So it's 10 minutes of this passive whole body stretching
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:14.680]   a day for four weeks.
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:17.120]   What's remarkable, I mean, just I have to say
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.440]   is just striking is that tumor volume in these mice,
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.100]   they were able to induce tumors in these mice
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.100]   and the tumor volume at the end point
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:27.460]   was 52% smaller in the stretch group.
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.280]   Compared to the no stretch group.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.560]   This is a highly significant effect.
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:34.940]   And they point out in the absence of any other treatment.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:37.700]   And they explored whether or not cytotoxic immune responses
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:40.500]   were activated and a number of other features.
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:41.740]   They weren't able to get too deeply
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:43.900]   into the underlying mechanisms,
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:45.540]   but this is pretty remarkable.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:47.980]   Even three weeks into this stretching protocol,
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.800]   this daily stretching protocol for these mice,
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:51.020]   tumor volume was reduced.
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:54.040]   I mean, by, you know, it's almost halved.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:55.620]   This is pretty incredible.
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.620]   So they have these measures of tumor volume
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:01.340]   and the only difference in the way these animals
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:04.580]   were treated and handled was the introduction
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.220]   of this daily stretch.
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:09.700]   I find this result to be of course limited
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.140]   and to the extent that it's done in an animal model,
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:14.100]   not in humans, we have to point that out.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.200]   But as they point out in their discussion,
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.300]   our results demonstrate a 52% reduction
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:20.380]   in mammary tumor growth over one month
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.560]   in mice undergoing stretching for 10 minutes a day
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.660]   without any other form of therapy.
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:26.980]   Do they think that stretching itself
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.500]   is changing the tumor size?
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.340]   No.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:31.820]   In fact, they raised the possibility that stretching
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:33.700]   because of its impact on the fascia
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.380]   might even create micro environments
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.720]   that are more permissive for tumor growth
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.820]   in certain instances.
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:41.260]   So they're careful to emphasize
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.880]   what I also believe to be the case,
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.020]   which is that it's unlikely that the stretching itself
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.560]   was directly acting to reduce tumor size,
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.320]   but rather that there's this possible link
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.580]   between inflammation and immune exhaustion mechanisms
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.020]   that if you can periodically relax a nervous system,
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:59.260]   here through stretching,
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:02.300]   that it can affect certain pathways
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.400]   related to the immune system
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.540]   that would allow the immune system to combat tumor growth
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:07.800]   to a significant degree.
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:10.060]   So again, even though this is a study in mice,
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.860]   it argues that relaxation induced by stretching
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:15.540]   can have a powerful influence on mammary tumor growth.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:20.540]   Again, a huge effect carried out by one of the premier labs
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:23.980]   and individuals who do this sort of work
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:25.060]   and think about this sort of thing.
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:26.040]   And of course, I want to point out,
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.120]   it wasn't just Dr. Langevin that did this study.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.640]   There are a number of co-authors on the study.
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.140]   We'll provide a link to the co-authors.
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:34.300]   Excuse me, we will provide a link to the study
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:37.100]   so that you can peruse it in more detail if you like.
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:40.460]   Now, as a related and somewhat final point,
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.500]   I'd like to return to this idea and this place,
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.480]   this real estate within our brain
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.140]   that we call the insular cortex, the insula.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:50.560]   As you recall, way back at the beginning
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.500]   of this episode, we were talking about
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:54.700]   the von Economo neurons, that Constantine von Economo,
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:58.100]   the Austrian scientist discovered.
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:01.260]   And the fact that we are able to make
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:05.540]   and perform interpretations of our internal landscape pain,
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:07.980]   our dedication to a practice.
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.840]   For instance, whether or not we are in pain
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:14.100]   because it's a practice that we are doing intentionally
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.520]   and want to improve ourselves,
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.380]   or whether or not it's pain that's arriving
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:20.880]   through some externally imposed demands or situations.
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.400]   Well, the insula is handling all that.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.120]   And fortunately, there's a wonderful paper
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:28.840]   that was published, it was a few years ago now
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.380]   in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which is a fine journal.
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:34.740]   This is the year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:37.360]   Increased Pain Tolerance in Yoga Practitioners.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.200]   I'll tell you why I like this study.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.120]   I'm personally not a practitioner of yoga.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.940]   I've taken a few yoga classes over the years.
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:44.880]   I've done some of the hot yoga classes.
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:49.440]   Those rooms can get really, really warm, I confess.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.840]   And I've done the kind of standard yoga every now and again.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.180]   It's not something that I've kept up regularly.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:53:00.180]   This study explored the effects on brain structure volume
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:03.680]   in yoga practitioners.
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.680]   And for those of you out there that are aficionados in yoga,
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.400]   they pulled subjects from having backgrounds in the,
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.720]   here I'm probably going to mispronounce
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.440]   these different things and forgive me,
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:17.020]   the vinyasa yogas, the ashtanga yogas,
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.300]   younger yogas, the sunanda yogas.
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:21.580]   Okay, so some people were new to these practices.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:24.060]   Some were experienced.
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:26.240]   The important takeaways were that
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.160]   they took these yoga practitioners
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.260]   and they didn't explore their brain structure
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.560]   in the context of yoga itself.
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.440]   They looked at things like pain tolerance.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.460]   So they used thermal stimulation.
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:37.940]   Basically, they put people into conditions
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:40.360]   where they gave them very hot or very cold stimuli
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.120]   and compared those yoga practitioners
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.940]   of varying levels of yoga experience
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:47.240]   to those that had no experience with yoga,
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.400]   so-called controls.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.080]   And they found some really interesting things.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.760]   I got a lot of data on this paper,
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.760]   but here's something I'd like to highlight.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:59.220]   The pain tolerance of yoga practitioners
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:04.220]   was double or more to that of non-yoga practitioners,
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.580]   even for those that weren't doing
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.240]   the so-called hot yoga, right?
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:10.560]   They also found that pain tolerance was significantly greater
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:13.280]   both for heat pain and for cold pain.
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.800]   They also found significant increases in insular,
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:21.880]   again, the insula, this brain region, gray matter volume.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:23.400]   Typically, when we talk about gray matter,
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.360]   we're talking about the so-called cell bodies,
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:29.920]   the location in neurons where the genome is housed
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:33.080]   and where all the housekeeping stuff is there.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.000]   And then white matter volume tends to be the axons,
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.440]   the wires, because they're in sheaths
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.200]   with this stuff that appears white in MRIs
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:42.000]   and indeed is white under the microscope
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:42.840]   and indeed is white.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.700]   It's actually lipid, which is myelin.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:48.260]   So increased gray matter volume of the insula
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:51.700]   is a significant finding because what it suggests
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.560]   is that people that are doing yoga
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.480]   have an increased volume of these areas of the brain.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:59.080]   They're associated with interoceptive awareness
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.080]   and for being able to make judgments about pain
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.920]   and why one is experiencing pain,
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.260]   not just to lean away from pain,
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:08.660]   but to utilize or leverage or even overcome pain.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:12.940]   So there are many studies of yoga and meditation out there,
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:15.940]   few that have as much mechanistic detail as this one.
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:18.380]   And in fact, there's a beautiful figure,
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:19.860]   figure three in this paper,
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:21.700]   that shows that the gray matter volume
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:24.460]   of this particular brain region scales
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:28.300]   in an almost linear way with the duration of yoga practice
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.980]   that somebody has been taking on in years.
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:32.320]   So people that had, they had a few subjects
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:35.340]   that have up to 15 or 16 years of yoga practice
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:39.260]   had much larger left insular gray matter volume,
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:42.660]   bigger brain areas associated with these abilities.
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.180]   And I find this interesting
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.860]   because there are a lot of activities out there
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:50.540]   that don't create these kinds of changes in brain volume,
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.060]   especially within the insula.
[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:54.380]   So it appears that it's not just the performance
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:57.000]   of the yogic movements, but the overcoming
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.860]   or the kind of pushing into the end ranges of motion
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:03.460]   and to push through discomfort to some extent.
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.700]   Of course, we want people doing that in a healthy safe way,
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.660]   but that's allows yoga practitioners
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:13.180]   to build up the structure and function of these brain areas
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.340]   that allow them to cope with pain better
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:17.980]   than other individuals and to cope with other kinds
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:21.260]   of interoceptive challenges, if you will,
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:24.620]   not just pain, but cold, not just pain,
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:27.220]   but discomfort of being in a particular position
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:28.060]   to do that.
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:30.260]   And again, we wouldn't want people placing themselves
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:33.900]   into a compromised position literally that would harm them,
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.540]   especially given that earlier we heard that microstretching
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:39.820]   of the kind of non-painful sort, low intensity sort
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:41.220]   is actually going to be more effective
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:42.960]   for increasing end range of motion.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:45.020]   But this study really emphasizes the extent
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:49.960]   to which practitioners of yoga don't just learn movements,
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:52.980]   they learn how to control their nervous system in ways
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:56.960]   that really reshapes their relationship to pain,
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.900]   to flexibility, and to the kinds of things
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:03.180]   that the neuromuscular system was designed to do.
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:06.820]   And as a final point, there's a beautiful graph
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.000]   in this paper, beautiful, I think,
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.060]   because it explores some of the more subjective dimensions
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:15.980]   of yoga and insular function, which is a,
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:18.560]   here I'll read it out in the nerdy form,
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.940]   and then I'll explain what it means.
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:22.340]   This is a frequency histogram of categories
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:25.700]   of mental strategies used by yogis versus controls
[01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:27.740]   during the cold pain tolerance task.
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:32.740]   What they're describing here and showing is quantitatively
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:36.220]   how people are conceptualizing cold pain
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:37.860]   in order to get through it.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:39.500]   And the different categories are,
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.640]   for instance, distraction, right?
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.140]   Some people just choose to distract themselves
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.300]   from pain or to attempt to.
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:46.900]   Other people will try to ignore it.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:50.940]   It's a lot like distraction, but nonetheless,
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.100]   to engage in a negative emotion,
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.680]   sort of like, I'm going to dig,
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.600]   I'm going to be in resistance to this.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:00.740]   Control subjects tended to use those approaches,
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:04.520]   whereas practitioners of yoga tended to use other sorts
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:07.540]   of subjective approaches, like positive imagery,
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:10.560]   to some extent, the ability to relax
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:15.280]   despite the extreme cold, the ability to quote unquote,
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:17.380]   accept, like this is just happening
[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:18.800]   despite the extreme cold,
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:21.240]   to observe, to third person themselves.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:24.940]   And the greatest effect of course was to breathe,
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.120]   to focus on their respiration
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.380]   as a way to deal with this challenge, this cold challenge.
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:34.260]   Now, all of that is our subjective data,
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:38.440]   but I want to remind you that the practitioners of yoga
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:41.320]   are not just using entirely different mental strategies,
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:44.960]   but they are far more effective at dealing with pain.
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:48.480]   Their pain tolerance is much higher as evidenced
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:51.360]   by the other data in the previous graphs in the paper.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:54.360]   So while this podcast episode is most certainly
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:55.960]   not about yoga per se,
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:58.580]   it's about flexibility and stretching.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:00.240]   Flexibility and stretching are elements
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.360]   within yoga practices.
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:04.720]   And of course, yoga practices involve breathing
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:07.460]   and mental work and a lot of other things,
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:08.400]   balance, et cetera.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.220]   It's a vast landscape as many of you know.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:14.400]   But I think that if ever there was a manuscript
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.780]   that pointed to the utility of something like yoga
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:21.940]   for sake of tapping into a particular set of brain circuits
[01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:24.200]   and mechanisms that could wick out
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.480]   into multiple dimensions of life,
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.440]   so day-to-day life, stress,
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.480]   challenges in dealing with all sorts of external stressors,
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:37.460]   career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera,
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:41.820]   excuse me, but as well for increasing range of motion,
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.320]   for increasing flexibility.
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:46.740]   So if ever there was a practice that one could embark on
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.920]   that would not only increase flexibility
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:49.940]   and limb range of motion,
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:52.280]   but would also allow one to cultivate
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:54.300]   some improved mental functioning
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.780]   as it relates to pain tolerance
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:58.160]   and other features of stress management
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:01.160]   that no doubt wick out into other areas of life,
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:04.320]   appears that yoga is a quite useful practice.
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:06.060]   And so for those of you that are interested
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:07.580]   in increasing limb range of motion,
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:10.040]   and you're already a practitioner of yoga, great.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.460]   I can imagine that someday there'll be another study
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.880]   like this one, and you'll be in that 10 or 15
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:18.520]   to 16-year practitioner graph.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.780]   You'll be that dot way out on the far end of the graph
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:23.720]   that shows that your insula is that much bigger
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:25.000]   than the rest of ours.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.960]   And therefore, your internal awareness and pain thresholds
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:30.140]   and stress management will be that much better.
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:32.880]   But of course, yoga isn't the only way
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:35.740]   to increase limb range of motion and flexibility.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.120]   Up until now, we've described a number of different ways
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:41.520]   to do that, and we've arrived at some general themes
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.360]   and protocols.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.980]   Again, those themes and protocols will be distilled
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:48.720]   into some specific and precise list in our neural network
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.340]   newsletter, but we can revisit a couple of them now
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:54.200]   just in summary and synthesis.
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.700]   Static stretching appears to be at least among
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.400]   the more useful forms of stretching.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:01.200]   So low or zero momentum stretching,
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:03.800]   typically at end range of motion.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.060]   I love this concept of micro stretching,
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:08.840]   even though it's just a couple of studies
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.120]   that have addressed whether or not high-intensity
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.260]   or low-intensity static stretch holds are more beneficial.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:18.160]   The idea and indeed the data that low intensity,
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:23.160]   so 30 to 40% of what one would consider painful
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.360]   appears to be more effective than 80% of that threshold.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.720]   Find that incredibly interesting.
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.960]   And then there's this idea of frequency.
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.120]   It really does appear that getting at least five minutes
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.880]   per week total of stretching for a given muscle group
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:41.160]   is important for creating meaningful lasting changes
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.720]   in limb range of motion.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:46.560]   And that is best achieved by five day a week
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:49.280]   or six day a week or even seven day a week protocols,
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:52.580]   but those can be very short protocols limited to say,
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:57.500]   three sets of 30, maybe in 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:01.500]   Although 30 seconds seems to be a key threshold there
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.720]   that can get you maximum benefit.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:05.720]   There is no need to do full 60 second holds
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:08.400]   unless you're doing fewer total sessions per week.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.340]   And of course, to always warm up or to arrive
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:13.000]   at the stretching session warm.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.280]   And then of course, there are the other forms of stretching
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:18.300]   that we touched upon a bit, things like PNF.
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:20.320]   And we talked about why PNF works.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.660]   Things like the spindle and the Golgi tendon organ reflexes
[02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:24.980]   that are built into all of us
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:26.760]   that we arrive in this world with.
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.400]   And of course, the other forms of stretching
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.960]   that are known to be effective and important
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:34.180]   such as dynamic and ballistic stretching.
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:37.920]   Again, stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.460]   in order to improve range of motion for performance
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:44.740]   of particular types of work that one is about to embark on.
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:46.600]   Typically that would be physical work,
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.540]   but a whole interesting and unexplored landscape
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:53.780]   is the extent to which changing limb range of motion
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:55.200]   and different types of body movement
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:57.620]   actually shape our cognitive abilities.
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.940]   And that will be the topic of a future episode
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:01.020]   of this podcast.
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.420]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:37.660]   Please also check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:39.140]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:41.840]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:43.300]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:45.900]   but in many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:47.260]   we talk about supplements.
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:49.500]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.700]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:54.240]   for things like improving the transition time
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:57.620]   and depth of sleep, or for improving focus,
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:58.860]   or for a variety of other things,
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:00.840]   including things like anxiety management.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:02.460]   For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:05.540]   has decided to partner with Momentous Supplements.
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:06.720]   First of all, Momentous Supplements
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:08.700]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:10.980]   They're used by various professional sports teams
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:12.300]   and they have contracts
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:14.700]   with various government organizations exploring the role
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:17.380]   of particular supplements in human performance.
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:19.420]   Second of all, they ship internationally
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:21.760]   because we know a number of you are outside the country
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:23.240]   of the United States.
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.260]   We hope that will be useful to you.
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:28.100]   As well, we wanted to have a single location
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:30.420]   where people could go to access
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:33.060]   the most often discussed supplements
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:34.900]   here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.020]   So while the full catalog of those supplements
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:40.700]   isn't quite available yet, many of them are available.
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:44.240]   You can find them by going to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:46.800]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.420]   to find supplements for sleep,
[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.420]   for recovery from exercise, for focus,
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:53.060]   and many other features that impact mental health,
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:54.640]   physical health, and performance.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:56.340]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:59.180]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:01.380]   At both places, I describe science
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.740]   and science-related tools that relate
[02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:04.900]   to some of the themes covered here
[02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:06.100]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:08.620]   but oftentimes I'll do posts that include information
[02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:12.020]   and tools not detailed here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:13.120]   We also have a newsletter.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.500]   I've mentioned this a few times during today's episode.
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.700]   It is the Neural Network newsletter.
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:20.940]   You can access that newsletter completely zero of cost.
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:23.180]   By going to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:24.260]   and sign up for our newsletter.
[02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:25.740]   You supply your email.
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:27.780]   We do not share your email with anybody else.
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:30.820]   We have a very clear privacy policy that you can find there.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:34.020]   If you want to see examples of previous newsletters,
[02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:36.260]   you can find them there without having to sign up.
[02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.300]   Again, that Neural Network newsletter comes out
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:41.860]   about once a month, and we use it to distill out
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.620]   essential protocols from the podcast,
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:45.940]   to synthesize information from the podcast.
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:47.700]   We do believe many people find them useful.
[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:49.740]   So sign up for the Neural Network newsletter
[02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:50.780]   if you're interested.
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:52.840]   So thank you once again for joining me today
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:56.420]   for a discussion about the neural and neuromuscular
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:06:00.380]   and connective tissue and skeletal aspects of flexibility
[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:01.580]   and stretching.
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:04.460]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:07.040]   [upbeat music]
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.620]   (upbeat music)
