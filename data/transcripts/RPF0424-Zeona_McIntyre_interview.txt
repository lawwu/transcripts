[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.320]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we're going to talk about financial independence and how
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.280]   quickly you can get there if you use the concept of synthetic equity and find the right timing
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   on an opportunity.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:01:06.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.200]   skills, insight, encouragement, and inspiration that you need to live a rich and meaningful
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.560]   life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560]   I am your host.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.560]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.520]   Today, we're going to tackle that financial independence in 10 years or less nut.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520]   It's a hard one.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.560]   Probably don't talk about it enough.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.800]   Today, let's do it.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.520]   As I have done shows in the past about that little 10 year or less statement that I have
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.040]   there in my little slogan for the show, I've emphasized that there are a number of different
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.320]   ways that you can get to financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.160]   I use the term financial freedom intentionally.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   I don't use financial independence there, although I do believe that you can become
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.120]   financially independent in 10 years or less.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   The paths to get there are generally going to involve a very high extreme savings rate.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.680]   If you can save 70 or 80% of your income, you could reliably become financially independent
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.600]   in about 10 years or possibly through the growth and sale of a business.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.480]   That also can be done in less than 10 years.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.440]   Many successful businesses are able to build and grow and sell out in less than 10 years.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.400]   Now, none of these strategies are without risk.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Entrepreneurship is risky.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.620]   There's no guarantee of success, but neither is there any guarantee of anything in life.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.840]   I don't use financial independence in my slogan to say financially independent in 10 years
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.960]   or less, although I do maintain it's possible.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.720]   I use financial freedom.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.960]   You can choose what financial freedom means to you.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   You can define what financial freedom means to you.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.200]   I've done entire shows where I've talked about some of the different stages of financial
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.760]   independence and financial freedom.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.220]   I've talked about different meanings, but that word freedom simply implies liberty,
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.520]   financial liberty.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.880]   I often associate that term financial freedom with the idea of being able to live life on
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.840]   my own terms, being able to do the things that are important to me when I want to do
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.040]   them.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.800]   I don't define it as having a job or not having a job, having a business, not having a business,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160]   having enough money in the bank to pay my bills for decades or not.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.440]   I define it more as a mindset, an ability to live life on your own terms.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:39.080]   I believe that financial freedom is absolutely achievable for anybody in 10 years or less.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   Is this just some fun idea or is there actually more meaning behind it?
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   Yes.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.040]   I want you to have a sense of self-control, a sense of autonomy, a sense of decision making.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.280]   One great way to get there is through the use of various approaches to business.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.160]   I don't think that everybody should be an entrepreneur.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.000]   I don't think everybody is prepared for that or has the emotional makeup.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.560]   But I think there are many ways where if you'll open your eyes and look around you, there
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.320]   are many ways that you can use resources that are at your fingertips and find an opportunity
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.120]   that will help you to build the life of your dreams, to live that rich and meaningful life
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.440]   now and experience the financial freedom that you desire in 10 years or less.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.320]   My guest today has done exactly that and she has used something that I term the concept
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.160]   of synthetic equity.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.880]   This is not original to me.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.920]   But the idea here is can you find a resource that's being underutilized and bring additional
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.000]   value to it and use somebody else's assets to build your own wealth?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.640]   Can you use somebody else's money to build your own wealth?
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.400]   The textbook example that I use is the concept of property management and that's exactly
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.460]   what this show is about, although it's property management in a different format.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.080]   The idea is you can become a wealthy real estate investor by owning and renting out
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.900]   your real estate units, whether they're houses, condos, whatever they happen to be.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.160]   You can do that.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.420]   But that's going to involve a lot of financial capital to actually own those units.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.680]   Now when you own those units, you generally are going to be managing them and you're going
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.340]   to be earning profits from them.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.480]   But what if you don't have any money?
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.660]   Can you get into the real estate business and experience the benefits of property ownership
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.160]   if you don't have any money?
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.880]   The answer is yes and you don't have to go out and do a no money down deal.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.720]   You can get involved in the real estate business if you can develop a skill and expertise of
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.540]   property management.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.480]   If you come in as a property manager and you can find clients, you may have the opportunity
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:01.880]   to manage their properties, take a percentage of the rents and have the benefit of real
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.380]   estate ownership without having to put up the upfront money.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.520]   You can benefit from the growth of rental rates as your rates go up.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.960]   You can benefit from a nice property based upon being able to rent it out.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.120]   And although you're going to be doing substantial work for that money, you'll be able to benefit
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.260]   from some of the aspects of real estate ownership, some of the ways that it's not a constant
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.280]   everyday amount of work.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.440]   And it's all synthetic.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.400]   You're using other people's equity to pull your own profits off.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.000]   So my guest today is Ziona McIntyre and Ziona has an interesting story where she did exactly
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.960]   that, but she has done it not with traditional rental houses.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.160]   She's done it with Airbnb and she's done it in a remarkably short amount of time.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   I met Ziona when I was at Camp Mustache Southeast 2017 in Gainesville a couple weeks ago and
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.840]   we sat down for about a 20 minute interview, which I will play for you in just a moment.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.480]   Sit back and listen and recognize that Ziona has built for herself a plan for financial
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.320]   freedom in a remarkably short amount of time.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   And you can do something similar, maybe with Airbnb, maybe with something else.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.880]   When I bring you ideas and business ideas, things like that, you need to recognize that
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.840]   these are all culturally and time dependent.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.720]   Some things might work where you are, some things might not work.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.360]   Some things might work in 2017 that didn't work five years ago and that won't work in
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.600]   five years.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.120]   But there are always, always opportunities around you.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.540]   And so look for the principles of what people who are successful in a various endeavor do.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.680]   Look for those principles and then seek to apply them in your unique context.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.400]   Before I play the interview, advertisers and sponsors for today's show, sponsor number
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.360]   one is Paladin Registry.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.440]   If you're looking for a financial advisor, it's hard to know where to turn.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.080]   Do you pull out the yellow pages or do the equivalent with a web search?
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   How do you know who's right for you?
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.640]   How do you know if a financial advisor is good or not?
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.960]   It's not an easy question to answer.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.720]   I don't have a full answer for you here in this ad, but at least I have a place for you
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   to start.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.920]   And the place for you to start is with Paladin Registry.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.460]   Paladin is a registry service for financial advisors.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.800]   These financial advisors submit to extensive background checks, extensive vetting on their
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.160]   processes, on their qualifications, on their disciplinary record, et cetera.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.440]   And they have to pass through these tests before they are listed in the Paladin Registry
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.600]   system.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.440]   Once they're listed, however, Paladin will send new prospective customers to them.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.480]   And so it's a win-win-win.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   You the customer win because you have a vetted, researched, credentialed financial advisor
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.920]   that you can work with and that gives you a higher degree of confidence when you're
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.120]   starting your interview process to find a good financial advisor.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.480]   The financial advisor wins because they're getting qualified clients and referrals, additional
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.920]   source of business, so they can spend more time giving financial advice and less time
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.720]   out shaking hands at cocktail parties.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.200]   Paladin wins because they get fees from the financial advisors in order to be listed in
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   their registry service.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.480]   And I win for telling you about it because I get a commission when you go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.520]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.200]   That'll automatically transfer you to a landing page where you'll put in your name, your address,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.880]   your phone number, your email address, and the amount of money that you have, et cetera.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.440]   Paladin will take that information.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.320]   They will find a couple of financial advisors that will work with a client like you and
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.800]   they'll put the two of you in touch and you take it from there.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.380]   You're under no obligation to hire them.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.960]   You're under no obligation not to hire them.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.440]   But they'll put you in touch and that'll at least allow you to start your interview process
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.320]   with a good qualified candidate.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.000]   So radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin or link in the show notes on your phone or radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.800]   Sponsor number two today is YNAB, the You Need a Budget budgeting software.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.320]   YNAB is awesome because it allows you to take the money that's in your checking account
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.640]   and systematically give each dollar a name, where it's going to go, what it's going to
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.920]   be spent for.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.840]   Question, does every dollar in your checking account right now have an assigned task, an
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.340]   assigned purpose?
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.320]   If not, you need YNAB and you can get a free 34-day trial at radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.400]   It'll let you budget the money in your account, not this mythical perfect month, the money
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   that's in your account.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.280]   It'll let you update and change your budget easily when things happen and don't go according
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   to plan.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800]   Free 34-day trial of the software at radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.560]   Ziona, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.400]   Yay, thanks for having me.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.260]   So we're here at Camp Mustache Southeast 2017, which has been this really fun gathering of
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.600]   all kinds of people who are pursuing financial independence, who are financially independent,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.800]   kind of have this early retirement financial independence theme in common.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.760]   I'd love to hear a little bit about your story.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.000]   How did you come into this world of financial independence?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.520]   What's been your journey up till now?
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.680]   I found Pete like 2011 and I just loved it.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.880]   I latched onto the idea.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.200]   Pete is Mr. Money Mustache for those who don't know.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Oh, sorry.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   That's all right.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.180]   I'm just a bag.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.300]   I think it actually goes back to my parents were always struggling with money and I just
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.220]   knew that I didn't want to take that path and I saw that there was other ways.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.220]   So I kind of was always looking for a way out.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.180]   I was looking kind of like what you talked about.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.660]   I was always looking for a get rich quick scheme.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.660]   But I didn't want it to be a scheme.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.020]   I wanted it to actually work.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.260]   I saw a lot of things out there that didn't really work and I was a little bit scared
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.940]   that maybe there was no way to do it.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.160]   But then, yeah, I found things like personal finance books.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.680]   I got really into Suze Orman and although now I think she's way too conservative, it
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   was a really good start.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.040]   Just get like a Roth IRA.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.080]   Just get some basic stuff.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:14.120]   But it wasn't until Mr. Money Mustache that I really blew it open and thought like, "Whoa,
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   okay.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.240]   I can do what he did.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.160]   I can be early retired by 30.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   I can really do this."
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.360]   I still hold the belief that anyone can do it within five years from like zero to like
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.760]   I think you can do it in a short period of time if you're creative enough.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.160]   I think a lot of people don't think that but I think it's possible.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.760]   - So why do you think it's possible?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.880]   - I just think there's so many ways to go about it.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.520]   I think it depends on how much you're willing to give up.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.440]   So it's like a different kind of struggle but you're struggling for a goal.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:54.800]   So for me, like we can get into this but I do Airbnbs, I do short-term rental.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.880]   There was a point when I started doing that that I realized, "Wow, I can cover all of
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:05.160]   my housing expenses," which was my biggest column of expense, "through Airbnb and more.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   It can pay me.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.640]   So why don't I just let that take care of itself and then know that I can get there
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.760]   really fast?"
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.560]   In having to do that, I had to hustle a bit.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.000]   It was like I was staying at friends' houses, I was dog-sitting all the time, I was doing
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.520]   anything I could do to rent out the space that I would normally be living in.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.920]   But I knew that that short-term struggle was going to get me there really quick.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.920]   And I was like, "That's it.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.240]   I'm doing it."
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.320]   So that was like my turning point when I was just like, "Okay, this is the thing that's
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   going to work for me."
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.760]   - Okay, so you started with Airbnb just renting out your personal house?
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   - Yeah.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.960]   So a friend of mine had done it for a year and he made $50,000 on his apartment.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.280]   And so then I was like, "Whoa, I am listening."
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.920]   And that was in New York City and I thought, "Maybe that doesn't work where I live."
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.080]   And I was living in Boulder, Colorado at the time.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.240]   I still live there.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.040]   But it was kind of perfect timing.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.240]   I had a roommate and she moved out.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.280]   And so I was at this place of like, "Well, I have all this furniture.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.660]   I could just have someone come in as an Airbnb and try it.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.400]   And if it doesn't work, I'll just get a roommate."
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.600]   And so it worked so well that I was like renting her room constantly.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.560]   And then I started renting my room too.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.640]   And I would like go between the two.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.560]   And then when that was too popular, I was like, "Screw it.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.800]   I'm going to stay at my friend's house.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.960]   I'm going to sleep on the couch.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.040]   I'm going to dog sit now."
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.160]   So whatever I had to do to get out of my house, which is slightly uncomfortable, but it's
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.560]   like this is my path.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.400]   I know it.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.320]   And there's a long journey since then.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.400]   That was like five years ago, but it's awesome.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   - So what were you trying to accomplish?
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.000]   Because a lot of people would say, "Well, what's the point of having your housing expenses
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.120]   paid for if you don't have a house to live in?"
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.360]   Were you trying to save money or were you trying just to cover your monthly mortgage?
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.240]   Or what was your goal?
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.640]   - So I didn't own the house at the time.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.960]   It was just a rental.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.000]   But for me, I wanted to do what Pete did.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.680]   So essentially Pete, or Mr. Money Mustache, he has this one blog that I love.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.720]   It's like the 4% rule blog about like how much you need to retire.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:09.280]   And in that, he was talking about like for his family, they need 25,000 a year as expenses.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.080]   And so to get that, they estimated they needed about 600,000 in stocks so that they could
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.120]   get the dividends and a paid off house.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.280]   And so that was the goal that I took on because I thought, "Okay, like 2,000 to 2,500 a month,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.280]   that's doable.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.920]   That's money that I could live off of."
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.200]   - Especially with a paid off house.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.520]   And so I thought, "Okay, let me take housing expenses out.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.200]   So I don't have to think about that right now.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.560]   Let's just work really hard to getting that 600,000."
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.240]   And so I was using Airbnb as a tool.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.360]   I was also doing massage at the time.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   I was a massage therapist.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.280]   But I was just kind of like, "Okay, this is my hard goal.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.840]   And if I can get there fast, then it's worth it.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.200]   It's worth the short term struggle."
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:57.360]   - So then the point of renting it out on Airbnb was the income, which allowed you to...
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.320]   You were saving the excess income over and above the rental payments that you were making
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.560]   towards your $600,000 goal.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   So then what?
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   What'd you do from there?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.760]   - Okay, so this is the gray area part.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.840]   But I was like, "Okay, I want to get to the place where I can afford to buy something.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.800]   So for now, I need to leverage this more."
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.080]   So I went out and I rented another apartment that I didn't own.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.640]   And I was renting and re-renting, essentially.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.680]   So I would go between the three.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.720]   So it was like whichever space was not rented, I was living in.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.000]   So it was either that apartment or it was the one that I originally was in, in one of
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   the bedrooms.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.840]   And I'd kind of do this cycle.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.240]   So that was a little inconvenient, but it kept working.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   It kept growing.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.760]   So it ended up turning into more apartments.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.240]   And then eventually I was able to buy.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.280]   And I knew I really want to be as in the right as possible.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.760]   So owning was the best way to do that.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.400]   So that was the goal, for sure.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.440]   - So during this process where you were working, right?
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.160]   You had a job as well?
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   - No.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   So I had finished, I was in massage school.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.600]   I had just finished massage school and I started a private practice.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.820]   So that was something that because Airbnb was already working for me, I had the privilege
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:16.680]   of not having to go, "Oh, I need to go get a job at a massage like Envy or something."
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:21.760]   I knew like, "Okay, I have income already and I'm not paying housing expenses.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.940]   Can I just try to build my own private practice now?"
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.640]   So I was using multiple streams.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.360]   And I had already been investing in Vanguard.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.940]   So I had stuff to fall back on too.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.120]   So it was kind of like, "Let's just try all this stuff and see what happens."
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.520]   - So where have things gone from there?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.920]   Are you still bootlegging apartments, breaking leases, subletting?
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.200]   - No, I'm trying not to do that anymore.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.000]   Now I own four places.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.920]   I'm buying a fifth one on the 20th.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.320]   I teach people how to invest in Airbnb and I manage a bunch of properties for people.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.960]   So instead of just like renting and re-renting, they actually know about it.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.040]   They come to me for it.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.160]   So yeah, I probably have like 15 that I manage.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   - So the rentals that you're managing, how do you make that arrangement with the property
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   owner?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   - Oh, it's so interesting.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.840]   It's like people just started hearing that I was doing it.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.440]   And so now it's just kind of built to this, is this like word of mouth thing.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.160]   And before, I don't know, yeah, I didn't have a website or anything.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   I just launched mine yesterday.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.140]   And so now people can officially find me and all my social media is up.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.360]   But before it was just really like Facebook or a friend of a friend.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.040]   They just knew that I had been doing this Airbnb thing so long that they thought, "Well,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.480]   I'm going to be out of town for six months, four months.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.280]   Why not have her rent it and let's just see if it does anything."
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.240]   So that's kind of where it's at now.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.520]   I charge a 20% fee to do it, but I can get a lot of money for people.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.280]   So it's a really good value.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.480]   - What makes...
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.080]   I would guess it would be because a lot of people I think have space.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.000]   And if they knew somebody, "Hey, I'm going on vacation.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.640]   I don't want to go through the hassle of setting up my Airbnb account.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.660]   I don't want to necessarily deal with it.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.560]   But I don't mind getting a little bit of extra money for my household.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.720]   I'm traveling, why not?"
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.040]   And giving up 80% of something is better than 100% of nothing.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.680]   So if they know that they're busy and they're not going to go through the hassle, then it
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.360]   certainly can work well.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.160]   Which by the way, I love that business model because it allows you to...
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.680]   I mean, what I call that kind of synthetic equity, using a resource that somebody else
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:37.000]   has, and you're profiting from the entrepreneurial endeavor without having to make the initial
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   investment.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   - Totally.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.960]   - You're basically doing what Airbnb did.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.380]   So the reason Airbnb has grown so rapidly and so massively is that they are providing
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:55.560]   the service that hotels were providing without the need for them to invest in physical infrastructure.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   And so then they have an opportunity to grow exponentially without the constraints of capital,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.000]   without the constraints of construction, without the constraints of property management.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.120]   Because they're just jumping in to stuff that other people are already doing.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.680]   Well, now you've taken that and you've jumped on the back of Airbnb.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   - Totally.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   All the middlemen.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.120]   - And so now you're just taking your little piece of the pie of a completely synthetic
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   made up business that you get profit from without having had to invest capital into,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.240]   which is absolutely fantastic.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.280]   - Yeah, I mean, I call that like the try before you buy method for a lot of people.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.360]   I'm like, "Hey, if you know people that want to try this Airbnb thing and they have a house,
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.120]   they have space, they're not willing to do it themselves, but they're curious about it,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.480]   then reach out to them and just start managing for them."
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.520]   And Airbnb has set up this new thing where you can be an official co-host.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.200]   - That was what I was next going to ask you.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.240]   So could you get your revenue directly from Airbnb or do the people just send you?
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.380]   - No, it's so easy.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.720]   So they can just route it right to your bank account.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.280]   It's so easy.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.600]   And you can use your own login rather than having to log in through their account.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.560]   So Airbnb makes it super easy for co-hosts.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.800]   And it can be a temporary thing.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.720]   If they want to shut you off, they just change the setting.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   - So what do you do as an Airbnb property co-host/manager?
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.120]   What do you actually do for the owner?
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.600]   - So I will look at their ad if they have one or I'll make it for them.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.040]   So if they have one, it's usually not optimized.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.760]   I've been doing it so long that I can go like, "Okay, you need way more photos," or, "These
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.320]   don't look that great," or, "Here's all these things that are awesome about your property
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.720]   that you're not talking about," just things like that that are important.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.760]   Also different ways to set settings for money.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.720]   So you need a high enough security deposit that makes sense.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.520]   You need to be charging per guest.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   You need to just...
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.200]   There's just different things.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.720]   Cleaning fees, making sure that's a little bit more than what you normally would pay
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.280]   because sometimes it's dirtier than it normally is.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.200]   So just things to consider that I think a lot of people don't.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.080]   And I know it right away because I've just been doing it so long.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.320]   So optimizing, creating listing, doing all the guest communication.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.240]   There's a lot of back and forth that happens with getting a guest ready.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.320]   Answering all their questions, getting them how to get the key and all of the things for
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.640]   the house.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.280]   Then I handle all of cleaning scheduling.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.440]   So that is one thing about Airbnb that's a lot to keep up is you've got to make sure
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.560]   you've got good cleaners and that they're going to be there on time and that they're
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.160]   going to make every cleaning.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.760]   Because sometimes it's two times a month, sometimes it's like 15 times a month that
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   you're getting cleans.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.360]   So you've got to have a good team for that.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.620]   And then the last thing is handyman stuff.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.280]   So just having a team of handyman that I can call at the whim if something needs to be
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.480]   fixed and managing that.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.040]   So if you're in Dominican Republic and it's hard for you to get a hold of somebody, you
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.200]   don't want to know that there's this toilet flood happening in your house.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.160]   I just got to take care of it for you.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.080]   You know, definitely stuff like that.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.440]   So you manage how many properties now at this point?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   15.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.080]   And you now also own your own property.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.760]   Yeah, it's going to be five.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.760]   So you're closing on a deal soon.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   Congratulations.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   Thanks.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.800]   So at this point you have a business that can pay your lifestyle, right?
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   Totally.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.720]   Actually, you know, if somebody wanted to just try out the whole management thing, you
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.240]   could pay your lifestyle probably with like three places.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   It's a lot of money.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   Wow.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   It depends.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   It depends.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   If you're mustachian, you could do it.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:36.880]   But lifestyle can be a very flexible term.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.360]   Some people need $100,000 a month.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.840]   Some people need $100,000 a year.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.520]   And some people need $1,000 a month.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.120]   Well, that's why frugality is such a beautiful muscle.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.080]   Because the moment you realize you have this power, it's like you can adjust the barometer.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.400]   It's like, okay, now I get to live in the middle and that's kind of cool.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.840]   And maybe I'm not eating out every night, but I could do it occasionally.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   If you need to shut that all down and live like the bare minimum, you know how.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.040]   You know, you're like, nope, I'm cooking all my meals.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   I'm not getting in the car.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.600]   I'm not buying new shoes.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.520]   And just do it temporarily until all of a sudden you have more money.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.040]   So you know, it gives you that flexibility of not being like, oh, I have to go get a
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   job tomorrow.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.560]   It's like, no, you kind of adjust as needed.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   And yeah.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.280]   What to you is the benefit of not having a job?
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.960]   Oh my God, there's so many.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.680]   I travel like five months out of the year.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.520]   I get to wake up without an alarm clock every morning.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   I get to work from home.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.240]   So there's zero commute.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.360]   I get to work from Mexico if I want, you know, and there's just so many things.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.240]   I'm the owner of my time.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.800]   I get to work at eight in the morning or, you know, midnight if I want to.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.840]   So and there's days that maybe there's three days where I didn't want to work or yeah,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.280]   I'm here at this workshop and I thought I'd get stuff done.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   I'm not getting anything done and that's okay because I can work a hard day whenever Tuesday,
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.920]   if that makes sense.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.640]   So when you work for yourself, you have all that flexibility and I think, you know, each
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.960]   person has its own, their own pacing.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.060]   Like some people work really good for four hours a day and you can choose that and other
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.800]   people work in the nine to five.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   I don't know.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.060]   I don't do well in that.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.120]   So it's like learning yourself and what you can optimize about the way that your body
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.640]   is and your functionality.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.780]   Where are you going from here?
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.300]   I'm going to St. Louis from here.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   Well, actually I'm going to Savannah with JD.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.840]   Let's be honest.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.120]   We're going to go do some fun road trip because I don't have a flight home yet and then I'm
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.420]   going to buy a last minute ticket.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.000]   I'm going to St. Louis to furnish my house.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.760]   So I'm going to write about that.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.720]   A lot of people are asking about the steps of getting a new house and I thought it'd
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.120]   be fun to like post a list of all the things you have to buy and you know, just all the
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   steps.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   Right.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.880]   So I think that'd be a fun process.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.360]   What about your financial independence journey?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.320]   What are your goals from here?
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.960]   They've changed a lot because I consider myself FI now.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.760]   Like I am working, but I like it and my places already make more money a month than I need
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.060]   to live off of.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.280]   So I consider myself good to go.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:20.640]   Yeah, I had a year, maybe like two years where I was only working five to eight hours a week
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   and I was considering myself at five then.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.720]   And then, you know, I, this is magical thing that happens when you're financially independent
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.560]   and then you just have all this free time.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.200]   People want to give you jobs.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.120]   They almost like don't get the concept.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.340]   They're like, well, can I pay you to like move this thing or can I pay you to like watch
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.960]   my dog or can I pay?
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.320]   It's like money just happens and business opportunities happen.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.560]   You meet all these people and then sometimes it ebbs and flows.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:54.720]   So I'm in a flux now where there's all these opportunities to like share what I'm doing
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.380]   and build a little business around that.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.720]   But I think in a minute I might scale back a little bit and do less.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.480]   So maybe I'm going to do less property management and more just investing and writing about
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.480]   investing.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.480]   And you get to choose that.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.200]   What do you do with all the free time?
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.440]   Oh, what do I do with the free time?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.960]   When I was like only working eight hours a week, I had to figure out a purpose.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.160]   I was kind of in this weird, like floundering place going like, oh, is this going to be
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   in my life?
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.520]   Like, what do I do?
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   I'm not like producing.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.840]   And I was thinking that I was finding my value in that.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.360]   And that was a weird place to be like, oh, if I'm not productive, then I don't, I'm not,
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.920]   I don't, I'm not worth anything.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.120]   And that's, that's funny.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.520]   And so then I had to get down to like, what, what is important to me?
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.960]   And I realized like, it's really about the people in my life.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   And I decided that like the meaning and the purpose of my life was coming from just being
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   available for people.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.960]   And so it was like, if somebody wanted to talk or if they wanted to go on a walk in
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.860]   the middle of the day, if they were going through a breakup or grief in their life,
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.860]   like I could be there.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.240]   If somebody just needed to like move or they needed to take their dog to the vet and they
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.480]   were stuck at their job, like I could be there.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.720]   And it was just kind of nice to be like that friend that everyone knew was available.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.080]   And so that was like a place that I was getting a lot of meaning at that time.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.400]   And you know, now I'm doing other things.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.000]   I'm teaching people and whatever.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.160]   But I think just relationships are really important to me.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   So that's it.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:34.280]   So your brand new website is ziona.mcintyre.com.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:42.200]   I'll link to that obviously in the post for this episode.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.600]   Any closing words of advice or perspective that you'd love to give to somebody who's
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:53.920]   out there saying it sounds so easy, Ziona, but frankly, I'm struggling.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.240]   I think it's like only the individual knows what they really need to be doing in their
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   life.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.400]   And I think it's about finding the things that you really have, that you're really drawn
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.000]   to, that you really desire and spending time just doing those things.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.880]   And if you're not happy in your job, I just feel like quit it.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.320]   Go part time, do something else because you really will have all these other opportunities
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   if you trust that you like open and make yourself available for it.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   Thanks for coming on the show.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   Thanks.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.680]   Take Ziona's information and take her story and as I said at the beginning, look for the
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.760]   parallels near you.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.120]   It may be Aaron B&B.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.920]   It may not be.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.600]   It may be something completely different.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.360]   But recognize the concept of what she's done, which is to say, "I have some assets around
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   me.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.400]   How can I take these assets and make them more productive?
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.160]   How can I take them and bring additional value to these areas such that I can earn some income?
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   Who needs what?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.720]   Who has a service that they need?"
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.920]   A lot of times when you're dealing with something like Airbnb, the benefit is that people don't
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.240]   want the hassle.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.320]   And one major thing that you can do to build a strong business is find things that annoy
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.560]   people and solve those problems.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.360]   You can get paid very handsomely for that effort.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.680]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.040]   If you would like to support me and if I've solved a problem for you or given you an idea
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.560]   that was worth some money, come on by and pay me for it.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:26.000]   You can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.920]   Also please, if you haven't done it yet, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.720]   Fill out my quick, it's about 20-second, six-question demographic survey.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.760]   I've just gotten the initial batch of results back from that.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.880]   Very, very interesting.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.360]   I have to really process that data and consider because it was very different than what I
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.640]   thought it would be.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.840]   So I've got to figure out what it means.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   I'll share that with you soon.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.320]   I'll share the results of that survey.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.440]   But I want to make sure it's very accurate.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.800]   So the way that I make sure it's accurate is if a broad representative sample of the
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.080]   listening audience goes to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey and fills that out.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.120]   Please consider doing that, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:13.320]   Be back with you soon.
