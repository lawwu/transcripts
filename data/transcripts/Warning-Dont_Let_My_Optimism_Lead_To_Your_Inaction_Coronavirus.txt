[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220]   Good morning radicals. Welcome back to the show today going to talk with you again
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.060]   about the
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.240]   COVID-19
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.500]   coronavirus
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.200]   pandemic and some bits of response to to that and the thesis that I want to share with you this morning is
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.960]   simply I don't want you to let my
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.200]   optimistic tone keep you from
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.200]   from taking things seriously and from taking steps of preparation in
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.920]   short my summary statement is it is definitely time to take the coronavirus extremely seriously
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.800]   I think that it is time to engage in proactive social isolation. I think that it is time to
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.200]   To go to what is Defcon 5?
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.160]   certainly
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.280]   If you really anywhere in the world
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.460]   And we'll talk about that in a moment, but I want to back up now that you know my thesis
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.860]   That's that's that's my point that I want to drive home to you
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.320]   and I went back up and give you just a little bit of preamble last night I recorded the show and
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   that I did kind of a brief overview was talking about the changes and I once again tried to strike an optimistic tone and
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.320]   Then I released the show went to bed. I was thinking about it during the night as I woke up early this morning
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.920]   I was just considering what I shared with you and I realized that I
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.560]   Have been striking an overly optimistic tone
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.080]   Partly because I am genuinely optimistic
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.440]   But partly also out of simple fear and self-preservation
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.600]   basically, I don't want to be seen as somebody who is
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.000]   Irrationally shouting fire
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.600]   Irrationally shouting the sky is falling etc. And that's a weighty responsibility and basically it comes down to my own personal pride
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.720]   The pride and the desire to be right and not to be one who shouts unnecessarily about a crisis
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.720]   When you are on record with your words in a public format people will remember what you've said and they will remember
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.440]   Whether you got things right or wrong. I think back to things like the y2k bug
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.400]   there were many people who saw the major risks of a y2k bug and
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   people
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.960]   Who took y2k seriously recommended people that they said, you know stock up you need to prepare the computers are gonna fail
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.880]   Everything's gonna fall apart, etc. And they warned warned warned
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.600]   for years and then when the y2k event arrived it was
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.440]   basically a non event
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.280]   Nothing happened basically
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.400]   now
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   that was a heavy load to bear for those people and I
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.800]   Being
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.920]   Being a late teenager. I then watched for years people get laughed at for taking y2k seriously
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.760]   For years, I watched people make fun of the people who bought a pallet of MREs and stored it in the garage for years
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.080]   I watched people
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040]   Who were in the public space be brought back?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.560]   Oh you you told everyone that y2k was gonna be a big deal and look you were wrong
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.640]   And in fact, I have actually asked people why they were wrong. I remember one time
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.760]   Dr. Gary North was on the program and he was a very loud
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.120]   Warner of y2k and I asked him one time I said
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.520]   Do you regret anything?
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.800]   They gave him the the moniker scary Gary for his intense y2k warnings and I asked him one time. I said do you regret?
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.200]   What you did with regard to y2k and his response and his typical Kurt
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.120]   one sentence way was something akin to
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   I would rather
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.600]   be
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   honestly wrong and
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   I can't say it exactly. I would rather be honestly wrong and know that I
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.560]   Did my best?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.200]   Then to be quiet out
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.160]   of fear and base and and feel like I shirked my duty and so that statement even though I've
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.840]   Made it entirely uneloquent
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.120]   The thrust of that statement has stuck with me for the years and I've tried to follow it and just as I woke up this morning
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   I realized I
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.640]   I'm giving into fear of not wanting to to seem like a person who is overly paranoid overly
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.000]   obsessed overly strong
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.040]   Because with the psychology of the thing if I'm if I'm wrong, let's say that I give dire warnings about kovat 19 and I'm wrong
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.600]   having watched what happened in y2k I
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.520]   Everyone remembers it it gets rubbed all over the face if I do a search for my name online
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.360]   There's a forum somewhere. This is what Joshua sheet said this crazy thing
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.480]   But but he was so stupid and then that forever is linked to me
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.840]   I go to apply for a job interview in 20 years and forever all of that is there
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   Just like to this day you can do a search for I don't know Gary North y2k
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.920]   And you'll find all these articles talking about how wrong he was
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.160]   Whereas if I'm cautious in my
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.960]   Speech if I'm fine if I keep my tongue bridled and don't say anything, you know
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.560]   I'm not I'm not the nail that sticks up then and everybody is wrong. At least I don't get singled out and
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.520]   I can kind of sit back and and
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.760]   blend in with the crowd
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   but I care more about
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.400]   being honest and being able to sleep with myself at night and and look myself in the mirror and and
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.200]   Respect the man who I see then I do about being wrong. And so I want to
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.920]   Try to that's why I'm re-recording what I have just said
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.120]   Today to try to articulate to you
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.520]   The risk of a global flu pandemic
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:19.720]   I am genuinely more optimistic about the risks of
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.800]   This particular global pandemic
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.200]   Than I was a few months ago
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.440]   because
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   this particular
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.640]   strain of the virus
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.080]   Does not seem to have the highest mortality rate
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.800]   That has previously been feared. This does not have the mortality rate of
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.720]   The black plague right the plague this does not have the mortality rate of
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.240]   Ebola it does not have that kind of guaranteed death sentence mortality rate
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.400]   That does not mean however
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.000]   That it's not extremely deadly
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.800]   The best data right now seems to indicate that of the people who
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.400]   become infected with coronavirus
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.240]   about 12% of
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:22.200]   Those who are infected will have severe symptoms and about 5% of the people who are infected
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.960]   Will have critical symptoms and need critical care
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.600]   With some number of those people dying
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.640]   Now we can find reasons to be grateful I shared with you last night
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.040]   I am thankful that children do not seem to be deeply
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.520]   Affected by this disease as the father of four young children. That's a an incredible
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.880]   Relief to me, but that does not mean that
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.960]   My life cannot be entirely disrupted with elderly people
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   Becoming infected with the disease. I
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   Have parents you have parents. I have one grandmother still alive. She's a hundred and six
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.080]   Now in one way if she she lives in a nursing facility
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.760]   She's a hundred and six if she gets infected
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.200]   With the coronavirus and she dies. I'll take comfort in the fact that she lived a long life
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:28.360]   It's hard to expect all that many more years when your grandmother is a hundred and six
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.720]   But that doesn't make it any less
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.360]   important
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.600]   The loss of a grandmother loss of other grandparents in a nursing facility is a very big deal
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.880]   I have parents my wife has parents
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.960]   Great grandparents and so we don't want these people to be infected. That's a tremendous loss of life
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.200]   And of course elderly people are not the only people who are at risk
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.280]   so even with a
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.200]   Death rate and again, we don't know that the death rate
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.680]   The death rate will not be known until years after the initial waves of
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.400]   Will not be known with with with a high degree of accuracy
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.880]   Until years after some of the initial waves have passed through and you can take an entire
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.840]   Population where you can study and say here are the antibodies in their blood
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.200]   We know that they were infected and we can see what percentage of those people died
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.800]   but a few percent of death rate is a very significant thing and
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.760]   It is in addition to that. It's very significant because it can make death rates increase for other things
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   one of the major risks of a
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.280]   Viral outbreak a viral pandemic is it places such a load on the medical system?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.600]   That the hospitals are full the doctor's offices are full
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.040]   The doctor's offices are full of people who might be infected with coronavirus
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.680]   And what happens is all of the rest of the normal medical conditions that people are generally
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.480]   Suffering from now they now receive poorer care. Perhaps you have a chainsaw accident and you
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.600]   you
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.080]   Generally, you could get cared for pretty quickly
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.200]   But now the chainsaw is probably a bad example
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.960]   Anything happens and you could have gotten previously care for pretty quickly because you go to the emergency room
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.760]   You could be entered into the emergency room. You could go to ICU
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.840]   You could have your needs met and there was sufficient capacity in the medical system to care for you
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.360]   But now something has happened. You've had an accident experience some illness heart attack chainsaw accident, whatever the case is
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.720]   but the medical system is so overloaded you wind up waiting longer and longer at the
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.580]   Emergency room the intensive care unit is full of people with pneumonia and they can't care for you
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.200]   so people die
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.280]   maybe I was talking with a
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.800]   client of mine who was sharing with me some inside information from some friends of his who are in the medical community and the first
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.640]   responder community and he was they were talking about how one of the biggest concerns is if the
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.120]   If the virus starts to spread within the homeless community. Well that can
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.600]   Completely overwhelm all of the normal first responders who have to respond
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.840]   Because there's not no other real medical facilities that are available
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.480]   Except that somebody passes out on the street and the cops call the EMTs and EMTs come to come and help that person
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:18.400]   So picture your city has 10 ambulances operating at any specific time, but it also has a large homeless population
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   But five of those ambulances are out taking care of homeless people who are passed out on the street due to coronavirus
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   Infections and serious illness because they often have other medical conditions poor nutrition
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.320]   Alcoholism tobacco use drugs, etc. And so
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.800]   Then you have a heart attack and somebody calls the ambulance and the ambulance is delayed in coming
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:47.720]   So so there's the direct medical risk of the virus and then there's the secondary medical risk of an overloaded
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.680]   overtaxed medical system coming in from
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.120]   From because everyone's taking care of the virus. There are other risks as well
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.560]   Hospitals are famous places for you to get infections
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.640]   They work really hard and they try really hard, but I'm convinced that hospitals are dangerous and then data indicates that out
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.680]   They're less dangerous. If you're having a severe heart attack, they're less dangerous
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.360]   If your leg just got chopped off or you had a car accident
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   They're less dangerous than staying on the side of the road
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.920]   But they're actually really dangerous places because there's lots of sick and infectious people there
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.240]   And so if your hospital is filled with sick and infectious people and you go in for something else
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   now there's a good chance that that becomes a center for you to
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.480]   for you to
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.440]   Become ill or medical errors, right? Medical errors are a leading cause of death in the United States
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.600]   Obviously everybody involved in the medical system would like to bring that number down
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.640]   But it's hard to be perfect all the time
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:54.520]   But it's a lot harder to be perfect and to get everything right when you're personally stressed as a medical provider
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.600]   You're overworked. You're working long hours
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.720]   The hallways are full of sick people that you're trying to treat - you're worried about having enough masks to put on
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.400]   It's just a nightmare scenario that goes on and on and on and on and on
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.520]   so
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.680]   Back to my thesis what I'm trying to impress upon you. I'm genuinely optimistic
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.160]   because
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:26.720]   Children are not dying as much as previously was feared and the death rate was not previously what it was feared and
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   For me personally, I have the luxury of being able to largely minimize and eliminate
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:40.240]   Almost any social contact. That's a real blessing. That's a real luxury. I
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.200]   Also
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   I'm gonna use the word panicked because I think it implies
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.640]   What I want to imply without the actual
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.440]   Denotation of the word being true. I didn't panic but I panicked back in January. I didn't panic. I didn't freak out
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   I responded. I mean I
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.080]   Responded back in January heavily when I started to see it
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.920]   I tried to maintain a lifestyle of preparedness
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.620]   But I don't have a bunker filled with three years worth of food largely because of traveling
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.640]   If I did if I was settled in one place and I had a farm
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.760]   I would have a bunker with three years worth of food in it
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.480]   but I don't and I have not been convinced that I should give up the
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.440]   Work that I'm doing in traveling in order to go and buy a farm with a bunker thought about it haven't done it
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:35.280]   So back in January, I saw the risk emerging and I said this is serious. I went stocked up on food stocked up on medical supplies
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.820]   Etc. Then in February, I saw it getting worse and I thought this is really serious
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.800]   And I went and I bought even more food and I bought more medical supplies. I bought
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   rehydration things vitamins
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.200]   increased the vitamin dosages for my family to try to
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:00.800]   Know whether it works or not, but try to build immune systems tried to make sure I mean we already eat, you know tons of
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.360]   of a diverse diet, but I made sure again, we're getting lots of nutrients lots of
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.000]   Vitamins to to to make sure that we're really healthy. I
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.400]   Tried to increase my hand-washing
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:22.280]   You just had trying to teach my children because children are just awful at washing hands and you you go over it again and again
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.000]   They don't do it, but try to teach them the the medical hand-washing techniques to my children. So look, you know children
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.360]   Had my wife do it again. Well, I've been away the last few days like listen here give them this video
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:41.520]   Here's this that we're trying to get our two-year-old to do to learn how to wash hands and interlace the fingers and rotate
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.160]   them around and do the thumbs and so I you know
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.960]   We'll see how it's gone
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.600]   Because they remember that stuff and then they you say go wash hands and they all race in there and in two and a half
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.040]   Seconds later, they're back at the table with soaking wet hands. You didn't do it
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.600]   I'm sure every parent knows the the struggle
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.000]   But for me, I freaked out I responded and
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.840]   Panic and freak out are not good words. I
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:14.840]   Responded vigorously back in January in February so that by the time February got around I felt pretty confident
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.560]   I felt like okay. I've done about all I can do for a flu pandemic
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.200]   I have the supplies that I need to just simply stay at home
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.840]   I have enough food that I can stay at home for months
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.560]   I have a property that my family and I we can happily just stay at home for months
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.920]   I have enough money that I can just simply stay at home for months if my business implodes
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.520]   I have years worth of expenses saved. I can just simply figure it out. I can start another business
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.640]   I can get another job. I can figure it out, but I'm optimistic that my business won't implode. I have big plans
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.480]   I plan to make way more money this year than I did last year. No matter what like that's the goal, but
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:55.120]   I'm prepared. I could stay at home. I could isolate my family. I did everything I could think of to
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:02.440]   Protect against medical needs. So again, I tried to boost my family's immune systems. I bought some
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.960]   Made sure that we're stocked up on medications to bring down a fever
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.480]   Just basic care that I felt I could do at home. I bought a
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.200]   What's that stuff the Pedialyte or PediAssure kind of thing
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.820]   I bought some of those drinks and things that are could be used for rehydration
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:26.100]   I figured that if I have a child who's really sick in addition to other things that this could be a helpful source of nutrients
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.400]   I bought an oxygen concentrator
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.240]   I don't know whether that would work or not
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.280]   But in my thinking about what can I do if there's an overloaded medical system?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.560]   And I've got a sick child or I'm sick or my wife is sick
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.280]   What can I do and it just seemed like an oxygen concentrator would be the best thing I could do
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.880]   I hope it was a waste of money. I hope I never need to use it, but I bought one
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.440]   I stocked up on masks. I stocked up on bleach. I got gallons of bleach
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:58.480]   I don't have a lot of like plastic sheeting to create a quarantine room, but I do have a plan for
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.880]   How I would quarantine a family member if it got sick. I don't honestly think we could do that
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.400]   It's one thing if I had a house full of adults that I could quarantine an adult in another room
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:17.360]   But I don't honestly see how we could actually do a family quarantine of a child and stick a child in a room and say
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.660]   You know, you're locked off here in this quarantine room. I don't think that's practical
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.520]   So i've done everything that I think I could do as far as I can tell
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.560]   You know have lots of water stored. I have water filters
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.000]   And I live in a place where there's tremendous access to food
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.520]   Um, uh all my you know, I've got food on all sides
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.320]   And so i'm not i'm not that worried about it
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.040]   And so for me doing that back in january and february I felt like I was
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.580]   Overreacting because no one else was doing anything. I felt that was overreacting
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.280]   But then I felt well prepared and I thought okay i've done everything so talked with my wife
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.960]   We went over our list. I said i've done everything that we can think of. Let's just go forward
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.520]   now since that time
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.320]   With the lower death rate. I felt that it was a real relief
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.840]   Like okay, it's not the black plague, right? It's not the it's not it doesn't have 50 mortality rate
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.920]   so I felt
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:17.120]   a real sense of relief and i've also felt a relief as i've watched the data improve in china and i've seen
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.240]   That some of the things that they've been able to do to beat things to beat to beat it now
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.520]   If the data is real, right?
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   That's always the question but i'm going to for now assume that it is I think what they're doing is working
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.960]   The extreme measures that they did were are working
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.840]   um
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.160]   That's what was going on in my psychology
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.680]   That said
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.360]   It's time to take it even more seriously
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.120]   Here is what I currently believe is happening
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.440]   all around the world
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.660]   There are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people who are infected who are spreading the infection
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.600]   And who simply don't realize it who are just starting to realize it
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.440]   But we're early in the reporting of the actual cases
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.620]   There's the lag between when somebody is infected
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.640]   and infectious
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   And when they actually experience symptoms
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.420]   And then there's a lag as to when they actually experience symptoms
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.560]   Versus when they actually seek medical care receive some kind of test and are counted
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.880]   so
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   It feels very hard
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.840]   To respond early. It's one thing for it was one thing for me to respond and stock up back in january and february did that
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.520]   but
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.560]   I did it rationally and I thought this is money that if I waste the money, okay
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.960]   I don't like to waste money, but i'll feel good
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.300]   Right. The biggest possible waste of money was I bought an oxygen concentrator spent 400
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.880]   But okay if I waste this i'll keep it around it might save somebody's life at some point
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.840]   And if nothing else I can give it to an elderly neighbor or whatnot
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.760]   But at least I knew the price tag
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.100]   But now we're at a point where you have to make lifestyle decisions
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:07.840]   And I think that the data and the evidence indicates that this is the time
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.480]   to engage in
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.620]   significant social isolation
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.880]   Now, I know that's harder for some people than others, but this is the time to do it
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.240]   If we wait
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:27.120]   Until the evidence is obvious that it's necessary there's a very good chance that it's too late
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.840]   That's why this is so hard
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:40.000]   In all the comments i've done on flu pandemics i've said and I've I've believed for years a a global
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.560]   viral outbreak
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.920]   is to me
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.900]   the worst
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.480]   Possible disaster that's practiced really that I can see an asteroid. Okay, whatever
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.880]   Um, I can't do much about an asteroid
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:22:00.720]   But of the of the things that has happened again and again throughout history a global flu outbreak or global viral infectious outbreak
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.000]   Is one of the worst things that can happen and for many reasons previously discussed
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.900]   But one reason is it's so slow moving and you can't be sure of what's necessary
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.980]   If there were a declaration of war
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:18.900]   From your neighboring country on your country, you would know that it's necessary for you to take action
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.620]   The news reports could show
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.740]   the tanks massing at the border
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:32.340]   If there were a nuclear explosion, you would know that that happened and you would know that your concern is warranted
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.500]   But right now everything looks totally normal
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.700]   As I record this episode i'm looking out the window of my hotel there are deer grazing in the woods
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.860]   there are
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:51.460]   Businessmen, there's a businessman getting in his car going about his day. There's a highway filled with cars
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.660]   Life looks normal outside
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.220]   Everything looks normal
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.740]   and yet
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.500]   we know
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.980]   There is a deadly little killer and millions of little cells that are deadly little killers
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.180]   Spreading all around and so you wonder what's too much and what's not
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.740]   Went down to breakfast this morning in the hotel
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.420]   Guy there coughing. Oh, I stayed 15 feet away. But is that enough?
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:22.980]   Right. Did he cough on the the silverware tray? I just washed my hands. Did I wash my hands again? It's maddening
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.780]   It's maddening because if you're going to take the the full measures
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.180]   It just causes disruptions to your lifestyle
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.100]   So I don't want you to think that my optimistic tone
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.640]   Implies that you should not take things seriously
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:49.700]   It feels weird right now to be the person who says all right, that's it. I'm not gonna go to this event
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.240]   It feels weird. It feels like an overreaction
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.380]   And I hope that it is an overreaction. I hope that it is
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.020]   But you've got to be careful
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.820]   But you've got to take that action
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:11.940]   Before you can prove that it's necessary in order for it to be effective
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.740]   This
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.980]   Outbreak this pandemic
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.240]   Is proceeding exactly like I always pictured it proceeding
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.860]   When I've thought about it in years past
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:32.100]   It's proceeding in the way that people who warn and talk about these subjects picture it
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   Have talked about it
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.700]   It's not a guaranteed death sentence
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.100]   Again, I don't I feel bad for picking on ebola like this
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.700]   But I just say it's not ebola. Ebola itself was not a guaranteed death sentence
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.580]   But it's not ebola
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.760]   That doesn't make it unimportant. That doesn't make it insignificant
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:02.020]   So what am I doing well right now i'm traveling and i'm hoping I can finish my business
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.780]   And get home. I don't want to be stuck in the united states away from my family
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.860]   So right now that's my number one concern
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.500]   and I kind of feel like
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.460]   I kind of feel like how a lot of travelers felt after 9/11 when all of everything was shut down
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:21.620]   I've got backup plans. Okay, how do I get on a boat and go across the ocean and get home if I can't fly?
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.820]   What happens if if uh country closes their borders?
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.060]   It's it's kind of an interesting scenario
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   You're very vulnerable when you're in transit
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   And I thought about canceling my trip, but I had the trip scheduled for a while and I thought that okay
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.700]   I'll be able to get in and get out before things get too bad
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.140]   I was watching it up to the last minute
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:42.100]   But just didn't seem like it was just didn't seem like it was quite time to cancel my trip
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:48.660]   And I tell you what, I feel like i'm i'm playing with danger that it i've got just a few days
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.380]   as countries continue to impose more and more travel restrictions, I
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.860]   I will breathe easier once I get home if I can't get home on an airplane
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.860]   It will be an interesting
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.500]   An interesting journey to get home. We'll see what happens
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.540]   So that's my biggest concern is you're simply getting home to my family and once I get home then
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.340]   I'm staying put
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:15.060]   I have encouraged my wife to go ahead and move towards
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.980]   Not total like i'm not trying to be
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:25.620]   like i'm not all the way to total social isolation isolation, but to to pull out of
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.340]   of unnecessary events
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.660]   Still figuring out if that's warranted watch it day by day
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.220]   but
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.220]   but I've gone to that and
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:44.900]   Basically, I'm going to the point of just trying to encourage family members and such to to to
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.140]   To distance yourself as much as possible
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.580]   I think that I don't quite think we're to the point of
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.900]   You know not shopping at all
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.740]   But we get most of our vegetables from a farmer's market. So i'll continue to go to the farmer's market
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.180]   That's a very low risk place. It's outdoors. It's not a lot of people
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:13.140]   So, you know most of our shopping is kind of in a in a strange circumstance compared to how most people shop
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.740]   We don't go to big have a lot of big stores and things like that
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:22.260]   So I think those things are relatively low risk and once again, I feel like
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.900]   Once again, I feel like just a little bit more time is needed. I think the next couple of weeks are going to make a big difference
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:34.420]   Although I expect this to go on for months. I think the next couple of weeks are going to make a big difference
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.260]   I
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.460]   hate
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.260]   the fact that these kinds of actions that
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.940]   I'm engaging in and that i'm encouraging you to engage in
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.900]   I hate that there is a major economic stress associated with it
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:56.100]   Right. I don't like to think about what would happen to the income of my farmers where I buy food
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:01.300]   If I don't come and buy food from them, I want to support them. I want them to get the money
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.420]   I want to have the good food. I don't want to eat rice and beans and flour
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.140]   But
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:13.540]   It seems prudent and I don't like the fact that these actions are almost guaranteed to cause economic hardship for
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.700]   for all of us
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.200]   With the constant ripple effect across the economy
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.940]   But it does seem prudent at this point in time
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.180]   This is simply not just the flu
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.220]   It's not just the flu
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:35.240]   People who say it's just the flu do not understand the multiplicative effects
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.020]   of a viral infection
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.380]   They don't understand compounding. I posted online last night on twitter
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:47.300]   That the next couple of weeks are going to be your living lesson in the power of compound interest
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   I think that's true
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:55.380]   And if you remember about compounding very early in the compounding chart, it seems like there's not a lot happening
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.800]   Well, the same thing is happening with a viral infection
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:04.180]   It seems like a lot of overreaction to the actual numbers, right? Doesn't it feel that way?
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:09.140]   You look around and universities are canceling classes. Schools are canceling classes
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.800]   Companies are stopping people coming together. It seems like an overreaction
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.820]   Unless you understand the compounding effects of a viral infection
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:26.980]   And the only way to get ahead of a viral infection is to overreact early
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.380]   I say it with emphasis
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:38.740]   Because even though i'm entirely intellectually convinced of that and even though i've been entirely intellectually convinced of that for years
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.900]   It is still hard to say that in public
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:50.680]   It's still hard for me to tell that to you because i'm scared of being wrong and i'm scared of being painted as a fear-monger
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:30:00.020]   Normalcy bias is a powerful thing
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.740]   normalcy bias is
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.520]   The inability to think that things could change drastically
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:14.420]   It's basically the idea that you blot out important information because you think everything's going to be fine
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.820]   And you can see this in a natural disaster
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.620]   There's a natural disaster heading for you a forest fire heading for you, but you think oh, it'll probably stop
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.500]   It'll probably go away
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.780]   The volcano is spitting ash. Oh, it'll probably won't blow up
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:33.460]   The floods are coming. Well, it probably won't be so bad. We've lived in this house for a long time. It's been okay before
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:41.140]   That's normalcy bias wanting to see things continue and we all have it and one of the things that the reason why i'm recording this
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.100]   again
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.500]   This morning after just talking about this last night saying, okay, that's it. I'm done with covid 19
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.940]   I'm going to talk about other stuff is that I see in myself
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.300]   How strong that normalcy bias is?
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.620]   I'm, so committed to not wanting to disrupt things
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:02.420]   That even though everything that I see around is proceeding apace
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.340]   As i've thought it would be for a bad event
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.440]   I'm, so
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.300]   Emotionally committed
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.780]   To not wanting to disrupt my family not running to disrupt our normal life
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.300]   Not wanting to disrupt my business not wanting to face those risks
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.580]   That I don't want to take the public
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.780]   positions and I don't want to take the
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:31.220]   The personal changes necessary for it
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.460]   But I think that it is warranted
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:41.540]   That's my advice
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.540]   I hope that this was the
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.100]   Hope that my tone is coming through
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.980]   Panic is not the right word
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.540]   Strong response and strong reaction is
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.260]   I have the luxury of
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.300]   I have the luxury of
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   having
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.340]   A simpler lifestyle than a lot of people back to the kind of the freedom of lifestyle
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.500]   I work from home. My wife works from home
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:17.140]   Our children work from home. And so for us that question of social isolation is much easier
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.820]   Than if I worked outside of the home, my wife worked outside of the home and the children were outside of the home
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.620]   I recognize
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.900]   How big of a decision it is to pull your children out of school
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:36.340]   I recognize how disruptive that is to the family. I recognize how disruptive that is to to your ability to work
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.260]   I recognize how disruptive that can be to your finances
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.940]   There are no easy solutions to this
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.180]   The easy solutions are gone
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.140]   If you're going to be put into financial
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.220]   distress
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.220]   Because you don't go to work for a few weeks
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.020]   It's too late
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:04.100]   The time to solve that financial distress from you're going not going to work for a few weeks was a few years ago
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:10.420]   Right the time to save a year's worth of living expenses was over the past years
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.940]   It's too late
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:20.740]   Just like it's too late to protect your if you are invested in mainstream stocks. It's too late to protect your portfolio from losses
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.780]   If you if you just stayed invested the whole time
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:29.220]   Stayed invested the whole time the time to make your plan for what you were going to do in a market downturn was when the
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.300]   market was good
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.700]   So if you're going to suffer pain
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:39.780]   And financial shortfalls because you don't have a plan for who's going to care for your children if you pull them out of school
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.700]   It's too late
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   I'm, sorry
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.340]   But it's too late
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:53.620]   Now even though it's too late what I mean is it's not too late to act but it's too late to have a smooth ride
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.500]   It's not too late to
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.620]   For you to respond, but it's too late for it to be easy
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.980]   When I've thought about talked about taught about
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.620]   disaster preparedness
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.820]   One of the basic themes that I have emphasized is if you prepare in advance
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.420]   The disaster that is so stressful for many other people
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.100]   Can be much smoother and more comfortable for you
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:23.060]   In most disasters most people survive
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.140]   Human beings are resilient human beings are creative
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.020]   Human beings are wonderful problem solvers
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:36.500]   And when when the pressure is on human beings generally figure out a way to solve their problems
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.700]   That you're going to solve your problem. You're unlikely to die in the
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.740]   Coronavirus you're unlikely to to have all the members of your family die
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.260]   But if you didn't prepare
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.220]   It might still be a little bit of time. But if you didn't prepare
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.000]   You're unlikely to be able to go through it comfortably
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.060]   And and that's what i'm talking about so what i'm saying is if you are a dual income household
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.640]   And you don't have any money saved. It's too late for it to be comfortable
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.340]   for you
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.440]   So now you're going to have to make some hard decisions
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.980]   Now you're going to have to figure out what do we do from here what precautions do we take
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:28.340]   Who's going to care for the children and you're going to have to figure out in your situation how to meet your needs
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.100]   and
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.220]   um
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   And do it in a reasonable way
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:39.140]   Again, I hope that my intent is coming through not to berate you but to point out to you
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:44.420]   That the time to go shopping for toilet paper is not when the shelves are empty of toilet paper
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   It's too late
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.300]   It's too late by the way
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   on that
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.460]   If you're worried about toilet paper number one
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.380]   Um toilet paper has been cheap for a very long time
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.100]   And you were foolish
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.100]   For not stocking up
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:12.260]   There is no reason why unless you're physically living in an rv there's no reason why
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.540]   You should not have stocked up on toilet paper
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.380]   In the past
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:24.740]   If you are in a situation where the shelves are stripped clean of toilet paper
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.860]   And you're worried because you have four rolls at home
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   you
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.600]   Have been behaving
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.060]   foolishly
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.740]   And you need to take responsibility for the foolishness of your actions
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:42.980]   Number two
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.860]   You don't need to pay huge amounts of money for it
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:51.060]   Just go and ask your neighbors if they have some toilet paper and see if anybody has anything to share with you or ask a family
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.020]   member
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.300]   The toilet paper shortage is not an not going to be a forever thing
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.780]   There I don't really think there's any reason why toilet paper has to be
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.980]   a major shortage
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.220]   Number three
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.500]   one of the best
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   Antidotes for one of the best
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.540]   Replacements for toilet paper is something like baby wipes
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   Only a
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.940]   Heathen philistine would use toilet paper in 2020 anyway
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.860]   At the risk of this being an unusual topic for a financial show
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.380]   I'm, not a heathen philistine and you shouldn't be either
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.020]   Baby wipes or some sort of wet wipe is a far
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.580]   better solution
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.940]   Than dry toilet paper for your toilet paper needs
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.580]   So I suggest that to you so look around for things like baby wipes and see if those are available
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.380]   Now it's my understanding that those are probably in shorter supply, but you might be able to find those
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.140]   so
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.460]   If you have children, maybe this is something but one of the things that i've always done is we keep some toilet paper
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.860]   but I always keep significant amounts of
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.980]   significant amounts of
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:03.300]   Baby wipes around let's keep a couple extra boxes of baby wipes and baby wipes last for a very long time
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.340]   Because unlike toilet paper where you go through huge amounts of it
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.780]   Very quickly you go through a very small number of those
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.780]   So perhaps that could be helpful for you
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:16.100]   If you can find that or if you can use baby wipes a small package of baby wipes will last you a lot longer than
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.180]   a bunch of rolls of toilet paper
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.420]   Number, uh, I can't remember what number next
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:26.360]   You can learn how to conserve and to use more modest amounts of materials
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:33.220]   When times when there are shortages one of the things that you can learn is just how well how much you can do with a little
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.740]   Bit and this is a really useful exercise for you to go through
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.780]   for example
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.420]   In the united states, we waste huge amounts of water all around the world. We waste huge amounts of water
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.100]   and
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.260]   It's it's only when you go into a situation where you're really conserving something
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:56.500]   Conserving money conserving water, etc. When you realize how much you actually don't need
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.780]   With my family at the time it was five our record is when we were rving
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:07.700]   We had a 51 gallon water tank in our rv and we stretched that 51 gallon water tank for
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.580]   Either five or six days
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.820]   Now some places in the world to do far less
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:20.740]   But you can learn how to be frugal. You can learn how to do more with less that can be a good skill for you to learn
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.380]   next
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.480]   It is entirely sanitary
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.780]   And workable for you if push comes to shove for you to use some sort of cloth
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.900]   as compared to paper toilet paper
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:40.660]   We've done cloth diapering for years used to gross me out the idea of it before I had children grossed me out
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.900]   I thought cloth diapers. Why wouldn't you just throw all the the crap away, right? But
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:50.100]   Um, then I became we we uh, we started cloth diapering and I realized it's not a big deal
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.580]   It's not a big deal and I often talked to my wife. I was like, you know one of these days
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.940]   We should just stop buying toilet paper, you know, dr. Mr. Frugal. It doesn't cost much but i'm like when you're already washing
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:06.740]   Reusable diapers and what we've done for years is also my wife would make reusable wipes to use as well
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.380]   just a flannel cloth and
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.140]   a flannel cloth
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.460]   That you wet with water before doing it. It just before using it. It just gives you a better result
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.540]   It's better than dealing with the paper products
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.580]   cloth diapers are objectively better
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.820]   Than disposable diapers the thing that we've changed on that and I say that as a parent of four children
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:34.180]   um, the thing that we've changed our minds on is when we travel we use disposable diapers and my wife hates them and
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.260]   The reason is they always leak
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.580]   There you're forever having a diaper blowout
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.780]   Whereas with cloth diapers, I don't want to say never but almost never
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:50.660]   Do you have a diaper blowout? They're just they work better. They're more functional and yes, they require a different system
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:58.100]   But they work better the same thing with with fabric wipes. I get so annoyed using disposable wipes to clean my baby's bottom
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.620]   Because it falls apart. Whereas a cloth wipe doesn't
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.460]   You have in your house a hot water supply
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.180]   you have in your house
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.020]   a dryer
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.660]   And you should have in your house a clothesline. So if you need to
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:19.220]   Just simply take some old rags some old shirts cut them into squares
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.260]   They probably don't need to be hemmed but hem them if you can
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:28.420]   And use fabric cloths and there are tons of people who do it use your washing machine hot water
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:35.400]   Use your dryer if necessary heat hang them out in the sun the uv light and they're entirely fine and entirely sanitary
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.780]   um use
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.340]   You can have all the just go and read what the cloth diapers learn with the types of soaps to use etc
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.660]   And you're good to go. So you need to develop
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:50.500]   It's a kind of a weird topic to be talking about but this is the type of skill that you need to develop
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.820]   in the coming days
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.260]   The skill of creative thinking and creative problem solving is a skill that you need to develop
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.740]   If you already if you don't have it
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:08.180]   Now i'm not trying to convince you. I we don't use reusable toilet cloths in our house. I've thought about it
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.580]   Um, I don't think it would be gross
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.580]   But we just haven't chosen to do it just like I we haven't you know, we don't do um
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.860]   Human, you know human or composting
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.300]   We don't do I don't do that
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.700]   But not because I don't think I could do it
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.580]   And I know about how to do it. I know how to do it safely in case I ever need to do it
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.900]   I'm teaching the live preparedness class and it was delayed for a couple of days
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.640]   But uh in the next class we're going to be talking about sanitation
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.220]   And one of the most important things that you need to think about is sanitation because in a real
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.660]   What i'll call a grid down emergency if you understand the term meaning that there's a breakdown of
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.460]   of services
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:57.300]   And just to be clear, I don't think that the flu pandemic is going to cause that I don't think it will
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.500]   I don't think that it
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:07.460]   I don't think that the flu pandemic is going to cause the electricity to go off the water to go off, etc
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.460]   Could it?
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.580]   Yes
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.100]   It could
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.900]   But I don't think that this particular version of the flu
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.820]   Is going to do that now if this version mutates
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:24.260]   Uh becomes more deadly it could result in that or there could be some other compounding effect
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.020]   If there is another disaster that's compounded by a flu
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.860]   Then of course it could but I don't currently think that's going to happen
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:37.320]   But in a grid down emergency your number one thing is got to or one of your highest priorities has to be sanitation
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.800]   How are you going to dispose of the unsanitary waste of your household?
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:47.380]   If you're used to just simply taking all your trash and putting it in a trash bag and putting the trash bag out by the curb
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.380]   What do you do with that trash when they're no longer collecting trash by the curb?
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.580]   There is a major risk right now
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:44:01.300]   To sanitation workers of the virus not garbage workers, but people working in the sewer system
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.500]   For example, it's my understanding that the data indicates that this particular flu virus
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   Is found in fecal matter
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.980]   Possibly also urine but fecal matter. This is one of the reasons why in the current scenario public restrooms are
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.860]   dangerous places for you to be
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:26.020]   In a public restroom anytime a toilet flushes. There is some amount of fecal spray some of the the substance of
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.540]   Feces that get sprayed around in a restroom now
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:36.580]   Usually that's fairly small it's higher in commercial restrooms where there's a fast flush versus the flush that you're familiar with at home
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.700]   but the virus is found in feces and so this
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:47.140]   Legitimately poses a threat right now to people who work in water filled water
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.020]   What's it called water treatments facilities and things like that?
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:56.900]   Because if a large number of people are infected with the virus their feces are carrying that virus and this airborne
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:04.420]   The airborne risk is significant to people who are working in wastewater treatment plants like that right now
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.980]   so
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.420]   public
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:14.900]   Restrooms as far as practice public restrooms are dangerous places for you to be you need to minimize your time in public restrooms at the moment
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.740]   um because of of this, um
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:24.100]   Again, the virus is in feces and you have fecal spray where there are
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.620]   Toilets being flushed so
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:33.640]   When you think about the problem, you need to have a plan in your family for how you would handle your family sanitation
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.140]   What would you do if your garbage were no longer being picked up? How would you dispose of the garbage?
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:45.860]   What would you do if your toilet's no longer flush? How will you dispose of your human waste?
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.380]   What's your plan? How will you keep your drinking water clean?
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:55.700]   If you and all of your neighbors are trying to figure out how to dispose of your human waste without the standard sewer systems
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.780]   that we're engaged in
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.920]   I don't think this virus is going to lead to that level of breakdown
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.980]   Unless it mutates or unless there's other some other compounding event
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.740]   I've said it four times. I don't think or that there
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.900]   But you need to think through circumstances like that
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.640]   So if you are finding yourself unprepared
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.980]   And you're freaking out because there's no toilet paper
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.400]   You have been
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.940]   short-sighted
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.940]   You have behaved foolishly by not stockpiling toilet paper
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.020]   And you are not engaging your creative thinking
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.900]   Or studying how to solve your problems yet
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:43.960]   There are plenty of flannel towels and flannel sheets available at your local Goodwill
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.900]   So if you're out of toilet paper
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.300]   Go to your local Goodwill
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.060]   Buy a flannel sheet
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.980]   Cut it up into squares
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.980]   Put a stack of them in your bathroom next to the sink where you can get them wet
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:04.180]   Use them for the appropriate business and put aside a canister to collect them and then take them to your washing machine problem solved
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.500]   Now that's one of the easiest things that you can possibly do
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.700]   How much harder is it going to be if you face bigger problems than that
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:19.460]   This is time to get engaged get in gear get serious
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.920]   And start working on the logistics of your situation
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.160]   I hope that you have taken precautions
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.940]   I hope that you have saved money
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.360]   I hope that you have stockpiled supplies
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.140]   I hope that you've done those things for the years
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:41.940]   If I have not i've tried to sound the the alarm as strongly as I could over the years
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:46.420]   Um, I hope that you've listened if I didn't sound strong enough. I'm, sorry
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.860]   The reason is just simply it feels weird to always be the guy who's talking about the weird stuff
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.940]   And I don't like to have that public reputation
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.300]   But learn from what you see the panic. It's just going to grow and it's going to grow and it's going to grow
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.740]   Until more data is known and then what I think is going to happen
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.780]   Is the panic is going to grow people are going to respond
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.580]   And then what'll happen is it'll start to die down because people will get tired of it
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.980]   That doesn't mean the risk gets lower people get tired of it and they figure I just got to move on with life
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.900]   That's what I think is happening in china right now. People are just moving on with life
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.580]   and
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.380]   They figured out some ways to potentially contain it
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:28.260]   But in other nations, we still got to go through the hard point
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.860]   Look at china. Look at italy
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.420]   United states canada
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.740]   That's what's coming for you
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.460]   Within the next few weeks
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.220]   Take it seriously
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.660]   Don't give into your normalcy bias. I'm fighting mine with all I can
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.620]   Take the precautions early
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:51.400]   The worst case is you miss out on a few weeks of social engagements
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:59.540]   I know the cost is higher with work and whatnot. Sorry. That's why you save money. That's why you keep your expenses low, etc
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.540]   I don't want to cause panic. I want to keep an optimistic tone
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.500]   But I do want I don't want to
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:12.600]   An optimistic tone because I genuinely feel optimistic and i'm committed to looking for opportunities in the midst of disaster
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.760]   My study of history tells me that there are always opportunities in the midst of disaster
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.020]   And if this disaster continues for months and months and months
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:27.380]   There will be some people who make their fortunes in this time, and I believe that's a psychologically healthy place to be
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.100]   But don't let that sense of optimism
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:37.540]   Cause you not to take practical steps to isolate yourself isolate your family isolate your employees if practical
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:43.060]   When the cost is higher and if you run a business where your employees are physical, it's more difficult
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:49.960]   You might have to take more risks. There just simply is no way around it to try to maintain for the benefit of your employees
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.500]   but
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.580]   Take the steps that you can take today
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.220]   and move early
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:02.260]   Even though it doesn't feel like it that gets necessary because that's what will ultimately protect you
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.380]   Be back with you soon i'm here to serve you got questions maybe um, I
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:13.780]   With my travel and commitments today and whatnot. My schedule is a wreck
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:19.060]   But as soon as I can I will maybe i'll try to host a live q a show and we could talk about some of your
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.500]   questions and feedback
