[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   In our consideration of these biblical doctrines, we come this evening to a new section of the
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.600]   particular doctrine with which we have been dealing on a number of Friday evenings, namely
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.960]   the doctrine of God. You will recall that we have considered what the Bible tells us
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.400]   about the being, the nature, and the character of God as he has been pleased to reveal that
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.040]   to us in the Scriptures. We have also considered the names which God has applied to himself
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:45.440]   as a part of this revelation of his essential being, especially in his relationship with
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.960]   creation. That, in turn, brought us to a consideration of the great and mighty and inscrutable doctrine
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.740]   of the blessed Holy Trinity. And we ended at that point last Friday evening.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.880]   Now I say, still considering the doctrine of God, we come on to the next section, and
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:22.000]   the next section is obviously this—the works of God, the activity of God, what it is that
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   God has done. That, of course, is, in a sense, the main theme of the Bible. Our whole object
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.920]   in these meetings is that we may come to know God and into a true relationship with God.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.040]   And that is how we do it. We start with what God has told us about himself. There is God,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   the blessed Holy Trinity. Well, now, we are here on earth, but where has the earth come
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.240]   from? Where has man come from? Well, the answer is that God has done something, the works
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:09.040]   of God. And this is a kind of subsection or a branch of this general doctrine concerning
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.880]   God himself. Now, the question is, what exactly therefore
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   comes next? If this were a somewhat smaller meeting, I think at this point I would cease
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.480]   to speak and I would put a question. And my question would be this. What do you think
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.040]   should come next? What do we proceed to consider? We are about to consider, I say, the works
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.600]   of God. What therefore comes in your opinion? I am taking time in order that you may think
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.840]   out your answer for yourself. What do you think comes next in the biblical sequence
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   and in the logical sequence? I may be quite wrong, but I imagine that if I did put the
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.880]   question, I think many would be liable to say, and likely to say, that obviously therefore
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.520]   we come on next immediately to the doctrine of creation—God creating the world and creating
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.000]   man. Well, of course, there is one sense in which that would be a correct answer, but
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.080]   actually it seems to me it is not the correct answer. Although you will find if you look
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.920]   up certain books which deal with these matters that that is precisely what they do. You could
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.040]   quote quite a number of authorities who do go directly from the doctrine of God's nature
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.480]   and character to the doctrine of God's works and immediately come to the question of creation.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.560]   But that does seem to me to be quite wrong. It is unscriptural, and therefore it is not
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   the right and the true thing to do. Before we come to consider the doctrine of creation,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.680]   there is something that we must consider before that, and we do so because the Bible tells
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.320]   us about it. It is this. The Bible, before it tells us in a sense what God has done,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.480]   tells us the character of all God's activities. There is a great deal in the Bible, as I want
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:26.240]   to try to show you, about the way in which God does things. And it is important that
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.720]   we should consider that before we consider exactly what he has done. I'll give you further
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:43.000]   reasons for that in a few moments. There are certain principles which underlie all God's
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.080]   works. God works always in a given way, and what he does is determined by these great
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:01.760]   principles, which always characterize his operations. In other words, before God proceeded
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:10.920]   to create the world and man, God had thought, and God had willed, and God had determined
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.240]   on certain things. I think, therefore, you will agree with me that this consideration
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.600]   must come in at this point. There were certain things that were decided in the eternal mind
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:33.200]   and counsel of God before he had done anything at all in the matter of actual creation. And
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.160]   it does seem to me, therefore, that this is the obvious chronological, if one may use
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:46.520]   such a term, it is certainly the obvious logical sequence which should be followed.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.840]   Now the description which is given in the Bible of God's manner or method of working,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:01.480]   or the character of God's method of working, is what is commonly called the doctrine of
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:10.520]   the eternal decrees of God. And that is what I want to consider with you tonight, the doctrine
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:23.560]   of the eternal decrees of God. These are the things which God determined, and decided,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.840]   and ordained, and decreed before he had done anything at all.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.560]   Now I want to admit very frankly and very freely that I am again calling your attention
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:47.360]   to an extremely difficult subject. I do not apologize for that, because, as I am going
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.520]   to tell you, this is not a question of choice. The business of a man who is expounding the
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:59.240]   Bible is to expound the whole Bible. But I do admit that it is an extremely difficult
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.480]   subject, and I imagine that that is why you have so rarely heard anybody speak about the
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.840]   doctrine of the eternal decrees of God. I imagine it is also the reason why many of
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.800]   the books do not include it. But, as I think I can show you, it is so scriptural that it
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.140]   must be faced. It is like the doctrine of the Trinity itself. It is beyond our minds
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:32.120]   in a sense. But, as we saw with that doctrine, because it is difficult, we must not avoid
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.680]   it. It is exactly the same with this. For your encouragement, however—and perhaps
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.800]   you do not need encouragement; I am sure you do not, and I should not say this—let me
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.020]   put it like this. I think I can promise you that some of these primary, preliminary doctrines
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.680]   are the most difficult. When we do come on to the doctrine of creation, and of men, and
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.960]   of salvation, from one standpoint it is very much easier, of necessity, because at the
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:11.400]   moment we are still dealing with the mind of the eternal. And, of necessity, we must
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:18.040]   be considering something which is beyond our finite understanding and the grasp of our
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.720]   puny and pygmy intellects.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.600]   Very well, therefore, I thought I ought to say just a word on this matter. Somebody may
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:35.800]   say to me, "In view of its difficulty and its inscrutability, why consider it at all?
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.660]   Why not take us straight on to the doctrine of creation, and of men, and of the Fall,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.680]   and of salvation? That is what we are interested in. That is what we really want to know about."
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.780]   Well, no, I think there are certain answers that must be given to some such objection.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.680]   My first reason for calling your attention to it is, as I have said, that it is revealed
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:05.600]   in the Bible. And because it is in the Bible, it is obviously meant for us, for our consideration,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.800]   for our study. It is something which we are meant to know and something which we are meant
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.520]   to believe.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:22.940]   May I put it like this, I wonder? Isn't it rather surprising, my friend, to notice
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:31.580]   and to consider how prone we are to read only parts of our Bible? I wonder whether you read
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.940]   that ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans as often as you read the eighth, if you are
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.620]   a haphazard Bible reader.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.180]   Now we have no right to pick and choose with the Bible. We have agreed already it is the
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.380]   Word of God, the infallible, uniquely inspired Word of God. If I believe that about the Bible
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.380]   from cover to cover, I must take my whole Bible. The fact that there are parts that
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.260]   are difficult and which baffle me, in a sense, must not keep me from it. I must read the
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:06.380]   whole. I must grapple with it all. I must try to understand it all. And as this great
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.940]   doctrine of the decrees is in the Bible, well, it is my business to study it and to try to
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.900]   grasp it.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.460]   Another reason for doing so is this, that I think you will agree with me when we finish,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:26.780]   that it will reveal to us fresh aspects of the glory of God himself. It will send us
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:34.540]   away, as it were, with a greater and a grander and a bigger conception of God, and that in
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:41.740]   turn will promote our worship of God. I am never tired of saying that I am quite convinced
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:47.820]   that the real lack in evangelicalism today is that we do not spend sufficient time with
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.540]   the doctrine of God. We are so interested in a subjective experience and subjective
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:00.660]   salvation that we forget this great doctrine of God himself, and it accounts for many of
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:07.300]   our troubles and many of our problems. The more we know about God in his infinity, the
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.580]   more we shall worship him.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:17.180]   Another reason for considering this doctrine is that it will save us from many errors.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.900]   Many of the errors which men have fallen into throughout the centuries with regard to salvation
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:27.180]   and many other questions have been due to the fact that they have never quite realized,
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:37.220]   as they should, the biblical teaching with regard to the eternal decrees of God.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:44.340]   My last reason for calling your attention to it is this, that, speaking for myself,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:52.580]   I know of nothing that gives me greater comfort, greater consolation, than the doctrine of
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:12:01.220]   the eternal decrees of God. I do not hesitate to say that there is nothing that gives me
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:08.780]   greater comfort than this, to know that behind me tonight, little creature as I am passing
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:17.420]   through this world of time, are the eternal decrees of God himself. There is nothing so
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.420]   comforting.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.540]   Very well, then, if that is why we are considering it, let me say just a word on how we are going
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:30.980]   to consider it, and this is most important. The first thing you have to do always when
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:37.420]   you are considering the doctrine of the decrees of God is to get rid of all your prejudices
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:43.340]   and to get rid of any kind of party spirit. What I mean by party spirit, of course, is
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.100]   that we all tend to take up certain positions and without knowing it we are sometimes much
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.860]   more concerned to defend what we think and what we have always believed than we are to
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.340]   find out the truth.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.660]   So as we approach this mighty doctrine, let us try to rid ourselves of prejudices and
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:07.100]   any labels or party spirits. The other negative I would impress would be this one. We must
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:15.500]   not approach it philosophically. I keep on talking about this. Philosophy is the greatest
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.460]   curse in the realm of the Christian faith, because philosophy, by definition, is something
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.500]   that always tries to understand everything as a whole. That is the quest of philosophy,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.580]   to span everything with the human mind. We are dealing with something tonight in which
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.940]   that is utterly inadequate. In other words, we have to realize as we approach this subject
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.780]   that there are aspects of it which we are not going to understand. We cannot understand
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:51.060]   them by definition. It is impossible for us to understand them. Therefore, positively,
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:58.100]   we must approach the subject with humility. We must approach it with reverence. We must
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.460]   approach it by faith and with a ready admission of our own limits. We must approach it with
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.620]   an open mind, seeking and searching for the teaching of the Scripture. We must come in
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:19.220]   a childlike spirit, ready to receive what is revealed to us and ready, may I add, not
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:26.020]   to ask questions beyond the revelation of the Scriptures.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:33.580]   I want to say just a word about that. Increasingly, I come to think of faith in this way. Faith
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:42.340]   is a readiness to submit yourself to the biblical limits. Faith is a readiness not to ask questions
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:48.260]   about things which are not revealed in the Scripture. Faith is that a man is prepared
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.980]   to say, "Very well, I'll take all that is given, and I don't want to know more
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:58.940]   than is given. I am content with the revelation." We have to approach this great doctrine in
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:06.380]   that way. We must stop at what is told us and not attempt to go beyond it. Above all,
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:13.420]   we shall have to realize that there are certain things which we, with our finite minds, will
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:20.260]   not be able to reconcile with one another. Now, I try to avoid technical terms as far
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:31.540]   as I can, but I must introduce just one this evening. It is the word antinomy, a-n-t-i-n-o-m-y.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:39.900]   Not antimony, but antinomy. What is an antinomy? Well, an antinomy is this. It is a position
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:47.340]   in which you are given two truths which you yourself cannot reconcile. That is an antinomy.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.180]   Two things stated clearly in the Bible which you and I cannot reconcile. There are certain
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:16:00.660]   final antinomies in the Scriptures, and as people of faith we must be ready to recognize
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.120]   that. If somebody argues with us and says, "Oh, but you cannot reconcile those two,"
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.980]   we must be ready to say, "I cannot. I don't pretend to be able to. I don't know. But
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.340]   I believe what I am told in the Scripture."
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:23.380]   Very well. How do we approach this great doctrine? Well, I suggest we approach it like this,
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.380]   that in the light of the things we have already considered about the being and the nature
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:37.120]   and the character of God, this doctrine of the eternal decrees must follow as an utter
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:45.820]   absolute necessity. Because God is who and what he is, he must work in the way in which
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:55.700]   he does work. In other words, all the doctrines in the Bible are consistent with one another.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.080]   And we must always remember when we are considering any particular doctrine that it must always
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.640]   be consistent with everything else. So as we come to consider what the Bible tells us
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   about the way in which God works, we must be very careful not to say anything that in
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.160]   any way is going to contradict what we have said about God's omnipotence and his omniscience
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.520]   and his omnipresence and all the various other things that we have agreed together are to
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.720]   be found in the Scripture. Very well. Now then, having said all that, let me come
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:35.480]   to a positive statement of the doctrine. And in order to make it clear to our minds, I
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.880]   am going to put it to you in the form of a number of propositions. I do this simply for
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:53.480]   the sake of clarity of thought. Here is the first. God has from eternity had an unchangeable
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:18:02.600]   plan with reference to his creatures. May I repeat that? God has from eternity had an
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:13.040]   unchangeable plan with reference to all his creatures. The Bible is constantly using a
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.400]   phrase like this, "Before the foundation of the world, God had determined certain things."
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:25.520]   That's it. You remember the phrase used by the apostle Paul about our Lord's birth,
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:34.840]   "When the fullness of the times was come." It was all determined, it was all planned.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:42.680]   Now to put this negatively, we can put it like this. God never does anything haphazardly.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:53.280]   There is never anything uncertain about God's activities. If I may put it in still another
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:03.240]   form, God never has an afterthought. Remember, we have agreed that he is omniscient and omnipotent,
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.200]   that he knows everything from the end to the beginning, so God cannot have an afterthought.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:17.720]   Nothing is accidental, haphazard, uncertain, and fortuitous. God has a definite plan and
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:26.400]   purpose about creation, about man, about salvation, about the whole of life in this world, about
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   the end of it all, about ultimate destiny. Everything that God has done and has brought
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:45.120]   to pass is according to his own eternal plan, and it is fixed, certain, unchangeable, and
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:58.080]   absolute. That's the first statement. The second is that the plan of God comprehends
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:18.280]   and determines all things and events of every kind that come to pass. Let me explain a little
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:29.120]   what I mean by that. If you agree that God has determined certain ends, then I think
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.320]   you will have to agree that he must determine everything that leads to those ends. If you
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.440]   believe that God decided to create at a given point, that he has decided that the end of
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.960]   the world and of time is to take place at a given point, if the end is determined, surely
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:53.600]   everything that leads to that end must also be determined. You realize that there is a
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   kind of interrelationship between all events and things that happen, and they all are leading
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:06.960]   to that end. So the doctrine of the eternal decree of God says that all events are ultimately
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:19.720]   determined and decreed by God. Now, this of necessity must include the free actions of
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:27.480]   free agents. If everything is determined by God, it must include, I say, the free actions,
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:37.360]   the voluntary actions of free and voluntary agents. Now, that is the fundamental statement.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.960]   Let me break it up a little. I want to give you the scriptural evidence for what I have
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:51.520]   just said. Now, with regard to the whole system, this is put very plainly and clearly by the
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.120]   Apostle Paul in the first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, in the eleventh verse. He
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.560]   says in the tenth verse that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he, God, might gather
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.720]   together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:17.040]   even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:26.400]   to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. God worketh
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:37.640]   all things after the eternal counsel of his own will. Now, that applies to everything.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:44.320]   Paul is speaking there of the whole cosmos being united in Christ, and he says that God
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.520]   is going to bring this to pass in that way, according to the eternal purpose of his own
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   counsel, his own will.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.880]   But let me give you some scriptural evidence to show you that God, in this way, governs
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   and controls and determines events that appear to us to be quite fortuitous, things that
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:14.080]   to us appear to be quite accidental. Listen to this. In the book of Proverbs, in the sixteenth
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:23.400]   chapter and the thirty-third verse, we read this, "The lot is cast into the lap, but
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:30.680]   the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord." We call a lot, don't we, a matter of chance
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:38.000]   and of accident? You cast a lot. Yes, says the scripture, the lot is cast into the lap,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:48.160]   but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord. Listen to Matthew 10, 29 and 30, "Are
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:55.240]   not two sparrows sowed for a fathing? And one of them shall not fall to the ground without
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:02.440]   your father? A little bird drops dead and falls to the ground." Accident, you see,
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   chance, not at all. "Not one of them shall fall to the ground without your father."
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.080]   The life of a little sparrow is in the hands of God, but the very hairs of your head are
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:22.100]   all numbered. There are events which appear to be quite accidental and fortuitous. They
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:30.360]   are controlled by God. Then take the free actions of men. Listen to Proverbs 21, the
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:39.840]   first verse, "The king's heart is in the hands of the Lord. As the rivers of water,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:48.280]   he turneth it wheresoever he will." The king's heart is in the hands of the Lord.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:55.240]   He appears to be free, but God is controlling him as he controls the very rivers. Ephesians
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.840]   2, 10 tells us that we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:08.000]   God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. In Philippians 2, verse 13, we are
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.080]   told, "It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good pleasure."
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.720]   But come to something still more extraordinary and striking. The Scripture teaches us that
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   even the sinful actions of men are in the hands of God. Listen to the evidence. Listen
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.800]   to Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. I am going to read you the twenty-third
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:46.400]   verse in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, Acts 2, 23. "Him,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:53.840]   being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:02.400]   by wicked hands have crucified and slain." Listen to Peter putting it again in Acts 4,
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:12.680]   27 and 28. "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:20.480]   Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:32.240]   for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done." Herod and
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.080]   Pontius Pilate and the children of Israel and the people were to do whatsoever the hand
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:46.400]   and the counsel of God determined before to be done. The terrible sin of those men was
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.760]   determined beforehand by the counsel of God.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.200]   And then you have a striking example of the same thing in the book of Genesis, you remember,
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:02.800]   the famous statement of Joseph to his brethren. You will find it in Genesis 45, in the eighth
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:10.600]   verse. Joseph, retelling the facts, turns to them and says, "So it was not you that
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.880]   sent me hither, but God." From our standpoint, it was they who had done it. They had done
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.800]   a very dastardly thing, a very wicked and a very sinful thing. They had literally done
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:27.280]   it for their own mercenary motives and as the result of their own jealousy. But, says
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:34.800]   Joseph to them, "It was not you that sent me hither, but God. The sinful actions of
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.280]   men come under this great eternal decree of God."
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:46.440]   Now, let us be clear about this. In view of what we have agreed already about the holiness
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:55.300]   of God and the character of God, we must say this at once. God does not cause evil in any
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:04.800]   sense or in any degree. He does not approve of evil, but he permits the wicked agents
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:14.240]   to perform it and then overrules it for his own wise and holy ends. Or, take it like this,
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:26.340]   if you prefer. The same decree of God which ordains the moral law that prohibits and punishes
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:38.860]   sin, the same decree also permits sin, its occurrence, but it limits it and determines
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:48.580]   the precise channel to which it shall be consigned and the precise end to which it shall be directed
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:57.300]   and overrules its consequences for good. The Bible clearly teaches us that. God decrees
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:03.020]   the moral law which prohibits sin and punishes sin. Yes, but he also decrees that sin is
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:09.260]   to be permitted, and he even puts that sin into a channel and determines its direction
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.800]   and overrules it all to bring his own great ends to pass.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:22.820]   Listen again to this question of Joseph and his brethren. Take Genesis 50 and 20. "But
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:29.380]   as for you," says Joseph to his brethren, "as for you, ye thought evil against me,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:38.420]   but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:45.380]   And I suppose in many ways the most striking example of it all is to be found in the case
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:56.260]   of Judas. Even the action of Judas is under this eternal decree of God, a free and a voluntary
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:06.980]   action on the part of Judas, and yet a part of God's great eternal purpose and plan.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:15.780]   Now that brings me to my next, which is my third general proposition. I've been illustrating
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:21.460]   now my second proposition, you remember, so I come now to my third proposition, which
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:34.860]   is this—that all the decrees of God are unconditional and sovereign. All the decrees
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:42.540]   of God are unconditional and sovereign. What I mean by that is this—that the decrees
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:49.380]   of God are not dependent in any sense on the actions of men. They are not determined by
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:55.300]   anything that men may do or may not do. God's decrees are not even determined in the light
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:02.980]   of what he knows men are going to do. They are absolutely unconditional. They don't
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:09.820]   depend upon anything except God's own will and God's own purpose. They are in no way
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:20.980]   dependent upon the actions of men or of creatures. But now let's be clear about this. That does
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:29.060]   not mean that there is no such thing as cause and effect in life. That does not mean that
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:35.860]   there is no such thing as conditional actions. There is such a thing in nature and in life
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:44.220]   as cause and effect. Yes, but what this doctrine says is this—that God has decreed that he
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:50.660]   should work even through cause and effect. The very cause and effect and free actions
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:55.980]   are a part of the decree of God himself. He has determined to work in that particular
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:03.820]   way. What God has decreed is this—that the end which he has in view shall certainly and
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:13.580]   infallibly be brought to pass and that nothing can hinder it or frustrate it.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:20.900]   Now let me give you my evidence for all this. Take the prophecy of Daniel, chapter 4, and
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:32.580]   verse 35. Daniel 4, 35, "And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:40.540]   doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth;
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:49.820]   and none can stay his hand or say unto him, What doest thou? Nothing can stay the hand
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:57.140]   of God or even question it." Listen to our Lord stating this very thing in Matthew 11,
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:05.580]   verses 25 and 26. "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:14.780]   these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father,
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:20.660]   for so it seemed good in thy sight." Why has God withheld these things from the wise
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.780]   and prudent and revealed them unto babes? There is only one answer. It is that even
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:34.100]   so it seemed good in his sight. Listen to Paul saying it in Ephesians 1 and in the fifth
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:40.100]   verse, "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:46.980]   himself according to the good pleasure of his will." I do commend to you a careful
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:55.220]   study of the first half of that first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians. Observe everything
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.940]   it says and you will find that everything that God has done is always according to the
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:07.700]   good pleasure of his own will, nothing else at all. It is all entirely of grace. It is
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:14.460]   entirely because of God's will and God's good pleasure. But, of course, you find this
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:23.180]   doctrine stated most clearly of all in this great and mighty ninth chapter of the epistle
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:29.180]   to the Romans, which we have read at the beginning. I want at this point to emphasize especially
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:37.220]   verse 11. You will find that it is a verse in brackets, but what a verse and what a statement.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:46.980]   "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:54.940]   of God according to election might stand, not of works but of him that calleth." Do
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:01.020]   you remember what he is saying there, what the argument is? What he is really saying
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:11.580]   is this, that God said the elder shall serve the younger because he had said before either
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:18.660]   of them was ever born, Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated. Why, you ask, did God
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:26.620]   love Jacob and hate Esau? Was it because of what they did? No. "For the children being
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:33.860]   not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:41.380]   to election might stand, not of works but of him that calleth." Before they were ever
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:49.020]   born, before they were ever conceived, God had chosen Jacob and not Esau. It has nothing
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.860]   to do with their works in any respect. That is the teaching. Or listen to it as he puts
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:03.820]   it again from verse 14 to verse 18 in this same chapter. What shall we say then? Is there
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:10.220]   unrighteousness with God? God forbid. God forbid that you should even think it, leave
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:18.540]   alone say it. It is impossible. "For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:26.780]   have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:35.140]   not of him that willeth, not of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy. For the scripture
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:41.980]   saith unto Pharaoh, even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:50.740]   power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore, he hath
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:37:00.540]   mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardneth." It is the purpose
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:12.620]   of God, unconditional and absolutely sovereign. Let me go on to my next principle, which is
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:22.220]   that the decrees of God are efficacious. Now this, of course, follows of necessity. Because
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:29.380]   God is a sovereign Lord, because of his omnipotence and his almightiness, his purposes can never
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:38.540]   fail. What God determines and decrees must infallibly be brought to pass. Nothing can
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:47.660]   prevent it, nothing can frustrate it. It is certain, it is efficacious. It is bound to
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:56.140]   come to pass. And that brings me to the next, which is this one, that the decrees of God
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:06.260]   are in all things perfectly consistent with his own most wise, benevolent, and holy nature.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:13.580]   I think I need not argue that, I simply repeat it. The decrees of God are in all things perfectly
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:23.460]   consistent with his own most wise, benevolent, and holy nature. In other words, there is
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:29.620]   no contradiction in God, there cannot be. God is perfect, as we have seen, and is absolute.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.540]   And all I am saying tonight fits in perfectly with all we have considered before.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:43.260]   Now obviously, as I warned you in the introduction, you and I here upon the earth, with our finite
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:48.960]   and our sinful minds, are confronted with a problem. It is this. Why did God decree
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:55.340]   to permit sin? And there is only one answer to the question. We do not know. We know that
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:00.260]   he did decree to permit sin or sin would never have taken place. Why? I do not know. It is
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:06.300]   an insoluble problem. But ultimately, we shall see it all perfectly clearly when we are in
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:12.700]   glory and face to face with God. Two things we can be certain of, and they are these.
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:19.440]   God is never the cause of sin. In Habakkuk 1.13, you will find that stated, "He is of
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.720]   purer eyes than to behold evil." In James 1.13, you will find the same thing. "God
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:34.960]   neither tempteth any men, neither can he be tempted." God is never the cause of sin.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.600]   The purpose of God, we can also be certain of, is in all things perfectly consistent
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:47.720]   with the nature and mode of action of his creatures. In other words, though we cannot
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:54.280]   reconcile it, there is an ultimate reconciliation.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:01.800]   The decrees of God do not deny the existence of free agents and free actions. All they
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:08.920]   say is this, that though God has granted this freedom, he nevertheless is overruling it
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:16.000]   all in order that his ultimate ends may come to pass. But you may ask me, how do you reconcile
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.400]   those two? I answer, I cannot do it. I know the Bible tells me the two things, that man
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:29.840]   in a sense is a free agent. On the other hand, God's eternal decrees cover everything.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:36.920]   Now I must come to my last proposition, which is this, that the salvation of men, and of
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:47.760]   certain men in particular, was determined by God before the foundation of the world.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:53.960]   He does this entirely of his own goodwill and his grace. I would again refer you to
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:01.540]   Matthew 11, 25 and 26. In John 6, 37, you have all that the Father giveth me shall come
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:08.200]   unto me. In John 6, 54 you read, "No man can come unto me except the Father which hath
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:20.560]   sent me draw him." In Acts 13 and 48 I read this, "And as many as were ordained to eternal
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:31.360]   life believed." In 2 Thessalonians 2 and 13 I read this, "But we are bound to give thanks
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.680]   always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:43.440]   chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth." Listen
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:52.520]   to 2 Timothy 1, 9, "Who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:42:00.960]   to our works, but according to his own power and grace, which was given us in Christ before
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:12.120]   the world began." But especially, and I want to leave you with this, the great statement
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:22.920]   in this 9th of Romans again, verse 19 to verse 24, the Apostle Paul preaching this great
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:30.640]   doctrine of the decrees of God, the eternal decree of God. Imagine somebody in Rome asking
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.000]   a question and saying, "I don't understand this. It seems to me to be contradictory.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.080]   It seems to me to be unfair. It seems to me that God is unjust if what you are telling
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:51.320]   me about these decrees is true." And this is the reply, "Thou wilt say then unto me,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:59.800]   why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? How can God decree everything and
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:08.840]   yet hold us responsible for what we do?" Here is the answer, "Nay, but, O men, who art thou
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:16.560]   that replyest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:22.920]   thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:30.360]   vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor? What if God, willing to show his wrath and
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:37.960]   to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:44.000]   to destruction, and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:52.960]   mercy which he had aforeprepared unto glory? Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:44:03.720]   only, but also of the Gentiles." That is the apostle's answer. That is the scriptural
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:12.960]   answer. That is God's answer, therefore, to us and for us while we are in this world
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:21.880]   of time. It is beyond us. We cannot grasp the ultimate working of God's mind. It is
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:27.240]   no use asking me, "Why this? Why that? Why does God raise up Pharaoh? Why does he choose
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:34.480]   Jacob and not Esau? Why does he punish us if all things are determined and decreed?"
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:42.320]   The answer is, "Nay, O men, who art thou?" You are pitting yourself against the mind
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:50.600]   of God. You are forgetting how small you are, how finite you are, how sinful you are as
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:58.080]   the result of the fall. You have to leave the ultimate understanding until you arrive
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:06.400]   in glory. All you have to do here in time is this, to believe that God is always consistent
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:17.920]   with himself and to accept what he has plainly and clearly told us about his eternal decrees,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:25.040]   about what he has determined and decided before he ever created the world or men.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:35.260]   And above all, I say, to realize that if you are a child of God, it is because God has
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:42.840]   determined it. And what he has determined about you is certain and safe and sure that
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:51.800]   nothing and no one can ever take you out of his hands or make him his purpose for good
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:46:03.400]   with respect to you. The doctrine of the eternal decrees of God before the foundation of the
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:15.320]   world, "He knew me, he knew you, and your name and mine was written in the Lamb's book
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:26.200]   of life," before the world was ever made, before you and I or anybody else ever came
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:37.600]   into it. Let us bow before his majesty. Let us humble ourselves in his holy presence.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:47.480]   Let us submit ourselves to the revelation that he has so graciously been pleased again.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.920]   Let us pray.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:47:02.760]   Almighty and ever-blessed God, we confess that we feel small and insignificant in thy
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:13.400]   holy sight. We realize that we have looked into things beyond our minds, beyond our very
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:21.760]   imaginations, and yet we thank thee for them. We thank thee, O God, that thou hast also
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:30.920]   told us that thou hast numbered the very hairs of our head. And we thank thee for the blessed
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:43.160]   sense of safety and certainty and security that we feel as the result of it all. O God,
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:51.880]   it passes our comprehension how thou couldst ever look upon us. We thank thee for the sovereign
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:48:02.040]   grace that has brought us to where we are, the grace wherein we stand, the grace by which
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:12.680]   we are what we are. Together we would ascribe unto thee again all praise and honor and glory
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:21.720]   and might and majesty and dominion and power in the blessed name of our Lord and Savior.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.840]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:36.800]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:45.720]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain life and earthly pilgrimage, and until we
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:58.520]   arrive in glory and see all things clearly and God face to face. Amen.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.600]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
