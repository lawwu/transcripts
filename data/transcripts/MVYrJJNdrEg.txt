Now I just need to work on upgrading my emotion expressing capabilities of the underlying human. This is the Love Experiment Podcast. And now, dear friends, here's Mark Zuckerberg.

[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.980]   So, I'm gonna try to express it.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.980]   I'm gonna try to express it. - Yeah, I mean, it's kind of funny.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.980]   I mean, it's kind of funny. - Yeah, I mean, it's kind of funny. - And it's kind of funny because that's like, that's all amazing.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.980]   It makes you, it makes us so much more immersive. It makes you realize that, like, perfection isn't the thing that leads to immersion. It's like the little subtle flaws, like, crackles and, like, variations in color and just-- - Yeah, wrinkles. Asymmetry. - Yeah, asymmetry. And just the different, like, the corners of the eyes, like, what your eyes do when you smile, all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:49.140]  , that kind of expression and all that. So, and we try to capture that with the kind of classical expressive avatar system that we have. That's the kind of more cartoon-designed one. You can kind of put those kind of expressions on those faces as well. But there's obviously a certain realism that comes with delivering kind of this photorealistic experience.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.980]   I don't know. I just think it's really magical.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.560]   I mean, this gets to kind of the core of what the vision around virtual and augmented reality is.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.820]   It's like delivering a sense of presence, as if you're there together,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.560]   no matter where you actually are in the world.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.780]   And I mean, this experience, I think, is a good embodiment of that,
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.240]   where it's like, I mean, we're in two completely different states,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.340]   halfway across the country, and it's just like, you know,
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.880]   it looks like you're just sitting right in front of me.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.080]   It's pretty wild.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.300]   - Yeah, yeah, I can't.

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:06:18.380]   It starts off with a small number of people doing these very detailed scans. That's the version that you did and that I did. Before, there were a lot of people who we've done this kind of a scan for. We probably need to overcollect expressions when we're doing the scanning because we haven't figured out how much we can reduce that down to a really streamlined process.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.380]   And it can be very difficult to do that.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.380]   We've got a lot of people who have done this kind of a scan for. We probably need to kind of overcollect expressions when we're doing the scanning because we haven't figured out how much we can reduce that down to a really streamlined process.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:48.420]   extrapolate from the scans that have already been done.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   But the goal, and we have a project that's working on this already, is just to do a very quick scan with your cell phone where you just take your phone, kind of wave it in front of your face for a couple minutes, say a few sentences, make a bunch of expressions, but overall have the whole process just be two to three minutes, and then produce something that's of the quality of what we have right now. I think that that's one of the big challenges that remains.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Right now, we're doing a lot of scanning, but we're also doing a lot of physical work.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Right now, we're doing a lot of physical work.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Right now, we're doing a lot of physical work.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Right now, we're doing a lot of physical work.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Right now, we're doing a lot of physical work.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Right now, we're doing a lot of physical work.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:07:18.460]   Right now, we have the ability to do the scans if you have hours to sit for one.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.460]   Right now, we have the ability to do the scans if you have hours to sit for one. And with today's technology, I mean, you're using a meta headset that exists. It's a product that's kind of for sale now. You can drive these with that. But the production of these scans in a very efficient way is one of the last pieces that we still need to really nail. And then obviously there's all the experiences around it. I mean, right now we're kind of sitting in a dark room, which
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.460]   And then obviously there's all the experiences around it. I mean, right now we're kind of sitting in a dark room which
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:48.500]   is familiar for your podcast. But I think part of the vision for this over time is not just having this be like a video call. I mean, that's fine. It's cool. It feels like it's immersive. But you can do a video call on your phone. The thing that you can do in the metaverse that is different from what you can do on a phone is doing stuff where you're physically there together and participating in things together. And we could play games like this. We could have meetings like this.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:08:18.540]  , and have some people physically there and have some people show up in this photo realistic form superimposed on the physical environment. I've got stuff like that is going to be super powerful. So we got to still build out all those kind of applications and the use cases around it. But I don't know. I think it's gonna be a pretty wild next few years around this.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:18.540]   I mean, I just I'm actually almost at a loss of words.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:18.540]   I mean, I just I'm actually almost at a loss of words.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.580]   This is just so incredible. This is truly incredible.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.580]   I hope that people like watching this can get a glimpse of like how incredible it is.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.580]   It really feels like we're in the same room.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.580]   Like there is that I guess there's an uncanny valley that seems to have been crossed here.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.580]   Like it looks like you.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.580]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.580]   I mean, I think there's still a bunch of tuning that I think we'll want to do where different people emote to different extents.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.580]   Right.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.580]   So I think one of the big questions is, you know, I think it's a really good question.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.580]   I mean, I think it's a really good question.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.580]   I think it's a really good question.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.580]   I think it's a really good question.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.580]   I think it's a really good question.

[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   I know you'd love to cultivate that community and you interact with them online outside of the podcast as well. But I mean, there's way more demand both to interact with you and to be able to do the things that you're doing. And I know you'd love to cultivate that community and you interact with them online outside of the podcast as well.

[00:35:40.080 --> 00:36:10.060]  ,
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.060]   and I'm sure you'd love to interact with the community more, but you just are limited by the number of hours in the day. So, you know, at some point, I think, making it so that you could build an AI version of yourself that could interact with people, not after you die, but while you're here to help, you know, help people kind of fulfill this desire to interact with you and your desire to build a community. And there's a lot of interesting questions around that.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   And, you know, that's obviously it's not just in the metaverse. I think, you know, we want to make that work, you know, across all the messaging platforms, you know, WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram Direct. But, you know, there's certainly, you know, a version of that where if you could have an avatar version of yourself in the metaverse that people can interact with and you could define that sort of an AI version where, you know, people know that they're interacting with an AI, that it's not, you know, the kind of physical version of you, but maybe that AI, even if they know it's an AI is the next best thing.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:37:10.100]  , you know, necessarily all get to interact with you directly. I think that could be a really compelling experience. There's a lot of things that we need to get right about it. We're not ready to release the version that a creator can kind of build a version of themselves yet, but we're starting to experiment with it in terms of releasing a number of AIs that people can interact with in different ways. And I think that that is also just going to be a very powerful, you know, a very powerful thing.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.100]   I think that that's going to be a very powerful thing.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   You know, a set of capabilities that people have over time.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   So you've made major strides in developing these early AI personalities with the idea where you can talk to them across the meta apps and have like interesting, unique kind of conversations.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   Can you describe your vision there and these early strides and what are some technical challenges there?
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:38:10.140]  , you know, I think that that's going to be a very powerful thing.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:10.140]   You know, I think that that's going to be a very powerful thing.

[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   It's going to take a while.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   We're going to just get to see how it evolves and what developers and different folks do with it.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   If you could comment, this might be a bit of a very specific technical question, but Lama 2 is incredible.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   It's the... You've released it recently. There's already been a lot of exciting developments around it.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   What's your sense about its release and what's the purpose of it?
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   What's your sense about its release and what's the purpose of it?

[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   Yeah, I mean, I think on the last podcast that we did together, we were talking about the debate that we were having around open sourcing Lama 2. I'm glad that we did. I think at this point, the value of open sourcing a foundation model like Lama 2 is significantly greater than the risks, in my view. We spent a lot of time doing a very rigorous assessment of the risks, and we're going to do a lot of things that we're going to do in the future.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   We spent a lot of time doing a very rigorous assessment of that and red teaming it.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   I'm very glad that we released Lama 2.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   I think the reception has been...
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   It's just been really exciting to see how excited people have been about it.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   It's gotten way more downloads and usage than I would have even expected. I was pretty optimistic about it. That's been great.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   Lama 3, I mean, there's always another model that we're trained on.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   There's always another model that we're trained on.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   There's always another model that we're trained on.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   That's been great.

[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:40.760]   I mean, for right now, we train Lama 2 and we released it as an open source model.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   I mean, for right now, we train Lama 2 and we released it as an open source model.

[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   Yeah, I mean, part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI is launch is having a diversity of different use cases, just so that people can try to figure out what's going on with the AI.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   Yeah, I mean, part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI is launch is having a diversity of different use cases, just so that people can try to figure out what's going on with the AI.

[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:10.860]   Yeah, part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI.
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:40.880]  , and I'm also excited to see, you know, the Internet, I don't know if you heard can get kind of weird. And I applaud them for it. So I get that. Yeah, it'd be nice to see how weird they take it, what kind of means I generated from this. And I think all of it is especially in these early stages of development as we progress towards AGI, it's good to learn by playing with those systems and interacting with them at like a large scale, like you said.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   Yeah, totally. I mean, that's part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   I mean, that's part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   We're starting out with a set. And then we're also working on this platform that we call AI studio, that's going to make it so that over time, anyone will be able to create it one of these days, almost like they create any other UTC content across the platform. So I'm excited about that. I think that to some degree, we're not going to see the full potential of this until you just have the full creativity of the whole community being able to build stuff. But there's a lot of a lot of
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   I mean, that's part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   I mean, that's part of what we're trying to do with the initial AI.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:40.920]  ,
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   and then we're going to see if we can get it to the full potential of the whole community being able to create any other UTC content across the platform.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   So I'm excited to take this in stages. I don't I don't think anyone out there is really doing what we're doing here. I think that there are there are people who are doing kind of like fictional or consumer oriented character type stuff, but the extent to which we're building it out with the avatars and expressiveness and making it so they can interact across all the different apps and they'll have plans and stuff like that.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   So I'm excited to take this in stages. I mean, I mean, that's part of what we're trying to do is that. I mean, I mean, that's part of what we're trying to do is that we're trying to get right to get to the full creativity of the full creativity of the full creativity of AI.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:58:10.940]   profiles, you know, we'll be able to engage people on Instagram and Facebook. I think it's just that it's going to be really fun.

[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   ÐšÐ¾Ñ€rector:
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   The thing that's novel is the ability to convey through technology a sense of almost physical presence. The thing that is not physically real is us being in the same physical place, but everything else is. I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[00:59:35.040 --> 01:00:05.020]   a physical world and the presence that we feel but also being able to combine that with this increasingly rich and powerful and capable digital world that we have and all of the innovation that's getting created there. I think it's super exciting because the digital world is just increasing in its capability and our ability to do awesome things, but the physical world is so profound and that's a lot of what makes us human
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   is that we're physical beings. I don't think we want to run away from that and just spend all day on a screen.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I just
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I think that gets to this somewhat powerful and that's a lot of what makes us human
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   I think that gets to this somewhat philosophical question about what is the nature of the modern real world. I think that gets to this somewhat powerful and that's a lot of what makes us human

[01:00:35.080 --> 01:01:05.060]  ,
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.060]   Yeah, I think just to linger on this kind of changing nature of reality like of what is real maybe shifting it towards the consciousness so what is real is the subjective experience of a thing that makes it feel real versus necessarily being in the same physical space because it feels like we're in the same physical space and that's the conscious experience of it that's probably what is real
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.060]   Yeah, I think just to linger on this kind of changing nature of reality like of what is real maybe shifting it towards the consciousness so what is real is the subjective experience of a thing that makes it feel real versus necessarily being in the same physical space because it feels like we're in the same physical space and that's the conscious experience of it that's probably what is real
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   real not like that the space-time like the physics of it like you're basically breaking physics and focusing on the consciousness that's what's real just whatever is going on inside my head. But there are a lot of social and psychological things that go along with that experience that was previously only physical presence, right? I think there's like an intimacy, a trust, you know there's a level of communication because so much of communication is non-verbal and it's based on
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   And I think it's like a little bit of a trust and a sense of intimacy, right? I think there's a level of intimacy, a trust, you know there's a level of communication because so much of communication is non-verbal and it's based on
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   It's based on the physical, right?
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   It's based on the physical, and it's based on the physical,
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   I think it's based on the individual, it's based on the physical, right?
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   It's based on the physical, right?
