[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.400]   And in this episode, I want to talk about my love-hate
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.080]   relationship with being a landlord,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.940]   owning physical rental properties.
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.520]   Because on the one hand, owning rental properties
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.120]   are one of the main reasons why I had confidence
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.800]   to leave work behind in 2012.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.580]   Today, rental properties, real estate,
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.500]   generates about 50% of our current passive income.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.800]   On the other hand, my rental properties
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160]   are my main source of investment stress.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.640]   It's not massive, massive stress,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.680]   but whenever I do feel stress, it's
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.400]   now because of my kids when they're sick
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.240]   and because of my rental properties.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.920]   There's really nothing else too much
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.320]   that stresses me out on a consistent basis.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.760]   There are random things like health issues for my loved ones
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.040]   that stress me out.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.920]   But everything else, there's not that much stress,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.380]   except for with my rental properties.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.760]   Whenever there is a tenant issue or a maintenance issue,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.740]   my mood naturally sours.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.940]   It's always these weird situations
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.880]   that always arise that are hard to predict.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.440]   And it took me about 15 years to realize how to protect
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.680]   my mood as a landlord.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.040]   Basically, I had to change the framing.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.680]   Instead of seeing my rental properties
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.820]   as a source of passive income, a wonderful source
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.160]   of passive income, I moved towards it
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.560]   being semi-passive income.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.600]   But this shift wasn't enough for me
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.280]   to feel better whenever some kind of tenant issue
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880]   or a maintenance issue arose.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.320]   So I took the framing a step further
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.080]   and changed it to see that my rental properties are actually
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.120]   a part-time job.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.040]   As soon as I had this mental shift
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.960]   of seeing rental property ownership as a part-time job,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.760]   things got better.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.720]   My mental health became more positive
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.160]   because whenever I needed to spend time dealing with rental
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.880]   property issues, I just said, well, I
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.800]   haven't done anything for a while.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.560]   This is a great part-time job.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   So when there is something to do, something to manage,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.720]   or something to fix, it's just part of my job.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.520]   And given I have pride in doing a job well done, like most
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.400]   of us, these issues tended to not bother me so much.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.080]   It's kind of a similar situation about walking very far
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.560]   downtown in San Francisco.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.920]   So in the past, I used to work downtown.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.040]   And I would take analysts around to see clients.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.600]   And the clients would be six blocks, eight blocks,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.080]   sometimes 10 blocks away.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.840]   Sometimes they're up on a hill.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.240]   But because it was part of my job and the analyst's job,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.560]   we just walked merrily for 15 to 20 minutes, no problem.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.240]   But when I'm in downtown San Francisco,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.360]   and I'm, let's say, meeting a friend,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   and I want to go to Union Square, which
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.440]   is like eight blocks away, I kind of am like, eh.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.840]   What a far way to go.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.360]   What a pain in the butt.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.600]   Because it's not my job.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.280]   So change the frame of mind in terms
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.640]   of owning rental properties as a part-time job.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.680]   And I think you'll feel better.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.880]   It's easier said than done if you actually do have a day job.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.840]   Because if you have a day job, you're like, OK,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.280]   owning rental properties is like a side hustle.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.080]   And the society today, including myself,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   tells everyone you should have a side hustle to earn more money
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.160]   to achieve financial freedom sooner because you
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.720]   can save and earn more.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.280]   Well, it's harder.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.440]   It's harder to view owning rental properties
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.920]   as a part-time job once you've retired because it feels
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.160]   like you're going backwards.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.120]   It feels like you're just going to go back and get a job.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.520]   And you can never be free until you sell your rental properties.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.320]   I get that.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.720]   You just have to get over the hump.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.080]   Maintenance issues, tenant turnovers,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.000]   tenant issues will occur for as long
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400]   as you own rental properties.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.160]   So you're just going to have to get right with it
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.960]   and treat it as a part-time job.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.320]   Just this August, I had my sister and boyfriend
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   come to visit from New York City.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.960]   They stayed at one of my rentals that used to be our old home.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.160]   The first floor is vacant, which I use as an office
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.320]   and as a place for friends and family to stay.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.840]   And it's worked out really great during the pandemic
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.440]   because I go there to escape.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.680]   And I go with my boy to play.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.200]   And we go to the hot tub.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.760]   And the upstairs is rented.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.000]   So supposedly, when my sister and boyfriend
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.680]   came in that night, they forgot to lock the side door.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.960]   Or perhaps they locked it, but it didn't fully latch.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.560]   And they thought they locked it.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.600]   But there's no proof that they did or did not.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.280]   99.9% of the time, it's no big deal.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.360]   Unfortunately, that night, a burglar
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.800]   went in through that side door and stole the upstairs
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.680]   tenant's $3,000 bike from the garage, which
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.800]   wasn't locked to anything.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.080]   Now, the security cameras somehow
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.000]   didn't pick up anything.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.920]   Nobody leaving or departing.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.760]   So there's also no proof a burglar stole a bike
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   because I didn't realize there was that fancy bike
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.240]   in the garage in the first place.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.120]   And you just can't help but think, well, is this real?
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.760]   Or is this not?
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.600]   Nobody was injured.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.160]   What's going on?
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.760]   The garage is a common area meant for a car.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.320]   But my tenants use it to store a lot of valuable stuff there.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.920]   We're talking $3,000-plus bike, thousands of dollars
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.560]   worth of skis, furniture, $1,000 of new tires, and more.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.400]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.880]   It's like a storage area.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   When we used to live there, all we had in the garage
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400]   was our car and paint cans.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.160]   So we're minimalist in comparison.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   So am I responsible for the thief's actions?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.920]   I think it's debatable.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.840]   All I did was provide my sister and boyfriend
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.360]   a place to stay for a week instead
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.040]   of having them pay $300-plus a night at a motel.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.320]   If you want to go to a hotel, it's like $600 a night
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.760]   here in San Francisco.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   So my good deed backfired.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.480]   And they didn't offer to pay anything.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.200]   And I didn't ask them to pay anything.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.120]   So luckily, my tenant had renter's insurance,
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.000]   which I require for all tenants.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.680]   If you're a landlord, please require your tenants
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.960]   to get renter's insurance.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   It's not that expensive.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.640]   It's like $100 to $200 a year.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.680]   So the bike, due to renter's insurance, was 100% covered.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.040]   And that's amazing.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.360]   So my tenant got a new bike.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.320]   And the bike that got stolen was, I think,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.000]   around three years old.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.920]   Not too old, but not brand new.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.720]   Not as good as a brand new bike.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.200]   So I thought the ideal was over.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.360]   But then my tenant asked me to pay for his $500 insurance
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.680]   deductible.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.280]   And so at first, I was taking it back.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.740]   I was thinking, are you kidding me?
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.480]   Really?
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.080]   I didn't feel responsible for a thief's bad actions.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.560]   Bad things happen all the time.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.960]   That's what life is about.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.500]   If a thief stole something of mine from the garage
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.440]   because my tenants left the garage door open accidentally,
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.120]   which they sometimes do, I would just chalk it up to bad luck.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.000]   It was my decision to leave things in the common space.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Further, I've always paid my insurance deductible
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.480]   when something unfortunate happens to me.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.400]   When I was a tenant a long time ago,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.080]   there was a leak in the ceiling.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.440]   And the leak leaked right on my laptop all night.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.840]   What are the chances?
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.000]   Well, the leak ended up destroying my $1,800 laptop.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.280]   So I filed a claim, paid the deductible, and got a new one.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.400]   I didn't ask my landlord for money.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.720]   I just chalked it up to bad luck and moved on.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.560]   Maybe I should have, but it's just not my personality.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.600]   I've always been very independent.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.000]   And I readily accept that bad things happen all the time.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.880]   Bad luck is a part of life,
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   just like good luck is a part of life.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.040]   Nor do I like to rely on anybody for help.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.360]   I've written articles such as
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.560]   the new three-legged retirement stool called You, You, and You
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.360]   and how financial dependence is the worst
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.120]   and why couples should have separate checking counts
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.080]   and couples should always be independent
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.680]   in making their own money.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.680]   Because you never know, the divorce rate is 50%.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.400]   If you end up being a stay-at-home parent
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.760]   for 10, 15 years, you don't keep up your side hustles,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.400]   your consulting, your skills,
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.960]   and then you go through a divorce,
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.320]   yeah, you might get a settlement from the divorce,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.560]   child support, and maybe, maybe a place to stay,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.480]   I'm not sure, but if you have no way
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   of earning your own money or earning a livable wage,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.120]   life is gonna be more difficult.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.720]   The whole theme on Financial Samurai
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.320]   is financial independence,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.880]   not financial dependence on someone else
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   or financial dependence on the government
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   or some random good benefactor.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.480]   It's being independent
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.560]   so that you can take care of yourself.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.520]   And if someone wants to help you out along the way,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.240]   that is wonderful, say thank you, give back to them.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.920]   But if nobody helps you, I want you to be okay
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.480]   because you didn't expect that help
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.060]   and you were able to figure things out on your own.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.880]   To me, asking money from anybody feels wrong.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.800]   It feels icky, especially if I have enough money
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.760]   to cover unforeseen circumstances.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.400]   But what I realized from being a landlord since 2005
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.560]   is that not everybody thinks like me.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.800]   Owning rental property makes you respect
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.360]   other people's points of view,
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.840]   and to be a good landlord, you have to be flexible
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.440]   and you have to compromise.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.880]   So compromise is what we did.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.480]   I offered to split the cost of the $500 deductible
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.640]   and he accepted.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.920]   And this is a tenant who makes over $300,000 a year,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.160]   probably over $350,000 a year.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.920]   And so to me, that's interesting
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.040]   because if I made over $350,000 a year,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.200]   I wouldn't have asked my landlord to pay a 500 deductible,
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.800]   which I think would have been my responsibility.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.080]   But again, I understand where they're coming from
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.680]   because if I never had my sister and boyfriend
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.540]   come and visit, maybe the theft would not have occurred.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.280]   So this story is another reason why
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.240]   I have this love-hate relationship
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.120]   with being a landlord and owning rental properties.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.600]   Something random, bad, usually tends to come up.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.960]   There's some kind of argument, a theft, something is damaged,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.480]   and it just really bums me out.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.080]   In another rental property,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.280]   the tenant found a leak underneath the kitchen sink.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.400]   And the kitchen sink was newly installed
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.340]   and remodeled in 2020.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.160]   But lo and behold, when my handicap came there
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.280]   to swap it out and check it out,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.840]   there were two big cracks on both sides of the P-trap pipe.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.080]   Like what are the chances of that?
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.560]   It's only been two years, but I'm thankful.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.160]   I'm thankful my tenant let me know
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.500]   because water damage is a big issue.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.800]   So if you wanna build passive income
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.560]   and retire early with rental properties,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.040]   you just really need to be in the mindset
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.520]   that bad things and issues come up all the time,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.880]   and it is a part-time job.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.340]   At least there's some lemonade to be made
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.000]   by writing a post, recording this podcast,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   and also I'm gonna update my future lease agreements
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.160]   to specifically say that tenants are responsible
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.580]   for their property in common areas.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.800]   I thought this was standard, but apparently not.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.320]   So if you have a lease, make that amendment,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.280]   click over to the post.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.120]   I've got a very thorough lease for you
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.040]   if you wanna use it as an example.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.500]   I also made lemonade by figuring out ways
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.800]   to bolster the security of the rental property
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.040]   because safety at the end of the day
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.800]   is the most important issue.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.640]   Funny enough, one security measure we agreed to
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.440]   of always locking the side door to the garage
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.240]   is not always being followed.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.880]   About 25% of the time I come over and the door is unlocked.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.960]   Another time I stopped by and the tenant's house keys
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.000]   and car keys were left in the front entrance
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.560]   for all passerbys to see.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.000]   So it was a good thing I was there
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.780]   to take them out and notify them
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.600]   because otherwise what other mishaps may happen?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.640]   So you can see how having to deal
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.280]   with these inconsistencies can be a real pain.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.560]   Alas, such issues are part of the job of being a landlord.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.240]   So you've just heard an example of a tough issue
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.280]   and why I don't like being a landlord.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.560]   It's why I've limited my self-managed rental properties
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.600]   to three because any more than three, I just can't take it.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.480]   So I highly recommend you discover what your limit is
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.640]   and don't surpass it because the joy you get
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.960]   from earning semi-passive income
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.880]   will soon become surpassed by misery
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.680]   if you own more than your limit.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.480]   And if you wanna go past your own self-managed limit,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.420]   then of course you can consider hiring a property manager.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.280]   I've got a property manager in Lake Tahoe
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.440]   for a vacation property and it is wonderful
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.360]   not having to deal with anything
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   and I'll gladly pay them the 25%
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.040]   of rental earnings as commissions.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.360]   With a love-hate relationship, let's talk about the love.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.320]   One of the reasons why I love owning rental property
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   besides the income and the potential appreciation
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.220]   is that there are fewer exogenous variables
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.020]   that will negatively impact the rental income
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.380]   and the property's value.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.720]   So we're almost three years into the pandemic
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.960]   yet China is still going through COVID lockdowns.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.600]   They've got a zero COVID policy, folks.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.040]   So if you get COVID or you're suspected
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.120]   of being in contact with someone in COVID,
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.320]   you're gonna be locked down.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.560]   You've got like this QR code, you've got a scan
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.680]   and if it doesn't turn green, you can't go anywhere.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.520]   If you look on social media, it's kind of terrifying
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.860]   to still have to be locked down in your apartment building
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.000]   and not go places for weeks at a time
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.100]   and it's almost 2023.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.760]   So appreciate your freedom
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.160]   and if you wanna appreciate your freedom more,
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.800]   go and see what's going on in China.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.280]   So because there's all these protests and riots,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   the S&P 500 sold off and you're thinking to yourself,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.840]   man, really?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.720]   The market has sold off because of this?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.320]   I mean, what else is next?
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.720]   A terrorist attack, another COVID strain,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.580]   government malfeasance and corruption,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.760]   something like FTX collapsing
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.740]   where customer deposits are being used
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.240]   in the owner's hedge fund.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   I mean, there are all these exogenous variables
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.000]   that you cannot control
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.720]   that can negatively impact your stock's share price.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.600]   And as a stock investor,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.320]   you're more than likely a passive investor
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.200]   because you don't have a board, seed
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.360]   and you don't have massive percentage holdings.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.720]   So you just gotta go for the ride, the good and the bad.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.940]   And being a passive stock investor feels great
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.000]   when your investments are going up, right?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.420]   You're just minting money and not doing a single thing.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.040]   But sometimes you feel hopeless and angry and frustrated
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.200]   and you just wanna do something
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.160]   when your investments are going down.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.560]   And unfortunately you can't do anything
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.800]   except for properly asset allocating
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.240]   based on your risk tolerance and your goals.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.720]   So I love that with real estate,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.600]   there are no supply chain issues in China
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.480]   or endless exogenous variables to worry about.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.180]   In fact, severe COVID restrictions
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.880]   actually helped rental property owners
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.480]   because more people demanded and appreciated housing.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.180]   Now, obviously there's a frustration
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.780]   regarding the Fed hiking rates aggressively
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.080]   and jacking up mortgage rates as well.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.520]   But other than the local economy and interest rates,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.560]   okay, the overall health of the economy,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.480]   there aren't that many variables to worry about.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.360]   Now, there can be natural disaster issues, right?
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.000]   And that is something that's, you know,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.880]   act of God, you can't control it.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.000]   But you can do something about it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.880]   You can buy homeowner's insurance,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.840]   fire insurance, earthquake insurance.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.440]   If you feel the risk is worth the premium
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.920]   or the premium was worth the risk,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.180]   just go buy insurance and cover yourself.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.980]   In conclusion, I do recommend most people
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.520]   follow the simple wealth building strategy
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.500]   of buying your primary residence to get neutral real estate.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.580]   Do it as soon as you find out that you wanna be somewhere
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.220]   for at least five years, if not 10 years.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.980]   And then after two to 10 years,
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.420]   rent out your home and buy a nicer primary residence.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.700]   And if you repeat this process in your lifetime,
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.140]   you'll be able to build a healthy rental property portfolio
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.900]   to take care of you, your children,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.340]   in retirement and beyond.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.700]   Sticking to an appropriate asset allocation
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.340]   based on your risk tolerance, age, time and goals
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.780]   is very important.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.460]   This way, money will seldom ever overtake your life
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.660]   so you can do more of what you want.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.020]   Thanks everyone for listening.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.060]   If you wanna invest in real estate 100% passively,
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.060]   check out Fundrise at financialsamurai.com/fundrise.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.980]   F-U-N-D-R-I-S-E.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.380]   The firm has over 3.5 billion in assets under management,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.520]   over 400,000 investors, and it specifically invests
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.780]   in Sunbelt Heartland Real Estate
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.300]   where valuations are cheaper and rental yields are higher.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.900]   And I do believe in the long-term thesis
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.060]   of investing in the heartland of America.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.340]   I've been doing so since late 2016
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.900]   and I'm planning to continue to invest
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.980]   in the heartland of America for the next 10 to 20 years
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.860]   because I think it's one of the key
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.940]   long-term investment trends of our lifetimes.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.540]   Thanks so much for listening and until next time.
