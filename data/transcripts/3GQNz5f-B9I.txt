[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:12.400]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in chapter 7, reading from verse 39 to verse 43.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.560]   Verses 39 to 43, in the seventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, "To
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:30.240]   Aaron," that's to say, to Moses, "to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrusting from
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.300]   them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, saying unto Aaron, Make us gods
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.080]   to go before us; for as for this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we want
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.120]   not what is become of him.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.380]   And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.800]   works of their own hands.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.760]   Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   book of the prophets.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.800]   O ye house of Israel, have ye offered unto me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.600]   of forty years in the wilderness?
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.720]   Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God, Ramphan, figures
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.280]   which ye made to worship them; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.320]   We are still considering this most important and vital speech or statement which was made
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.640]   by a man called Stephen, who was the first Christian martyr.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.480]   That's what you've got in the seventh chapter of this book of Acts.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.000]   The sixth chapter tells us of how this man was first of all, as a Christian, made the
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.560]   deacon in the Christian church, exercised powers given to him by the Holy Ghost, was
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.120]   a preacher, and a man enabled to work miracles.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.640]   Because of that, he had been arrested by the great court of Jerusalem, which was called
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.160]   the Sanhedrin, and they bring certain charges against him.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.800]   Here are the charges.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.440]   "For we have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.840]   This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, which is the
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.080]   temple and the law.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.880]   For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.680]   Now, that's the charge that's brought against him.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.280]   In other words, here is a man who's on trial because he's a Christian, because he believes
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.160]   the Christian gospel, because he believes that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.880]   son of God, and that God sent him into the world to save men.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.860]   The message was that this Jesus, who had been crucified and who had died and had been buried
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.860]   in a grave, had risen again.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.120]   They'd seen him, they were witnesses to the resurrection, they preached.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.600]   Jesus and the resurrection, and they were now fully convinced, as a result of the coming
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.040]   of the Holy Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost, that this is indeed the Son of
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.220]   God and the Saviour of the world, that he is the fulfillment of all the promises and
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.720]   all the types and shadows of the Old Testament.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.960]   They were proclaiming him as the one and only Saviour.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   Peter, for this same part, put it in these words, "Neither is there salvation in any
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.120]   other, for there is none other name unto him given amongst men, whereby we must be saved."
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.440]   They were preaching him as the one and only exclusive Saviour, and Stephen is on trial
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   because of this.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.560]   But you notice the particular form that the charge takes is that in preaching this he
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.520]   is going against Moses, the teaching of Moses, the great law giver.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.080]   So Stephen makes his defense, and the defense is, as we've been seeing for weeks and months,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.640]   that they've misunderstood their own history.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.920]   This is something nations are very fond of doing, misunderstand their own history.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.200]   The very thing they take pride in, they've misunderstood completely.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.560]   So he rehearses some of the outstanding episodes and personalities in connection with the long
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.000]   and checkered history, and gives them the true explanation of it all.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.120]   And in the case of this man, Moses, he has a great deal to say.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.960]   He goes over the history, and he shows them that they, the members of the Sanhedrin, are
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.840]   just with the Lord Jesus Christ doing the very thing that their forefathers have done
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   with Moses.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   For the facts are that the children of Israel were constantly rejecting Moses and refusing
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.260]   him and rebelling against him.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.320]   So he's able to show them very simply that in rejecting the Lord Jesus Christ, they're
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   simply perpetuating the ancient error.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.640]   That indeed the trouble with these people has always been that though they are the people
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   of God, they reject the word of God and follow their own devices.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.840]   And that all their calamities have always come upon them because they reject the word
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840]   of God.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.660]   Now, he's in particular able to show this, that Moses, this man whose memory they so
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.620]   revere, had himself prophesied the coming of this great deliverer.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.460]   Now that's what we've been looking at in verses 37 and 38.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.820]   This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, "A prophet shall the Lord your
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:45.580]   God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear."
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.380]   This is he, this Moses that was in the church, in the wilderness with the angel which spake
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.980]   to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   us.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.220]   But you see, he goes on to say, to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.220]   them.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.100]   Now, in other words, the case that Stephen is developing is this, and it's unanswerable,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.820]   that it is they who are rejecting Moses.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.540]   It is they who are going back on the teaching of Moses.
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.540]   Everything in the teaching of Moses, both in type and in actual expression, explicitly
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.700]   in words, all in Moses, was telling people to wait for the coming of this great deliverer
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.320]   and to listen to him when he came.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.060]   So Stephen is able to show that in rejecting Jesus of Nazareth, they are rejecting the
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:43.140]   one whom Moses had foretold, the deliverer, the Savior, the only Savior.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.580]   Now, that is the charge that he brings against them and that he develops in this way by using
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.200]   their own past history to show them the elements of this thing that is in the human race that
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.940]   constantly makes it go against God.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.060]   One may say, "What's all this got to do with us?
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.340]   Here we are, meeting on the 11th of June, 1967, and we've just been through a week
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.340]   of crisis.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.500]   What has all this got to do with us?"
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.120]   Well, I want to show you what it has got to do.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.620]   I'm not going to preach about Israel.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.620]   It's all right.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.820]   I've got something much more important.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.140]   I'm not going to preach on the relationship between Israel and Egypt.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.100]   I've got something much deeper to give you.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.620]   All that's been happening in this last week is but a manifestation of the ultimate cause
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.260]   of all men's ills.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.340]   That's the thing we've got to lay before us, and that's the thing on which we've got to
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.340]   concentrate.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:46.700]   All the troubles of the human race and of the world are due to one thing, and that is
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.100]   the rejection of the Word of God.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:56.220]   It doesn't matter whether it's the Word of God through Moses, or through Abraham, or
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.160]   Joseph, or through David, or through prophets, or psalmists, John the Baptist, or the Lord
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.540]   Jesus Christ himself.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:10.220]   It is a rejection of the Word of God.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.580]   That is why the world is as it is.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.780]   That is why you've had this last week and its events.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:22.020]   It has been the cause of all the troubles of mankind individually and collectively ever
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.740]   since men's original act of rebellion and disobedience.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.140]   Now this is the whole case of the Bible.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.780]   The trouble is the world never understands this.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:39.580]   It always will misunderstand the Word and the message of God.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.900]   And this is never more true than it is at the present time.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.580]   You would have thought that with a world such as this is at this moment, that everybody
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.020]   would be very ready to listen to the gospel.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.820]   We've exhausted what men can do.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.100]   You would have thought that people instinctively would turn to God and listen to the gospel,
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.100]   but they don't.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.100]   They reject the gospel.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.100]   Why do they reject it?
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.400]   Well, there are many, many reasons for this, but there are two in particular that I want
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.500]   to note this evening.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.620]   It is that their whole conception of the message is wrong.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   They misunderstood it.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.460]   Look at these intelligent members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.500]   They are deliberately rejecting the message concerning the Son of God as the Savior of
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   the world.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.720]   They're going to put a man to death because he preaches it.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   What's the matter with them?
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   They've completely misunderstood it.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:37.300]   And it is because men and women still misunderstand this message that they persist in rejecting
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.300]   it.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.500]   There are two main elements to this rejection.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   The first is that they've got hold of a curious notion that the gospel is something that promises
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.340]   to solve and to settle all our problems and all our difficulties, and to put the world
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.180]   in order.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.620]   That is the common idea with regard to the Christian message.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.700]   They think that Christianity is something that's going to put an end to war, solve
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.740]   all the problems of mankind, and we're all going to live happy ever afterwards.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.740]   That's one.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:18.660]   Another is, of course, that it is a message which brings to pass that desired condition
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:25.300]   by teaching us how to live, showing us what is wrong, and then telling us what is right,
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.340]   and urging us and exhorting us to do so.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.940]   Now, these are the two common ideas with regard to the gospel.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.080]   And I want to look at them.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.020]   The answer to the first, of course, is this, that the gospel, our Lord himself and his
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:50.100]   teaching and all who followed it and repeated it, the gospel has never promised to reform
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.780]   this world, never promised to put this world in order, never.
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:02.300]   Indeed, I could deduce much evidence to show to you that our Lord had preached and taught
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.500]   the exact opposite.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.900]   He said in the world we shall have tribulations.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.820]   He didn't promise that he was going to banish war and that the nations were all going to
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.820]   love one another.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.820]   No, no.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.820]   He said that there shall be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.060]   He prophesied the sort of time we've just been having this last week.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.620]   He, it was he who said things like this, "As it was in the days of Nod, they were eating
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.820]   and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and thought not until the flood came."
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:40.620]   It was he who said this, "As it was in the days of Lot, same thing, careless, carefree,
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:48.420]   drinking, marrying, giving in marriage, planting, building, selling, didn't think until the
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.820]   calamity came when it was too late to think."
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.420]   No, that's our Lord's teaching.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.220]   He has never promised to put this world in order.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.220]   Now, why is this important?
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.620]   Well, it's important for this reason.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:05.420]   There are so many people who reject this gospel because they say it's a proved failure.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.620]   You see, your gospel has promised to bring peace and to banish war and to put the world
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.620]   in order.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.620]   And yet, look at the world.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.620]   Here it is.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.620]   It's been preached now for nearly two thousand years.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.620]   Look at the facts.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.820]   You see, your Christianity is demonstrably a failure.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.420]   You see, that's all based upon the fallacy that Christianity has ever promised to put
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.420]   the world in order.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.420]   It has said the exact opposite.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.220]   Well, what does the gospel say?
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.420]   Well, what it says is this, that in spite of the fact that that is true of the world
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.020]   and that the world is under the judgment of God and is facing a final doom, that all who
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:51.220]   listen to the voice of God, and especially the gospel of the Son of God, can be delivered
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.020]   out of the world, can be translated from the kingdoms of the world into the kingdom of
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:03.420]   God's dear Son and are being prepared for a glory that is coming, which will be evident
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:09.420]   even on the face of this material earth, in some great day that is yet to come.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.220]   That's the Christian message.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   It is not world reform.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:19.820]   It is salvation for men out of the world, deliverance out of the world, and translation
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.020]   into the kingdom of God.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.020]   That's the first thing.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.620]   But take the second.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:31.620]   This idea that what the gospel really is, is just a teaching, a great idealistic and
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.620]   ethical teaching, and that what is needed is that it should be taught and propagated,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.020]   and men and women hearing it will say, "Yes, that's it, that's what we want.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.820]   We must now go and put this into practice.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.420]   We must either legislate the kingdom of God into being an act of parliament, or by means
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:55.020]   of our moral persuasion, we will persuade men to imitate Christ and to make a new world."
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.820]   Now, when you think of the energy that has been given to the propagation of that teaching
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.620]   in this present century alone, it is quite amazing and quite astonishing.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.220]   But you know it's got nothing to do with the gospel at all.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.220]   The gospel has said the exact opposite of that.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:22.820]   The gospel has said that men, far from liking the teaching of God, and rising to it, and
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:29.420]   being anxious to put it into practice, that mankind, instead of being like that, hates
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:35.820]   God, and hates his teaching, and doesn't want to have anything to do with it.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.820]   It goes even further, and says that even if a man intellectually may like the teaching,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.820]   he is incapable of putting it into practice.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.120]   Now that is the plain statement of the gospel.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.920]   So this idea that all you need is to confront mankind with a wonderful teaching, and then
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.420]   exhort them to put it into practice, and so make a perfect world, is a complete denial
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.420]   of the very essence of the gospel.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.620]   According to this teaching, man is entirely opposed to it, and he's completely impotent
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.620]   in the matter of putting it into practice.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.220]   Why is this?
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:16.420]   Now, this is the very thing that Stephen, in this masterly analysis, makes so plain
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.020]   and clear to us.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:27.620]   There is this unbelief in men, it's been there since the fall, which makes him persist
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.420]   in rejecting the word of God.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.620]   What is the cause of this?
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.620]   Well, we saw last Sunday night that the first cause is this, it's in the heart.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:43.220]   To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrusting from them and in their hearts, turned back
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.920]   again into Egypt.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.320]   This nonsense about people's difficulties with Christianity being intellectual.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.320]   It's just nonsense.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.020]   The trouble is not in the head, it's in the heart.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.220]   It's man's heart that decides what he is, and it governs and rules his head.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.520]   What we do with our heads is to put up a camouflage to justify what we like in our hearts and
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   what we're doing.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.220]   No, no, you mustn't say that the trouble is intellectual, because some of the mightiest
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.720]   intellects the world has ever known have believed this, and there are great intellects who still
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   believe it.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   It isn't intellectual.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.420]   You're fooling yourself if you think it is.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   The trouble is in the heart, it's lust, it's desire.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   That is plain.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.020]   They turned in their hearts back again into Egypt, and it's based in gratitude also.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.420]   But that isn't all, that's general.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:38.720]   Stephen goes on with the analysis, and my dear friend, if you really are concerned about
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.620]   your own condition tonight, and if you're concerned about the state of the world, if
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.820]   you're perplexed and in trouble as to why the world can be as mad as it is tonight,
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.420]   why people should ever think that they can settle problems by doing what's been happening
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.220]   in the last week, if you want to understand that, listen to this.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.420]   It's the only explanation of it.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   You'll get no explanation of it in the newspapers, nor in the clever interviews on the television.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.420]   They don't touch it.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.420]   They know nothing about it.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.420]   It's not political.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.420]   It's spiritual.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.420]   And here is a vastly analysis of it.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   Man is still doing what his forefathers have always done.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:22.420]   Stephen here analyzes it, lays it open, and here we can see why the world is as it is
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   this evening.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.420]   What is the trouble?
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.420]   Well, the trouble is, as I say, rebellion against God.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.420]   But why does man do this?
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.420]   Why does he behave in this manner?
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:40.420]   Well, Stephen gives us the answer, and here it is.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.420]   Man does this quite deliberately.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   That's the first thing we've got to grasp.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   He does it quite deliberately.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:55.420]   In other words, the trouble with mankind is not its ignorance.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   The trouble with men is not that he lacks information.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.420]   Now, that's been the popular creed.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.420]   That was the thing taught by the men like the late Mr. H. G. Wells and many others,
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.420]   that the world behaves as it does because it's lack of knowledge.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   You see, their idea was, and how completely fatuous it looks tonight, these men who flourish
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.420]   towards the end of the Victorian and particularly in the Edwardian period, their whole idea
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.420]   was this.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.420]   They said people fight and you get wars because mankind is ignorant.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   And if it only thought, if it only used its brains, it would stop doing this.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   And the solvent for all our troubles was education.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   An educated mankind, they said, will be incapable of war.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   The moment a man thinks he'll see how monstrous war is, how completely ridiculous it is, he'll
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   never do it again.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.420]   He'll banish it.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.420]   He'll stop it.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.420]   So, we put our faith in education.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   Give the people the knowledge and the information.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   Show them what war really is and they'll stop fighting.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.420]   There's no need to waste time over this, is there?
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.420]   We know by now that it isn't that.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.420]   No, no, it's not ignorance.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   The problem is not ignorance.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.420]   It's a lack of information and of knowledge.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.420]   It never has been, of course.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.420]   Man has always known these things.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:25.420]   But he's deliberately chosen to do these things in spite of what he knows.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:31.420]   He deliberately rejects God's way with scorn and sarcasm.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.420]   Now, the world cannot plead ignorance.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   Look at this book, the Bible, one of the oldest books in the world.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.420]   It's been confronting mankind for many centuries.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.420]   Here it is.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   Its message is open.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   It's been translated into English so long.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   I remember in 1938 celebrating the quarter centenary of the giving of the open Bible
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.420]   to the people of England.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.420]   Four hundred years we've had it open.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.420]   You can't plead ignorance.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.420]   Here is an analysis of your ills.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.420]   Here is an exposure of them.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   Here is the proper remedy, the only remedy that works.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   It's been facing mankind.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   Now, there has been preaching, preaching for nearly two thousand years.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.420]   The message has been sent forth.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.420]   There's the great story of the martyrs and the confessors.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.420]   All this has been known.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.420]   No, no, man rejects God's way deliberately.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.420]   Deliberately.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.420]   It isn't lack of knowledge.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.420]   It isn't lack of information.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.420]   What is it?
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.420]   Why does man do this?
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   Here is the problem.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   And there's only one answer to it.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   And that is because man is a fool.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.420]   I've got to use plain language.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.420]   Because I'm a man myself.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.420]   And I, by nature, am a fool.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   All men, by nature, are fools.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.420]   It's really difficult to decide, as you read the Bible,
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.420]   which is the more important factor,
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:16.420]   the arrogance of men or the folly of men.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.420]   I think it's still the folly because the arrogance arises out of the folly.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.420]   Men wouldn't be arrogant if he wasn't such a fool.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.420]   He's arrogant because he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.420]   He doesn't understand what he's saying.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.420]   So the ultimate cause of trouble is men's folly.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.420]   And you will notice in the Bible
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.420]   that this is the thing that it says most frequently of all about the sinner.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   What is a sinner?
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   Well, the Bible has got many ways of defining sin.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.420]   It says that sin is missing the mark.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.420]   It's like a man aiming at a target and missing it.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   All right, that's true.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.420]   It says that it is transgression.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   That it is disobedience. Perfectly true.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.420]   But the ultimate thing about the sinner, the man who disobeys God,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.420]   is that he is a fool.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.420]   The fool that said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.420]   You remember our Lord's parable about the rich fool.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.420]   The man who was congratulating himself.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.420]   He'd done so well.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   He'd done so well that his barns had become too small.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.420]   He's got to pull them down and build greater.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.420]   And he congratulates himself and says,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   "Oh, thou hast much good laid up for many years.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.420]   Take an ease, eat, drink, and be merry."
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   But God said unto him,
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.420]   Then whose shall these things be which thou hast collected?"
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   The fool.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   And this is, I say, the commonest charge
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   that is brought against men in sin.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   Men in rebellion against God in the Bible.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.420]   He's a fool.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   How does his folly show itself?
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   Well, the chief way and the greatest way
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.420]   in which it shows itself is this.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.420]   That men shows his folly in fooling himself.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   In self-deception.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.420]   This is the most tragic thing of all.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   It's bad enough when a man fools others.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.420]   But it is rarely tragic when he fools himself.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.420]   And that is what mankind has been doing, I say,
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   from the very beginning since it first rebelled
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.420]   and turned against God.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.420]   The original sin was the greatest act of folly
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   that's ever been committed.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   Listening to the suggestion of the devil against God.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   Believing that lie.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.420]   It was madness.
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.420]   That's folly.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420]   Very well.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.420]   Now then, I want to show you
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.420]   the essence of this self-deception.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   And it comes out very clearly here
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   in what Stephen says about the children of Israel.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   Here it is.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   Moses was with them and had led them out.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.420]   And now he's gone up onto the mount
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.420]   to receive the law from God.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   And he says, "To whom your fathers would not obey,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.420]   but trust him from them."
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   And in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   saying unto Moses, "Make us gods to go before us."
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   And they made a calf in those days
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   and offered sacrifice unto the idol
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.420]   and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   Now let me show it to you.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   Here is a perfect picture
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.420]   of this incredible folly of the human race.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   Never has it been more manifest than at this present moment.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   "Make us."
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   They worshipped the works of their own hands.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.420]   What's this?
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.420]   Well, Paul, as is not infrequently the case with him,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   has said the final word about all this
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.420]   in the 22nd verse of the first chapter
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   of his epistle to the Romans.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.420]   It is the most devastating thing
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.420]   that has ever been said about the human race,
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.420]   but it has never been seen more clearly
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.420]   than it is at this moment.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:07.420]   "Professing themselves to be warriors,
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.420]   they became fools."
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.420]   If that isn't the most perfect description
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.420]   that you've ever heard of men in this 20th century,
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.420]   well then, you know very little about life.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.420]   Here it is, "Professing themselves to be warriors,
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.420]   they became fools."
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   "Professing themselves to be warriors,"
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.420]   in what sense?
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   Well, in this sense,
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:40.420]   men's self-confidence is endless.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   There's nothing that men can't do.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   After all, men have split the atom.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   He's beaten the law of gravity.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   He sends a man up into outer space.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.420]   Is there anything that can stand before a man?
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   Of course there isn't.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.420]   Man's the center of the universe.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.420]   The greatest thing in the universe
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.420]   is the brain of man.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.420]   There is nothing that men cannot do.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   There is no limit to his capacity.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420]   What is it?
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   Well, he can do anything.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   What can he do?
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   What does he claim he can do?
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.420]   Well, the first thing that he makes is this.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.420]   He can make God.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.420]   Men can make God.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.420]   "They turned to Aaron and said,
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   'Make us gods to go before us.'
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   They made a calf in those days
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.420]   and offered sacrifice unto the idol
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.420]   and rejoiced in the works of their own hand."
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   There's nothing new, you see, about modern men.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   His forefathers did exactly the same thing.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.420]   Men believed in those days that he could make God.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.420]   He can make a god.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.420]   He wants a god, so he proceeds to make him.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.420]   He's got the capacity.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   He's quite sure of this.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.420]   He's quite confident of it.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.420]   So they, in this extraordinary way and manner,
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.420]   they made a god out of gold
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.420]   and then proceeded to worship him.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.420]   Now, they had no hesitation, of course,
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.420]   in doing this at all.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   Men has never had any hesitation about making gods.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.420]   He's got many gods.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.420]   You can have pantheons.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.420]   And they named them Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.420]   and all the rest of them.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   You see, in the olden times,
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.420]   it was quite clear that men was very confident
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.420]   that he could make gods.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   He still does the same.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.420]   And this, of course, has been the most evident
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.420]   and prominent activity of mankind
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   for the last hundred years or so.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   What's been happening in the last hundred years?
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.420]   Well, man in his cleverness has been constructing
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.420]   and making a new god.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.420]   It's called the higher criticism of the Bible.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   It started in Germany,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.420]   as many other of these things started in Germany,
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:56.420]   with a great belief in man, great man.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.420]   This idea that to believe in God was an insult to man.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.420]   So, you see, it worked itself out in terms of the Bible.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.420]   And they came and they sat in judgment upon the Bible.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.420]   And they said, "Of course, there are some things
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.420]   which are right in the Bible,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.420]   but there's a great deal of nonsense
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.420]   and of rubbish in the Bible."
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.420]   They said, "Now, if the Bible says this about God,
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.420]   it's wrong. Throw it out."
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   That's not true.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   Who decides what God is like?
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.420]   Men.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.420]   And that is what they've been doing for a century.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.420]   They've been constructing a god, a new god.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.420]   There's no wrath in God.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   There's no justice.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.420]   There's no righteousness.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.420]   God doesn't punish.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.420]   God is only love.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   Nothing else.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.420]   Now, they haven't hesitated to do this.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.420]   They have constructed a new father, a new son,
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.420]   a new Holy Ghost,
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.420]   if they believe in the Holy Ghost at all.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.420]   But the thing is that they haven't hesitated to say
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   that man can sit in judgment on this revelation
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.420]   and that man is competent to define and to describe
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.420]   and to delimit God.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.420]   And if God doesn't tally with my ideas,
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.420]   so much the worse for God.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:09.420]   It's man who decides, not God.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   I'm simply giving you facts.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   Perhaps you've been guilty of this, my friend.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.420]   Examine yourself.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.420]   Do you realize that you've been setting up
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.420]   your pygmy intellect as the final authority
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.420]   and that you haven't hesitated to deliver your opinions
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   on God and that God is wrong if he does this
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.420]   and why doesn't God do that?
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.420]   Haven't you said these things?
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.420]   That's judging God.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.420]   That's attempting to make a God for yourself.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.420]   Man's self-confidence makes him say that he is capable
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.420]   of making and creating a God.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.420]   What else?
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.420]   Well, of course, it follows from the first.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.420]   He has also been very confident that he knows
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.420]   the truth about himself, about men.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.420]   He doesn't like the biblical view of men.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.420]   That was the original temptation, wasn't it?
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.420]   Yea, has God said that you shouldn't do this?
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.420]   It's not right. It's not fair to men.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.420]   It's not just.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.420]   In other words, they set up their opinion of men
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.420]   against God's opinion of men.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.420]   They rejected God's, accepted the devil's, took it on.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.420]   And that is what you find so constantly in the pages
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.420]   of the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.420]   Man believes that he knows himself,
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.420]   that he understands himself.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.420]   And never has he been doing this again more assiduously
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.420]   than during this present century.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.420]   He doesn't accept the biblical view of men.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.420]   He regards it as insulting.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.420]   What's his view of men?
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.420]   Well, he's got many views.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.420]   Some of them regard him as a purely economic unit.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.420]   That men is nothing but the result of the interplay
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.420]   of capital and labor, dialectical materialism.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.420]   Call it what you like.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.420]   Others have got this biological view of men.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   Others have got the supposed scientific view of men.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   Others have got what they call a psychological view of men.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.420]   But you see, in each case, they think that they can define men.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.420]   They understand men.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.420]   And they can tell you exactly what men is like.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.420]   They reject everything else.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.420]   This, they say, is man.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.420]   And this is how man is to live.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.420]   I'll tell you in a moment how he does live.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:22.420]   But they claim the competence to decide what man is
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.420]   and what man is meant to be like.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.420]   And that leads, of course, to the third thing, which is this.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:33.420]   That they're quite confident that they know how life is to be lived in this world
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:39.420]   and how this world is to be run and how it is to be ordered.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.420]   That's what the children of Israel kept on doing.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.420]   They turned their backs on God.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.420]   They said, "No, then we're going to do it."
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   That's how they first asked for a king.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.420]   You know, they were never meant to have a king.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.420]   But they said, "Other nations have got kings.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.420]   Why don't we have a king?
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.420]   This isn't fair to us.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.420]   Let's have a king."
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.420]   They were God's people.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.420]   They were a theocracy.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   No, no, they were not content with that.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.420]   They wanted to be a kingdom like other kingdoms.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.420]   They always think they know better than God.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.420]   So they pleaded for a king.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   And God said, "All right, I'll give you a king.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.420]   But this is what will happen to you if you have one."
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.420]   And it did happen to them.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.420]   But this is it.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.420]   That was their whole story.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:18.420]   And it is still the story.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:22.420]   Man thinks he knows how to live, how to run his world.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   Oh, the confidence of mankind in philosophy and politics
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   during the last hundred years.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.420]   People believed that by acts of parliament
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.420]   you could make a perfect world, that you could banish war.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.420]   They really believed it.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.420]   They were not dishonest.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:46.420]   They believed it such was the folly of this delusion of grandeur,
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.420]   this megalomania.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.420]   Man really believed that he could make the world perfect
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:57.420]   by politics and education, sociology, philosophy, science,
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.420]   and all these things.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.420]   He believed he could make a perfect world.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.420]   He still believes it.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.420]   That's the astounding thing, isn't it?
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.420]   Well, now, here I say is the first great manifestation
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.420]   of this incredible folly of mankind.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.420]   Make us gods!
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.420]   Worship the work of their own hands, themselves,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.420]   the way in which to live.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   Now, I'm simply pointing this out to you for this reason.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.420]   Stephen says it's the only explanation
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.420]   of why the Sanhedrin rejects the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.420]   and his salvation.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.420]   And it's still true.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:39.420]   Why do people reject the revelation of the Bible?
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   Why is the world so slow to believe this?
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.420]   Because, you see, this book is being verified every day.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.420]   The world is proving the truth of this.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.420]   Everything else has been falsified.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.420]   This is being proved to be true.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.420]   You see, it wasn't the Bible which said at the end of the last century
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.420]   that the 20th century was going to be the greatest century of all times.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.420]   It wasn't the Bible that said that.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.420]   The Bible said the exact opposite, as I've shown you.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.420]   It was the people who deny the Bible who said that.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.420]   They've been the false optimists.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.420]   There is no false optimism in the Bible.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   But why do people resent this revelation,
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.420]   this teaching that comes to us?
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.420]   There's only one answer.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.420]   Man feels that revelation is an insult to him.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   It's an insult.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.420]   You see, he believes he's got this capacity.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.420]   Why?
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.420]   He's a research worker and he has been able to split the atom.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.420]   Well, surely there's nothing he can't do.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.420]   Man doesn't need to be treated like a child.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.420]   He's got the capacity and the power.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.420]   If he only uses it, if he only sets out on the great research,
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   the great endeavor, he must arrive at ultimate truth, absolute reality.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.420]   And he believed he could get there.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.420]   He still believes it.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.420]   And so, when he confronts this gospel,
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.420]   which tells him in the words of our Lord,
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.420]   "Except he be converted and become as little children,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.420]   he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God,"
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   he feels it's an insult to him.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.420]   He's such a fool.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.420]   He's such a megalomaniac.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.420]   He's so deluded himself about himself.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.420]   But when God addresses him,
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.420]   he rejects it and regards it as an insult.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.420]   Very well, there is the first great element in this folly,
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   as it is analyzed here by Stephen.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.420]   He says, "Don't you see you're doing the very thing your forefathers did?
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.420]   The very selfsame thing.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.420]   Don't you see it?"
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:41.420]   And I'm attempting feebly to say the same thing to you tonight, my dear friend.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.420]   Have you still got this fatal trust in your own capacity,
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   in your own understanding?
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   Do you understand the world?
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.420]   Do you understand yourself?
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.420]   What do you really know about God?
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.420]   Face it.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.420]   But wait a minute.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.420]   There is the contention
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.420]   that man's essential trouble is his folly,
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.420]   and especially the folly of self-deception
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:18.420]   in terms of his illimitable confidence in his own power and capacity.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:23.420]   But secondly, let me prove to you that man is a fool.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.420]   The Bible doesn't stop at assertion.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.420]   The Bible goes on to give us demonstration.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:38.420]   I know of nothing more devastating than the way in which Stephen does it here.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.420]   I say I know of nothing more devastating.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.420]   I mean by that in a kind of literary sense.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   I see it awfully devastating in the world around and about me at this present moment.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.420]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.420]   This is the amazing thing.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.420]   Of course, it is a part of self-deception.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   Man doesn't realize it.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   See that poor fellow under the influence of drink.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.420]   He's ready to take on anybody in a fight.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.420]   He's ready to enter into any competition.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   There's nothing he can't do.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.420]   What's the matter with him? Well, he's drunk.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   His self-confidence is based on the fact that he's drunk.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.420]   He doesn't see it.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.420]   And the world is like that at the present time.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   It doesn't see its folly.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   In spite of what is happening, it can't see it
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.420]   because of this condition from which it's suffering.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.420]   This, you see, is the whole difficulty.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:34.420]   This is why the world doesn't see the essence of its difficulties and its problems
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.420]   even at this present moment.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   But would you like to see the folly of mankind
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.420]   demonstrated, proved
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   beyond the possibility of contradiction?
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.420]   Let me show it to you.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   Man shows that he's a fool
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.420]   when you look at what he produces
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.420]   in contradistinction to what he rejects.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:05.420]   And that's the thing, of course, that Stephen brings out at this point
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.420]   by quoting from the 32nd chapter of the book of Exodus
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.420]   which we have read at the beginning.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:19.420]   Are you in any doubt still as to whether man is a fool as he is by nature?
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.420]   Well, let me show it to you.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.420]   Man rejects, he makes.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   What does he reject? God.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:38.420]   What does he make? A calf.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.420]   Could anything be plainer?
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:46.420]   He rejects God.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:51.420]   "To whom our fathers would not obey, that thrusting from them and in their hearts
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.420]   turned back again unto Egypt, saying unto Aaron,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   Make us gods to go before us.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   For as this Moses which brought us out to the land of Egypt,
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.420]   we want not what is become of it."
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.420]   And they made, they're going to make a god now.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.420]   They're rejecting God, what are they going to make?
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   They made a calf in those days.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:17.420]   Offered sacrifices unto the idol.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.420]   My dear friend, what can be said?
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.420]   That's mankind at this very moment.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   You remember how the apostle Paul puts this
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.420]   in the second half of his first chapter of the epistle to the Romans?
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.420]   They said, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.420]   for God has showed it unto them.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.420]   being understood by the things that are made,
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.420]   even his eternal power and Godhead,
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.420]   so that they are without excuse.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:53.420]   Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.420]   neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations,
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.420]   and their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.420]   Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.420]   into an image made like to corruptible men,
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:16.420]   and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things."
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.420]   That's what they've done.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:24.420]   And that is what they're still doing.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.420]   They reject God.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.420]   God the creator, God the sustainer of the whole universe,
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.420]   God the order of all things,
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.420]   the God of providence, the God of history,
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.420]   the holy God, the glorious God.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.420]   Oh, I'll tell you about the God that they rejected.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   He's given a description of himself.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.420]   He gave it to Moses soon after the incident
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.420]   that we read about at the beginning.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.420]   "And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.420]   and proclaimed the name of the Lord.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.420]   And the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed," listen,
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.420]   "the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:14.420]   long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth,
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.420]   keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.420]   and transgression and sin, and that will by no means
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.420]   clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.420]   upon the children and upon the children's children,
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.420]   and unto the third and fourth generation."
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:36.420]   That's God, the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:42.420]   Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.420]   in light inaccessible, hid from our eyes,
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   most blessed, most glorious, the ancient of days,
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.420]   pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.420]   God dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.420]   No man hath seen him or ever can see him,
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.420]   the everlasting God, the God of glory.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   A dazzling description.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   And yet, a God to whom we can pray,
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   a God who is ready to listen to us,
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:20.420]   the living God, the powerful God, the active God,
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.420]   That's the God from whom man turns away.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.420]   And what has he done?
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.420]   What does he make?
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.420]   What is the God that he creates?
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.420]   A calf.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:44.420]   Have you noticed he always does something like this?
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.420]   Makes a calf.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.420]   Of course, he makes it of gold.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.420]   And this is where he shows his folly still further.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.420]   He thinks that if he makes a calf of gold,
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.420]   it's going to be something different from if it was a calf made of wood.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.420]   He doesn't see that in all cases it's still a calf.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.420]   But because it's gold, it looks marvelous, and it's costly.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.420]   And he thinks this is it.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.420]   A calf made of gold.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.420]   And he worships it.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.420]   And he bows down before it.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:18.420]   And he doesn't stop with calves, creeping things.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.420]   And men and so on.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.420]   Well, what does it come to?
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.420]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.420]   This is what mankind is still doing.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.420]   The people of this country, over 90% of them are much too intelligent, they tell us,
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.420]   to believe in God any longer.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.420]   What do they believe in?
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.420]   They believe in the British lion.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.420]   He's had his tail twisted a bit, hasn't he, recently?
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   But a lion, you see, it's always an animal.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.420]   The Russian bear.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.420]   The German eagle.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.420]   It's always the same.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.420]   And we give ourselves away.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   What a lot of fools we are.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.420]   We don't believe in God.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.420]   What do we believe in?
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.420]   Well, we believe in our country.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   There are many people who worship their country.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.420]   That's a part of the cause of what happened last week, you know.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   Nationalism.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.420]   Nationalism is ultimately worship of country.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   Worshipping of the blood that's in you.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.420]   Worshipping yourself writ large.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.420]   Worshipping country.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.420]   These are the gods.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.420]   Gold, money, look at the worship of money.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.420]   Oh, we're much too intelligent to believe in God.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   So we go in for football goals.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.420]   Money.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   Food, drink, travel, pleasure, money.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.420]   Money's the god.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.420]   Now, you see, people say, "We can't possibly believe in God.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.420]   It's insulting to us."
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.420]   But they're literally worshipping money.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   I've known people who worshipped Hanses.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.420]   There's no question about it.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.420]   They've worshipped motor cars.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.420]   I've known many people who worshipped their own children.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:00.420]   They've sacrificed God without a moment's thought for the sake of their children.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:07.420]   They'll discourage their children to be religious in order that they may get on in the world.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.420]   But as Paul reminds us, man has been worshipping himself.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.420]   Man.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.420]   Not only four-footed beasts and creeping things, but man himself.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.420]   And this is the god of this 20th century.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.420]   Man, great man, scientific man.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.420]   Come of age, he's worshipping himself.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   What is he but a fool, a car, an animal.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   He turns from God and worships a beast.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   Well, there is one proof and manifestation of it, but look at a second.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:51.420]   Men turns from law to license.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   They turn from the law of God.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.420]   The law that they've got in their hearts.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.420]   The law that had been given to them in the Ten Commandments.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.420]   The moral law.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   All the teaching.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   They turn from that.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.420]   And they adopted their own way.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.420]   You remember the description.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.420]   You know the Ten Commandments.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.420]   You read them.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.420]   What a body of doctrine.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   What a body of law.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.420]   The worship of God.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.420]   The keeping of God's day.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.420]   You know, it's a good thing to have day of rest.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.420]   One in seven, apart from anything else.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   All the wisdom of the Ten Commandments.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   And then you come to the second table.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   Thou shalt not kill.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.420]   Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.420]   Thou shalt not bear false witness.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   And so on.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.420]   What a noble law.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.420]   I've often said it from this pulpit.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:49.420]   If the whole world tonight were only observing the Ten Commandments,
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.420]   you wouldn't have had the tragedy of the last week.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.420]   Most of our problems would be solved.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.420]   Add to that our Lord's interpretation of it in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:06.420]   If the whole world tonight were only living according to the moral, ethical teaching of the Bible,
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.420]   you wouldn't have your wars.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.420]   You wouldn't have divorce.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.420]   You wouldn't have violence.
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.420]   You wouldn't have crime.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.420]   You wouldn't have drug taking.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.420]   You wouldn't have any of these things.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   What a noble law it is.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.420]   What a pattern for living.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.420]   But man in his cleverness turns from that.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   What to?
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.420]   Drinking.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   Dancing.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.420]   That's what they were doing at the foot of the Mount when Moses came down.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   They were naked and they were drinking and they were dancing.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:43.420]   And that is what the world is still doing in spite of its problems and its tragedies.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:53.420]   Drinking, drugs, dancing, sex, metal, confusion, promiscuity, diseases, confusion, rampant.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   That's what man produces.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:02.420]   When man turns from God's holy law, that is what he always produces.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.420]   Invariably.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   Well, let me put it to you in a third form.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.420]   I'm exposing this following.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   Man invariably turns from a condition in which he has been delivered and set free and given joy to slavery and to fear.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.420]   This is what always happens when man turns from God.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.420]   These people you see are so forgetful.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   What liars we are by nature.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:41.420]   Listen to these children of Israel. They make this calf out of gold for themselves and they say,
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.420]   "These be the gods which have delivered us out of Egypt."
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.420]   It was a bare-faced lie.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.420]   And they knew it, yet they said it.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   They gave the credit to the golden calf for having delivered them out of the bondage and the captivity of Egypt.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.420]   It's an open, bare-faced lie.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   It was God who delivered them.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.420]   How soon we forget.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:12.420]   They'd forgotten the slavery and the misery and the taskmasters and the lashes of the whips and their utter, complete impotence.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:16.420]   It was God and God alone who delivered them.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.420]   He sent his servant, Moses. He gave him miraculous powers.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   Read the story for yourself in the early chapters of the book of Exodus.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.420]   It was God and God alone who brought them out.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   He opened the Red Sea before them.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   He led them through the wilderness.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.420]   He fed them with manna.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   He gave them water from rocks.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   It's all the action of God.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:46.420]   And that's only a picture and adumbration of the yet greater, bigger, and more glorious thing
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   that God has done in Jesus Christ, his Son, and the salvation that he sent him into the world to give to us.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   This is a salvation. This is a deliverance.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:02.420]   God, at the cost of the death of his own Son, has made it possible for you and for me to be forgiven.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   To be set free from the bondage and the captivity of sin.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:13.420]   To become the sons of God and the heirs of eternal and everlasting bliss.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.420]   That is what men reject.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.420]   What does he turn to?
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:24.420]   Well, it's so obvious in this ancient story. Stephen summarizes it here.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.420]   You see, they turned their backs on God.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.420]   What did they turn to?
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   Well, they not only make calves, they not only make idols and bow down before them, as men are still doing.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   Did you notice this other thing?
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:41.420]   Yea, he took up the tabernacle of Morroc and the star of your God, Remph, and figures which he made to worship them.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.420]   God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.420]   What does this mean?
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.420]   Well, this is what it does mean.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   Having turned their backs on God, they began to worship the stars, and the moon, and the sun.
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.420]   In other words, they took up astrology.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   They went in for spiritism.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   Why did they do this?
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   Well, it's quite simple. They're still doing it, you see.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:13.420]   The modern man is much too intelligent to believe in God, but he believes in astrology.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   He believes in spiritism.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:17.420]   What's the matter?
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   Oh, the matter is this, you see, that when you turn from God, you turn from deliverance and liberty and joy,
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:30.420]   to bondage, to serfdom, to slavery, to the fear of life and the fear of death.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   And you don't know where you are. You don't understand life.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.420]   So you consult the stars, and you read the experts of the stars.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.420]   You look at the paper every day.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   What's going to happen to me today?
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.420]   This is sheer slavery.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.420]   This is tragedy.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:54.420]   Mankind worshipping stars, faith, looking to the occult, spiritism, all these things.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.420]   Man has never been so afraid of life and so helpless in life as he is at the present time.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.420]   He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know what to do.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.420]   Why?
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.420]   Well, you see, you can't pray to a calf.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.420]   You can't pray to a lion.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.420]   You can't pray to men.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   He can't help you.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:19.420]   Your idols are silent. They're helpless.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   The psalmists ridicule them.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.420]   Look at your idols. Look at your God, says the psalmist.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.420]   They've got eyes, but they can't see.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.420]   You've given them eyes, but they can't see with them.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.420]   You've given them hands, but they can't do anything with them.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.420]   You've given them feet, but they can't move.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.420]   You've created a God, but you have to move him about.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.420]   He can't move. He's helpless.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:45.420]   And the result is, you see, that in your agony, in your trouble, in your moment of greatest need,
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.420]   when you need help from outside yourself, there's nobody there.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.420]   There's nobody to pray to.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.420]   The idol doesn't hear. He's deaf.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.420]   He can't speak. He's dumb.
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.420]   He can't give you a word of comfort or consolation.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.420]   He can't tell you what to do.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.420]   He's completely silent, and he leaves you to yourself.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:05.420]   That is what man does when he turns from God.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:10.420]   And the result is, you see, he has to go in for astrology and spiritism.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:13.420]   He'll clutch at anything, anything to give him help.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.420]   He doesn't know his mosque. He's in a wilderness.
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   He's frightened by what's happening.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.420]   He has no idea what's coming to him, but he's already terrified.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.420]   What's going to happen?
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.420]   He doesn't know how to live. He doesn't know how to die.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.420]   He doesn't know what lies beyond death.
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.420]   He's fumbling, stumbling in the dark, trying to find a bit of knowledge.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:38.420]   It's all because he has rejected the word, the revelation, the law of God.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.420]   But finally, the ultimate folly of men is seen in this.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.420]   Listen to this.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:51.420]   "Then they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol,"
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:54:03.420]   Listen to this. "and rejoiced," rejoiced, "in the works of their own hands."
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.420]   "When Moses and Joshua were coming down from that mount, they heard a noise,
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.420]   and Joshua, in his ignorance, said, 'This is the noise of war.'
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.420]   'No, no,' said Moses, 'it isn't. It's the noise of singing.'"
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.420]   Can you imagine this of an intelligent people?
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:22.420]   Especially of a people who'd just been delivered from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt,
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   and had seen the marvel and the miracle of the dividing of the Red Sea, and other things.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.420]   Can you believe it of them?
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.420]   That having made a God for themselves, a golden calf,
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:38.420]   they were rejoicing, they were dancing, they were singing,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.420]   they were making merry, they were drinking,
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.420]   they were having a marvelous time.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.420]   They thought they'd done something glorious.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.420]   They dismissed this fellow Moses, "We want not what has become of him."
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.420]   They'd made a great advance.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:57.420]   They've dismissed the servant of God, and they've dismissed God.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:01.420]   And they were very happy in congratulating themselves.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   They said, "This is advance."
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.420]   They were bursting, they were rejoicing, they were happy.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   And that's your modern world.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.420]   This modern world.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:19.420]   That glory is in the fact that man was not made in the image of God,
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:23.420]   but that he has evolved from some primitive slime,
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   and is just a highly developed and advanced ape.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.420]   They're glorying in it.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   They think it's marvelous.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.420]   It is marvelous to deny God,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   and to worship man as some creature, some idol.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   It is marvelous to think that I'm not made upright and righteous in the image of God,
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.420]   but that I'm just an intelligent animal.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:52.420]   They're glorying in it, and they're pouring ridicule upon the Son of God and his glorious gospel.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:56.420]   There's only one thing to say about people who do that.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.420]   They're mad.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.420]   They're unutterable fools.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   They're drunk.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.420]   They're drugged.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   They're not awake, they can't think, they don't see.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   Their world isn't open to them.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   In the name of God, I plead with you, awaken.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   Let the facts of the last week speak to you.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   Let history speak to you.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.420]   Let this summary of the history of the children of Israel speak to you.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   Awake to righteousness.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:34.420]   Be sober.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:40.420]   And the moment you become sober, you will say in the words of Hosea,
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:44.420]   "What have I to do with idols?
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.420]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:53.420]   Have I been bound down to a graven image, to an idol, to a cast, to an animal?
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.420]   It's incredible.
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   What have I to do with idols?"
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:02.420]   Or if you prefer it in the words of the prodigal son,
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:09.420]   when eventually he came to himself in the far country and said in effect,
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   "What am I doing here and in this condition?
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.420]   What a fool I've been.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.420]   How many servants, paid servants, are there in my father's house and home
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.420]   who are in a better condition than this?
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.420]   I'm mad.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:25.420]   I'm a fool."
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   I will arise and go to my father.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   But if you are conscious tonight that you are in a far country,
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:40.420]   away from God, surrounded by swine and animals and four-footed beasts
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   and eating the husks on which swine feed,
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.420]   if you realize that you're there and that you're a fool to be there,
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.420]   that you were made for God and meant for communion with him,
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:54.420]   I say to you, arise!
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.420]   Go home.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.420]   Go back to your father.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.420]   And blessed be his holy name.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:06.420]   If you do that, you'll find that he's waiting for you.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.420]   He'll come to meet you and he'll embrace you.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   He'll say, "Son, daughter, thy sins are forgiven thee.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.420]   I've already punished them in the person of mine only begotten dearly beloved son.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.420]   Come, enter in.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   Let us rejoice and be made merry.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:31.420]   My dear friend, I repeat on it, arise and go to your father."
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.420]   Amen.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
