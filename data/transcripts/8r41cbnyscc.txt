[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Thursday. We're going deep today.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I mentioned Monday that I have a batch of related questions to offer you,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Pastor John, all big, all touch on several points of theology,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   all of them similar and all accumulated over the years from reading audience emails.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I think they're the kinds of questions that all of us will face at some point
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   as we read our Bibles and as we develop an appropriate
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   God-centered vision of the universe.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   So as a first foray on this podcast
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   into this matrix of questions, I'll put them all on the table for you,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Pastor John, in brief. Our God-centeredness here at Desiring God raises
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   questions about the integrity of creation,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   us in particular, us humans. So here are those questions.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Are we as creatures simply a
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   means to God's own self-glorification?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Do we exist for a purpose beyond God's own
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   self-glory? And does God love us beyond His love
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   for Himself or is the first fully subsumed by the second?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Are we as image-bearers simply mirror
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   holders for Him to see Himself in us? Do
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   we count? Does God love or delight in His creatures
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   for what they are in themselves?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Speaking of unbelievers, does God delight in materially
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   blessing creatures that do not or will not believe in Him?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But speaking of believers specifically, does God love to
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   love us simply because it blesses us? Is such
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   a category even operable? How would you tackle a matrix
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   of questions like these? What might be helpful is
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   to clarify what it is that gives rise
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   to these kinds of questions and then maybe give
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   very brief, maybe one-sentence answers
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   to each of those, I think there are nine of those questions
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and then step back and look at the Bible and see
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   what it is about God and what it is about His ways that make those very
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   brief answers justifiable, compelling, maybe
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   explain why they make sense. So, what gives rise to these
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   questions is that I and many others
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   in the history of the Church have emphasized
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   the biblical teaching that God created
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and redeemed His people for His
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   own glory. Meaning,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   to cause His glory, that is His greatness, His
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   beauty, His worth to be known
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and treasured and shown in the universe.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   That's what I think glorify, for His own glory
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   means. Isaiah 43, 7, "My sons and my daughters
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   whom I created for my glory." Ephesians
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   1, 4 to 7, "We're chosen, predestined,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   adopted, redeemed through the blood of Christ for the praise
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   of the glory of God's grace."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And that teaching, namely that all
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   things are from Him and through Him and to Him, to His
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   glory, all things, causes all
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   these questions to be raised. So, let me respond
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   to each of these nine questions with a very short answer
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and then look at the main thing in Scripture.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Number one, are we simply a means
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   to God's self-glorification? No.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Not simply because stars and stones and mountains
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   are means to God's self-glorification
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   but not the way humans are. It's not that simple. Number two,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   do we exist for a purpose beyond
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   God's own self-glory? No.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   There is no such thing as beyond God's glory.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Three, does God love us beyond
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   His love for Himself or is the
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   first fully subsumed in the second?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   God has no greater
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   love than the love He has for His Son
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   who is the radiance of His glory
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   and the exact imprint of His nature and is therefore
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   a love for His own infinitely glorious
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   self. To love us with that
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   same love cannot be improved upon.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Number four, are we as image
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   bearers simply mirror holders
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   for Him to see Himself? No.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   He didn't need us in order to simply see Himself.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   He has done that with infinite joy in the fellowship of the Trinity
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   from all eternity. Number five, do we
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   count? Yes. He did not need to
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   create and He did not create for nothing. Six,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   does God love or delight in His
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   creatures for what they are in themselves?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   What humans are
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   in themselves, apart from
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   our reliance on God and our rejoicing in God, is
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   what hell is for. It is not wise
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   to want to be loved the way a human in hell
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   might be loved. Number seven,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   does God delight in materially blessing creatures
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   that will never believe in Him? Yes.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   God delights in the overflow of mercy even where it is spurned.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Eight, speaking of believers,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   does God love to love us simply because
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   it blesses us? God's
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   blessing us is never simply
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   for us without also being for Him
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   because there is no eternal blessing where our
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   good does not include God.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Nine, is that category even operable?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Namely, the category of God's loving us
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   simply because it blesses us. No.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It is atheistic to think it would be
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   good for God to bless us in a way that did not glorify
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   His grace by our enjoyment of it.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Now, let me see if I can put some
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   biblical truth underneath those short answers.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   First, we need to take really seriously
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   the fact that there is a powerful
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   atheistic tendency in every human heart.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That's what it means to be fallen and
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   depraved and sinful by nature. Romans 1.18
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   "Humans by their unrighteousness suppress
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   the truth," Paul said. What truth do we suppress?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Verse 28, "They did not approve
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   of having God in their knowledge."
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Or verse 22, "They exchanged
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   the glory of the immortal God for images."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Or Romans 8.7, "The mind of the flesh is
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   hostile to God." In other words,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the Bible teaches that human beings by nature
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   are going to be powerfully resistant
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   to any doctrine that emphasizes
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   the absolute supremacy of God in all things and that makes
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   God the ultimate good of all that is good.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Then the second thing to notice from the Bible
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   is that over and over and over
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   again, God himself and all that
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   he is for us in Jesus is shown to be
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   the ultimate good, the ultimate fulfillment,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   happiness, satisfaction, joy
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   of the redeemed human heart. If you
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   trace God's love from its origin in the
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   eternal grace of God through his redeeming work
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   in Christ to the ultimate and greatest,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   most beautiful, most satisfying end,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   that end is always God. God
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   himself enjoyed supremely in the heart
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   of the redeemed. So in John 17.24
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Jesus prays for us that we would see his glory.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That is ultimate final wish of love
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   for us, that we would see his glory and that we would
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   be able to love him with the very love that the Father has for him.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   1 Peter 3.18, Peter says that Christ suffered
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   for us that he might
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   bring us to God.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Where according to Psalm 16.11 we find fullness of joy
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   and pleasures forevermore. That's what God
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   will be for the redeemed. Now what this boils down
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   to is this. It never makes sense to speak
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   of God delighting in doing us
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   good and God delighting in his own glory as
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   though our ultimate good could be distinct from
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   the glory of God. Never makes sense to talk like that. It can't be
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   because our ultimate good always
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   consists in knowing and treasuring and showing
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   God's glory. The resistance to this
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   wonderful truth that God's glory shines
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   in me by my happily exalting
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   in him. The resistance to this truth
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   as if there could be some greater happiness.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   If I could just be me, be me, distinct from reliance on
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   God, distinct from rejoicing in God, distinct from glorifying God. If I could just
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   be me. That resistance is evil.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   It is a remnant of the atheistic
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   nature we were born with and we need
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   to ask God to take it away.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   A remnant of the atheistic nature. That is pointed.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for getting us into this massive and massively
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   important discussion. It touches on so many things and carries
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   eternal implications for every one of us
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   to the point that it feels like maybe this episode is the first episode that will generate
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   some thoughtful follow-up questions in the future. And if you have a follow-up
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   question, mention this episode, APJ 1980,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   send me an email and send me your follow-up question. Our address is
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's an email address.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. I'm very interested to see
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   what follow-ups this episode generates.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Well, why don't we have more artifacts, more
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   archaeology, or even a more diversified record
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   of historical documents to corroborate the death
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and resurrection of Jesus Christ? Shouldn't we have more?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It's a question we get from time to time and it's up next,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   next week. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. See you Monday.
