[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   I know many people are curious as to whether or not
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.640]   caffeine can improve focus and concentration.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.640]   And indeed it can.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.880]   There is an immense amount of data supporting the idea
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.640]   that caffeine provided it's consumed
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.060]   in the appropriate dosages can improve mental performance
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.040]   and physical performance.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.840]   And it largely does that through improvements
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.040]   in focus and concentration.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.480]   The dosage of caffeine, of course,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.200]   is going to depend on how caffeine adapted you are,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.400]   how much caffeine tolerance you have.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.360]   And that is going to vary tremendously
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.840]   depending on whether or not you ingest that caffeine
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.320]   with or without food, as I mentioned earlier.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.520]   But there is a kind of general range
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520]   in which we can talk about caffeine
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760]   as being useful for focus and concentration.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   And the range is basically from 100 milligrams
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.240]   to 400 milligrams.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.000]   I want to caution everybody out there.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.400]   If you're somebody who suffers from anxiety
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.320]   or panic attacks, and you're not used to ingesting caffeine
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.000]   and you run out and ingest 400 milligrams of caffeine
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.880]   in the form of espresso or yerba mate
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.280]   or an energy drink or in pill form,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.320]   that is going to be very uncomfortable for you.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   You're going to be sweating profusely.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.040]   Your heart rate is going to increase.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000]   You're going to be quite panicked in fact,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.360]   or at least anxious.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.140]   So be cautious with your use and adopting of caffeine
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.380]   if you're not already caffeine adapted.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.440]   But most people do quite well to ingest 100 to 200 milligrams
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520]   of caffeine prior to doing some focused work.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240]   And again, I recommend delaying your caffeine intake
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.400]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.240]   unless you're using that caffeine
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080]   to really jolt your system before a workout.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   Caffeine can of course be ingested in various forms,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800]   even pill form, but most people ingest it
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.580]   in the form of coffee or my particular favorite way
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.780]   to ingest caffeine is yerba mate.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.960]   It is important and I should note
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.320]   that you should actively avoid the smoked versions
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.840]   of yerba mate as they contain a lot
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.280]   of carcinogenic cancer-promoting compounds.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.640]   There's some great yerba mate brands out there.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.600]   The most cost-effective way to consume it would be
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.880]   to use the loose leaf tea and to pour water over that.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.560]   There's one particular brand that I like.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.000]   I don't have any affiliation to them whatsoever,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.040]   but I've been using it for years.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.920]   It's Anna Park.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.080]   It's an organic brand that is sold.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.360]   I buy mine on Amazon,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.280]   but you can find it elsewhere on the internet as well.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.900]   Again, I don't have any affiliation to them.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.620]   It's just very cost-effective, very clean.
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.460]   It doesn't have the smoked flavor,
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.400]   at least the one that I buy is not the smoked variety.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.760]   So none of the carcinogenic compounds are in there,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.220]   at least that I'm aware of.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.080]   And I like the way it tastes
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.880]   and it provides a very even lift and stimulant
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.560]   that I think certainly works for me
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   and that a number of people I know
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.360]   that have suggested to also enjoy.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.240]   Yerba mate or caffeine also have other additional benefits.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.920]   In particular, the caffeine in yerba mate and coffee
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.440]   and other sources of caffeine are known
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.200]   to increase the density and efficacy
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.620]   that is the number and the function of dopamine receptors.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.240]   And this has been shown in humans several times.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.200]   So by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.520]   you're actually increasing the ability of dopamine
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.820]   to have this effect of increasing motivation and drive.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.320]   I tend to ingest caffeine only early in the day.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.880]   I tend to cut off my caffeine intake
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.560]   somewhere around one or 2 p.m.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.740]   to ensure that I can get into a good night's sleep.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.120]   But I realize that there are people out there
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.200]   that ingest caffeine as late as two or three
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.240]   in the afternoon and can still sleep fine.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.480]   I will caution those of you
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.840]   that think that you can drink caffeine
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.560]   in the evening or nighttime and still fall asleep.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.460]   All of the research points to the fact
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.900]   that the architecture of your sleep
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.520]   and the depth of your sleep is disrupted.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.240]   Even if you're able to fall and stay asleep,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.900]   the sleep you're getting is simply not as good
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.780]   as the sleep you would get
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.480]   if you were to shut off your caffeine intake
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   at least eight hours before bedtime
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.840]   and ideally more like 10 or even 12 hours before bedtime.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   But of course there are practical constraints as well.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.920]   Okay, so caffeine is increasing dopamine's function
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.160]   by changing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.040]   But of course it also increases our wakefulness,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.000]   our alertness.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   And that is largely through the neurochemical systems
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.440]   related to adenosine,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.580]   which is a molecule that builds up in our brain and body
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.600]   the longer we are awake.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.460]   It's part of the sleepiness system, if you will.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.680]   Makes us feel fatigued or tired.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.040]   And caffeine also operates on the epinephrine,
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.360]   the adrenaline system.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.960]   In fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.720]   we'll sometimes get the jitters.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.780]   Those jitters are really the sympathetic,
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.640]   as it's called, nervous system's bias toward movement.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   And our pupils will dilate.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.380]   They actually get broader.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.760]   Now, somewhat paradoxically, when our pupils get bigger,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.880]   the pupils of our eyes that is,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   our visual world actually narrows.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.240]   It becomes more tunnel-like.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.180]   A lot of people don't realize this.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.600]   When our pupils are really small, that means we are relaxed.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.120]   So if you ever see someone with really tiny
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.720]   or pin-sized pupils, they're very relaxed.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.200]   If their pupils are very big, they're very dilated,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.920]   well, then they are very amped up.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.000]   They are very, very alert.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.320]   Caffeine increases alertness by increasing epinephrine,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.960]   adrenaline release, both in the brain and within the body.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.080]   And so that's another way that it facilitates
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.880]   focus and concentration.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.880]   (upbeat music)
