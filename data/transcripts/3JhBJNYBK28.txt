[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - We get so many questions from listeners
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.060]   who want to escape sinful addictions to lust and pornography.
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.600]   We have so many listeners who want to be done
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.680]   with the sin of anger,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.760]   and many listeners want to know the key
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.040]   to personal holiness.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.360]   Pastor John, at the end of the day,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920]   we depend on God for all of this freedom.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.120]   I mean, God must free us.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.280]   So Pastor John, in this episode,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.620]   would you lead us in prayer before God right now
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.040]   on behalf of all of us,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.760]   that everyone listening will have hearts
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.640]   filled with satisfaction in God
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.840]   that is more powerful than the lure of the sins in our life?
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.160]   - I would love to, Tony, but let me, before I pray,
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.280]   let me just say a word to orient the listeners,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.960]   because I feel like they need a moment right here
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   just to prepare themselves for this,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.320]   because if they're gonna listen and say amen,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.280]   they need to have a heart of a sense of expectation,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700]   so they're not just listening to me pray like,
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.500]   oh, here's another podcast and piece of information,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.520]   what will he say, but really pray with me.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.500]   And I'm thinking of people here now,
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.180]   this is what I understand you mean,
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.420]   who are stuck in a same pattern of sin
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.020]   over and over with little movement.
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.260]   I remember one man's testimony of praying for freedom
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260]   from pornography for years,
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.700]   and then it came, and stunningly,
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.200]   he said, why would God answer the thousandth prayer
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.660]   and not the second one, or the 802nd one?
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.780]   And he didn't know the answer.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.620]   And I don't know the answer fully either,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.540]   except to say, perhaps the bowl of prayer
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.420]   in the presence of God was not full yet,
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.600]   and therefore the outpouring that he intended
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.860]   by all those accumulated prayers was not yet complete.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.820]   There are mysteries in this, and in other words,
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.260]   this prayer that I'm about to pray
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.260]   might be the 1000th prayer that fills the bowl.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.820]   Nothing unique about the prayer,
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.940]   just happens to be the last one in the bowl.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.920]   And then God pours it out on the people that are listening,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.300]   that would be my heart's desire.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.940]   But I want people to have hope and belief
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.340]   that this prayer and their prayers have not been in vain.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.860]   None of them have been in vain,
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.100]   'cause this kind of intransigent sin
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.420]   makes us feel like God's not listening,
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.100]   prayer is invalid, maybe the whole thing is not real.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.820]   Those are the horrible temptations
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.660]   that come with sin not going away.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.100]   God answers prayers in two sorts of ways.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.580]   One with dramatic overnight deliverances,
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.740]   and he answers prayers by putting in place
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.380]   series of events and influences
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.500]   which culminate into change, slowly or suddenly.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.540]   In fact, as I read the Bible,
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.340]   that process of sanctification is normal,
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.780]   else I don't see why Paul would write
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.620]   the second half of his letters
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.860]   if he could just pray and they could pray,
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.820]   boom, overnight, now we solve all these
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.100]   sanctification problems in our churches.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.060]   So let's pray.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.380]   Father, you have heard our heart's desire for this prayer,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.420]   and I wanna begin by praising you
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.420]   as a perfectly holy, transcendently pure,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.940]   high, lifted up, above all temptation,
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.780]   and all sin, and all limitations,
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.420]   kind of God that you are.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.500]   I praise you as an infinite God of knowledge,
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.380]   and infinite in power, and infinite in goodness.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.780]   We don't come to you because you need us.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.700]   You don't need us.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.940]   You are not served by human hands
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.820]   as though you needed anything,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.660]   but you give life and breath and everything,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.260]   including this prayer, right now.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.940]   You are the fountain, and we're thirsty.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.600]   You're the bread, and we're hungry.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.720]   You're the wisdom, and we're the foolish ones.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.320]   You are strong, and we are weak and needy.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.100]   You are righteous, we are guilty,
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.500]   and you are the treasure we long for,
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.820]   and we are bankrupt and poor.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.820]   That's the way we come.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.300]   We take refuge in your grace,
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.140]   in your righteousness, in your son.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.540]   We don't ask anything because of our merit.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.740]   Nobody listening to this, I hope,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.460]   God, don't let them ask anything
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.140]   because of their merit or their performance.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.020]   It's not because we are worthy of answers,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.680]   but because Christ is worthy of answers,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.920]   and we are in Christ.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.100]   That's what we mean.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.500]   That's what we mean, Father,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.900]   when we say we're coming in his name.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.020]   So for his sake, because of his blood,
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.580]   because of his righteousness, Father,
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.260]   and for his glory, we're asking now, deliver us.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.860]   Oh, Lord, from our bondage
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.840]   to the besetting sins of our lives.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.780]   Look upon the chains that have held us so long.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.360]   Have mercy on us, not because we're guiltless,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.420]   but because Christ died so that we might walk
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.820]   in the power of the Spirit.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.180]   He bought the new covenant, promises for us.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.780]   It grieves us, oh God, that we are so slow
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.260]   to live in the freedom that he purchased,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.340]   to be the people you've created us to be,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.700]   and we are sorry, and we confess
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.660]   that we have grieved your Spirit
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.940]   by the slowness of our hearts.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.060]   Open the eyes of our hearts to see
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.060]   and to savor at new and powerful levels
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.180]   the beauty of holiness and purity
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.060]   and patience and meekness and forbearance,
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.660]   the beauty of Christ.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.180]   Break our addiction to worldly pleasures
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.780]   and sinful responses to people like wives
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.260]   or husbands or children who frustrate us.
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.260]   Break our worldly responses of anger or of lust or of greed.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.340]   We're tired of being jerked around
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.060]   by the impulses of lust and anger and covetousness.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.900]   We want to be free by the power
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.660]   of a new expulsive satisfaction in you.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.540]   Oh, sweeten, sweeten our souls with grace.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.140]   Make us quick to hear, slow to speak,
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.520]   slow to anger, ready to forgive as we've been forgiven
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.700]   and eager to make peace by being wronged if necessary.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.820]   Help us not to have to have the last word
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.540]   in any kind of dispute.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.100]   Give us, oh God, the fruit of self-control.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.100]   You said it's the fruit of the spirit.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.420]   Give us the fruit of self-denial
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.220]   where our appetites for food and sex control us.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.780]   Don't let them control us anymore.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.640]   We hate being enslaved by anything or anyone but Christ.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.260]   Deliver us for your name's sake.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.660]   Save us for your name's sake.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.220]   Fill us with all-conquering joy
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.480]   for your name's sake, I pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.080]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.440]   And speaking of sin, what about those who are in our lives
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.780]   who are living in sin, they don't repent from it,
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.060]   and maybe they've been placed
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.800]   under church discipline as a result?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.500]   We're not to associate with unrepentant sinners
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.420]   in the church, but here's the kicker.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.140]   What if we're related to them?
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.220]   That's the question from a podcast listener tomorrow.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.100]   I'm your host, Tony Rank.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.900]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.060]   (silence)
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.220]   (silence)
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.380]   (silence)
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
