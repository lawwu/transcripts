[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   - So what's a wave function?
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.560]   You said it's an interesting detail.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Yeah.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.280]   - But in any interpretation,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.880]   what is the wave function in quantum mechanics?
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.120]   - Well, you know, we had this idea from Rutherford
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.040]   that atoms look like little solar systems.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.920]   But people very quickly realized
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.520]   that can't possibly be right.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.220]   Because if an electron is orbiting in a circle,
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.400]   it will give off light.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.840]   All the light that we have in this room
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.360]   comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.560]   and that's what electromagnetic waves are.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.440]   And you can calculate how long would it take
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.800]   for the electron just to spiral into the nucleus.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.440]   And the answer is 10 to the minus 11 seconds, okay?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.000]   100 billionth of a second.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.120]   So that's not right.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.380]   Meanwhile, people had realized that light,
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.060]   which we understood from the 1800s was a wave,
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.800]   had properties that were similar to that of particles, right?
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.560]   This is Einstein and Planck and stuff like that.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.380]   So if something that we agree was a wave
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.840]   had particle-like properties,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.720]   then maybe something we think is a particle, the electron,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.360]   has wave-like properties, right?
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   And so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.640]   don't think about the electron as a little point particle
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.960]   orbiting like a solar system.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640]   Think of it as a wave that is spread out.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.920]   They cleverly gave this the name the wave function,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.420]   which is the dopiest name in the world
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.040]   for one of the most profound things in the universe.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.300]   There's literally a number at every point in space,
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.160]   which is the value of the electron's wave function
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.000]   at that point.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.980]   - And there's only one wave function.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.460]   - Yeah, they eventually figured that out.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.780]   That took longer.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.860]   But when you have two electrons,
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.100]   you do not have a wave function for electron one
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.980]   and a wave function for electron two.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.280]   You have one combined wave function for both of them.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.020]   And indeed, as you say, there's only one wave function
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.140]   for the entire universe at once.
