[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280]   Will we pray in heaven?
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.840]   It's a really great question from a listener named Grant.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.600]   Pastor John, today in church we sang the old classic hymn,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.200]   "What a Friend We Have in Jesus."
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.840]   And the fourth verse is a line that says,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.220]   "Soon in glory bright and clouded,
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.080]   "there will be no need for prayer."
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.760]   Referring to when we are in heaven, of course.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   I don't know if I've ever sang that fourth verse before,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.000]   so the line jumped out at me.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.320]   It's jarring to hear the words, "There is no need for prayer."
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080]   So is prayer just an earthly thing?
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.080]   Is there a role for prayer in heaven?
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.960]   Does the Bible give us any indication
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.120]   of how we will commune with God in eternity?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.240]   Well, first let's say a word about the song
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.120]   and then about the question of prayer
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.520]   in heaven from scripture.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   I'm virtually certain that what Joseph Scriven meant
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.160]   in that line that he quoted from
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.440]   "What a Friend We Have in Jesus,"
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.440]   what he meant was that there will be no more aching cry
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.360]   to help us in our troubles in heaven
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.880]   because there'll be no more troubles.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.460]   We won't be crying out for help in our troubles
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.600]   because we won't have any troubles.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.040]   Now, the reason I think that's all he meant
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.660]   is because when I reread the whole song,
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.200]   that's the way virtually every verse was defining prayer.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.640]   Let me just read it for you,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.200]   and I'll try to highlight these phrases.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.320]   "What a friend we have in Jesus,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.240]   all our sins and griefs to bear.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.800]   What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.520]   Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   Oh, what needless pain we bear,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.720]   all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.280]   Have we trials and temptations?
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.080]   Is there trouble anywhere?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.660]   We should never be discouraged.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.500]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.140]   Can we find a friend so faithful
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.360]   who will all our sorrows share?
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.640]   Jesus knows our every weakness.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.000]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.100]   Are we weak and heavy-laden,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.960]   cumbered with a load of care?
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.640]   Precious Savior, still our refuge.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.960]   Do your friends despise and forsake you?
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.320]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.800]   In His arms He'll take and shield you.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.360]   You will find His solace there."
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.460]   And then comes that last verse.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.960]   "Blessed Savior, Thou has promised
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.520]   Thou will all our burdens bear.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.560]   May we ever, Lord, be bringing all to Thee
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760]   in earnest prayer.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.600]   Soon in glory, bright unclouded,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.320]   there will be no need of prayer."
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.040]   Which I take to mean no need to ask God for help
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   to bear our burdens, to bear our troubles,
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.440]   to bear our sorrows, to bear our griefs,
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.880]   to bear our pain, to bear our temptations.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.080]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.760]   - That's good context.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.720]   - Rapture, praise, and endless worship
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   will be our sweet portion there,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.200]   which clearly implies communication, right?
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.460]   So praise and worship will be our portion,
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.000]   and all of that is prayer.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.560]   So he did believe there would be prayer in heaven,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.300]   but he was defining prayer as the cry for help
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.840]   in the midst of our afflictions,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.000]   and there won't be any afflictions,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.120]   so there won't be any more of that in heaven.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.960]   Now, what about Scripture?
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.940]   Okay, that's scriven.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.920]   What about Scripture?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.860]   First, there are the visions in Revelation, right?
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.120]   Here are just two of them.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   We see prayer in heaven in Revelation 5.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.480]   "I heard every creature in heaven and on earth
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.080]   and under the earth and in the sea
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.520]   and all that is in them saying,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.600]   saying to him who sits on the throne
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.420]   and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.400]   and might forever and ever."
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.960]   In Revelation 7, "After this, I looked and behold
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.640]   a great multitude that no one can number from every tribe
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.160]   and from tribes and people and languages
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.320]   standing before the throne and before the Lamb,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.040]   clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.600]   crying out, praying with a loud voice,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.120]   salvation belongs to our God."
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.840]   We're saying that to the Lamb and to the Father.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.840]   And then consider Romans 8, 26 and 27.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.680]   This is really interesting.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.340]   It's a puzzling and provocative text
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.800]   about God giving us the Holy Spirit now
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   to help us pray when we don't know how to pray
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.360]   because God is so jealous that even in those moments
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.660]   when all we can do is groan to help us pray as we ought,
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.040]   that he sends his Holy Spirit
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.280]   to do the praying in us and for us.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.060]   The Spirit helps us in our weakness,
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.740]   for we do not know what to pray, how to pray as we ought,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.800]   but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.700]   with groanings too deep for words.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.580]   I think those are our groanings.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.140]   The Spirit is moving us even without words to groan,
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.260]   and he who searches the hearts
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.440]   knows what is the mind of the Spirit
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.240]   because the Spirit intercedes for the saints
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.600]   according to the will of God.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.500]   It seems to me that if God makes extra effort
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.460]   to keep us praying when we are weak in this world,
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.080]   how much more will he delight in hearing us
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.340]   when we have no perplexities about it at all?
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.320]   And then consider that the church
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.700]   is pictured as the bride of Christ in Ephesians 5,
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.820]   being prepared for eternal marriage
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.940]   with her husband, Christ, in spotless beauty,
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.740]   in a perfect relationship,
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.820]   likened to the best possible marriage.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.140]   Are we to think that there is no communication
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.540]   in this marriage?
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.260]   What marriage is that?
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.900]   It is inconceivable.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.740]   Or to be, here's more specific.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.740]   Several times, Jesus pictures coming back to earth
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.980]   as coming to share a feast table with his disciples.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.660]   You are those who have stayed with me in my trials.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.500]   I assign to you as my Father assigned to me a kingdom
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   that you may eat and drink at my table in the kingdom
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.860]   and sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.220]   Or another text, blessed are those who are invited
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.860]   to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.020]   You just can't conceive of Jesus inviting guests
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.380]   to a feast, feeding them well, giving them drink well,
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.140]   and nobody saying a word around this table.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.260]   That's not the way feasts work.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.180]   And finally, there's this climactic command
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.420]   to the whole earth in Psalm 66, three,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.420]   say to God, that's command, say to God,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.900]   how awesome are your deeds.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.120]   So great is your power that your enemies
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.420]   come cringing to you.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.880]   So we're commanded to say to God,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.700]   and I think that's designed as a command
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.100]   for the climax of the ages.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.300]   Not just along the way here,
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.020]   and then we don't ever say that anymore.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.500]   We don't say that to God anymore.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.260]   Conclusion, so yes, we will pray in heaven
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.660]   in the age to come.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.540]   We will communicate our hearts to God forever and ever,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.700]   and we will hear his heart for hours.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.540]   We will be shown ever fresh glories
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.180]   from the immeasurable riches of his kindness,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.180]   Ephesians 2, seven, and I think it says that
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.300]   so that we will see that our response
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.380]   with ever fresh words of our own
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.300]   corresponds to a communication that can never be boring
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.780]   because the riches of God's glory
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.940]   are endless and immeasurable.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.040]   So there's a correspondence between our capacity
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.780]   to respond with words to the ever fresh revelations
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.780]   of his beauty with ever fresh communications of our own
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.140]   so that we don't have to think,
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.540]   oh, I'm gonna run out of language.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.820]   Yeah, no, you won't.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.160]   Here you do, you do.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.740]   You run out of language here,
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.100]   but there you will not run out of language,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.260]   and like C.S. Lewis says,
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260]   the very expression of your joy in praise
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.940]   will not just be tacked on to the joy.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.420]   It will be the joy in God in consummation.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.260]   - Glorious.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.700]   Looking forward to that day.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.820]   Communicating our hearts to God forever,
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.900]   and we will hear his heart to us forever.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.040]   Amazing, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.060]   and thank you for listening along
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.040]   and for subscribing to Ask Pastor John
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.400]   in your favorite podcast app or in YouTube.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.060]   Next time we look at this question,
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.820]   how do I stay physically attracted to my aging spouse?
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.140]   How do I stay physically attracted to my aging spouse?
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.540]   I'm not asking the question, Adi.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.060]   No, this is an audience question I'm passing along.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.900]   I promise.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.940]   Have a great weekend.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.940]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
