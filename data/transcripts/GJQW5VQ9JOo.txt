[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   I used to feel mentally poor and I don't feel that way anymore.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.440]   So the congratulations, you have defeated the poverty in your brain,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.360]   because the minute you stop caring about money or fearing about money,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.160]   then you are mentally rich and you're living life the way
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.400]   life is supposed to be lived without worrying or thinking about money.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.680]   I'm still in the mental poverty side because I have a fear of losing it.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.000]   I have a fear that the next month it's going to dry up.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.120]   I have a fear that I don't have enough.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.720]   and I have a fear that I'm still enslaved to it.
