[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.440]   That's The Kim Commando Show, K-O-M-A-N-D-O. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.960]   dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.560]   live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.400]   years or less. On today's podcast, we continue our Financial Goals That You Should Set series.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   I'm laying out for you a series of simple, tangible financial goals that each and every
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.640]   person should consider setting for himself or herself, which, if you set these goals,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.320]   they will move you consistently, and in some cases, dramatically towards your goals.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.840]   I'm making a special focus to make these things meaningful and yet doable. I want them to be
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.600]   accessible to all people, especially the young, especially those who aren't making a lot of money
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.160]   yet. I want you to systematically move down the pathway of wealth. The first goal, goal number
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.120]   one, was simply get a job. The second goal was live on half your income, spend half, save half.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.000]   So far, by the way, that's probably the hardest one. But as I emphasized in that podcast, it's
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.040]   something that you can work towards systematically in a variety of different ways, even if your
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.320]   expenses were already high. Goal three was give away 10% of your income. And today, goal four,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:55.760]   I want you to begin or build, from where you are, a job or a career that has potential in the
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.480]   fullness of time to help you to become a top 20% earner. I want you to build a plan that will
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.360]   eventually, could eventually, in the fullness of time, help you to be in the top 20% of income
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.960]   earners within your local area. Now, I'm going to define that very carefully and specifically,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.440]   and I'll show you why this is such a big deal. But I actually want to begin with a slightly
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   smaller goal. As we do that, though, I want to begin by talking about the concept of 80/20
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.200]   principle or the Pareto principle. Pareto principle takes its name from, I think, an Italian guy many
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.760]   years ago, who, as the lore goes, he was out in his garden studying his garden's pea plants. And
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.400]   he discovered that about 20% of his plants were responsible for 80% of his garden's pea production
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   in a particular year. And so he started to count this and observe this. And he discovered that this
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.960]   principle held true year after year. And he started studying other factors, other kinds of examples,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.160]   and found that it holds true in many places. Over the many years since this was first discovered,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.880]   we continue to run into this basic principle of the universe. I don't know why it is. I'm
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.520]   not sure if anyone knows why it is. But it's just something that seems to accurately describe
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   much of human life. Not perfectly, but it's pretty good. So you can pretty well guess,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.960]   if you go into just about any company, you can pretty well guess that 20% of that company's
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   employees account for 80% of the profits of that particular company's results. Or if you go into
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.800]   a company's customer and you try to figure out who's responsible for the complaints, you can
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.720]   discover that about 20% of the company's customers are responsible for about 80% of the complaints
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.600]   that the customer receives. And it's just a principle that seems to hold true everywhere
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.120]   we look. And it also seems to hold true with regard to income and wealth. If you go in a
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.440]   society and you look around, you'll find that about 20% of people in just about any society
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.360]   hold about 80% of that society's wealth. And if you look at income earners, 20% of a society,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.440]   if the income earners account for about 80% of the society's wealth. In fact, we can look at this
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.880]   with regard to things like taxes. 20% of the taxpayers in the United States of America pay
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.320]   about 80% of the country's taxes. Now, there's not a precise number. It might be 25, 75. It might be
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.120]   30, 70, 15, 85. It's just a basic truism that it holds out to be about 20%, 80%.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   Now what's remarkable is that this is a truism that seems to hold true even further. So let's
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   go back to wealth as an example. The top 20% of wealthy people in a society hold about 80%
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.360]   of that society's wealth. Okay, so far so good. But what's interesting is within that top 20%,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:08.000]   you actually wind up with the top 20% of the top 20% or the top 4% hold about 80% of the 80%.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.880]   So the top 4% of a society should hold about 64% of the society's wealth. And then the top 20%
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:27.920]   of the top 4% should hold about 80% of the 80% of the 80%. So 80% of 64% winds up being about 51%,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.520]   which is why in most societies, the top 1% seem to hold about 50% of the society's wealth.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   And there's going to be slight variations of that, but it somewhat holds true.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   So we can look at society in this way and we can look around and try to think about, well,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.600]   are these static categories or are these movable? Do these change? And what is interesting is while
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.120]   this does describe, especially with wealth, somewhat statically what various people hold
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.120]   in terms of wealth, it's not the case with income. We know from US income tax data over the years
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.640]   that while we certainly know that the top 20% of taxpayers pay 80% of the taxes, people actually
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.240]   wander in and out of that top 20% consistently. And what's more important is simply if we look
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.320]   around, we can understand that while it may not be easy to get into the top 20%, it's extremely
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.440]   doable to get into the top 20%. That there are many ways to do that.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.560]   So I now want to talk about the actual numbers, but in doing so, I want to define a couple of
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.800]   statistical terms for those who may be unfamiliar. We're talking about averages here, and there are
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.000]   a variety of ways that we discuss averages. The most common way, when you first learn to average
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.160]   numbers together when you were in elementary school, was to take what we call the mean.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.040]   The mean is the arithmetic average of a data set. So you take all the different numbers, let's say
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.360]   you have five different numbers and you add them all up together and you divide by five, that gives
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.560]   you the mean or the average. Usually in the English language, when we say what's the average,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.720]   we usually refer to the mean statistical term to mean average. Now there are other terms that could
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.520]   also be used under the idea of average. The most common ones would be the median and the mode.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:27.920]   The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered across in range from lowest to highest.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.800]   And then the mode is the most frequently occurring value. For our purposes, the median wage is
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.720]   usually what we are going to talk about and the basic average that we're going to draw everything
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.040]   from because it's the most useful. Let me give you an example. Let's say that we have a sample
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.360]   set of five people. In this five people, we have earner number one earns $15,000,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.720]   person number two earns $47,000, person three $58,000, person four $72,000,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:12.160]   and person five $489,000. So we have one very low earner, one extremely high earner,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.240]   and then three people in that middle space. If you take the mean average of those five numbers,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   $15,000, $47,000, $58,000, $72,000, and $489,000, then your mean average would be $136,200.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.720]   So you can see that if I described to you that the average earnings of these five people is $136,000,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:42.240]   while that is correct and true, it wouldn't accurately represent how the group would feel
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.960]   because you would have four people who all felt pretty poor, and you would have one person who
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.000]   could say, "All right, that makes sense." If we take the median calculation, we just simply take
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.960]   the middle number. Again, our five numbers were at $15,000, $47,000, $58,000, $72,000, and $489,000,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:06.480]   so our median number is $58,000. That would feel if I said the average of this group or the median
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.920]   is about $58,000, then most people in that group would feel, "All right, that makes a lot of sense."
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.000]   The outlier, the only person who would say, "Wow," is the very high earner.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.680]   The idea here is this is the usefulness of talking about median wages as they describe
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.920]   fairly accurately a society because they diminish the impact of the very low numbers and the very
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.200]   high numbers, and they concentrate us on the middle numbers. So whenever we talk about wages
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.320]   or earnings, we're always going to use a median number because that'll reflect on, we know that
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.440]   50% of the population earns more than this and 50% of the population earns less than this.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.680]   So currently, as I understand it, for the first quarter of 2024, the median wages in the United
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:10:00.160]   States are just under $60,000, $59,228, something like that. Middle number is $60,000. I'm just
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.760]   going to round that to $60,000. So back to your financial goals. The first thing I would encourage
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   you to do is to calculate your annual wages against the median number and say, "Am I higher
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:22.080]   than $60,000 or lower than $60,000?" If your annual wages are lower than $60,000, you now know
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.400]   that you are in the bottom half of society with regard to overall earnings. If your wages are
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.600]   higher than $60,000, then you know that you're in the top half of society with regard to earnings.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.440]   This is the first goal that you should have. The very first goal should be to go from the bottom
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.720]   half to the top half. You should calculate your own achievement of that goal based upon the actual
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.560]   data that the government produces of actual earnings of real workers. The reason for this
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.760]   is it's difficult to figure out how you're doing when you're simply comparing yourself to other
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.680]   people without actually knowing the details of their life. If you're sitting around and looking
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.560]   at other people's consumption patterns or how much money other people seem or don't seem to have,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.320]   and you're trying to compare yourself to them, then you will have a hard time knowing how you're
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.840]   doing because everyone handles money differently. But you can be confident that if you are in the
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.000]   top half of income earners, then while that doesn't mean your life is necessarily going to be
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.960]   easy, you can be confident that you're going to be able to do just fine. You're going to be able
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.400]   to live. You're not going to starve this month. Now, I said your goal should be to go from the
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   bottom half of society to the top half of society with regard to income. Why can I state that goal
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.440]   confidently and say that everybody should set this? After all, we're not all above average.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:55.040]   That is true. We're not all above average. Most of us are probably pretty average. But we're talking
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:03.200]   here about behavior. And if we look at that number of $60,000, what I would say to you is almost
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.000]   anyone who's not uniquely handicapped in some way, especially disabled, facing some unique
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.200]   situationally difficult thing, almost anyone can cross from the bottom half of society's earnings
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.400]   to the top half of society's earnings just simply by hard work. And by hard work, I mean hard and
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.240]   long work. Let's back into the numbers. Let's assume we're trying to get to $60,000 of annual
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:38.640]   earnings. So we divide $60,000 by 52 weeks and we get a weekly earnings amount of $1,153. Let's
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:45.120]   assume that you work a lot. You work 80 hours a week. You have two jobs, which is doable as long
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.360]   as you're working six or seven days a week. Not easy, but it's doable. That means that your average
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:05.280]   earnings need to be $14.42 an hour. So if your hourly rate is $14.42 an hour, which is very close
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.520]   to the starting wage in many kind of leading economies. If you're in a small town, a very
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.440]   rural area, low cost of living area, then you're not going to start at $14 an hour. But if you're
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:25.760]   down in most places, I see lots of signs about $15 just starting wage at just random straightforward
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.840]   jobs, many times $12, $11. Even though federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:39.200]   that's not really a relevant number anymore. It's just a number that happens to be out there.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:45.680]   Real starting wages are probably pretty close to $15 an hour in most leading sectors of the market.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:55.600]   So technically, you could cross over that number in earnings based upon working two jobs. I don't
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.000]   want you to work two jobs. So I want you to set, first of all, an hourly goal that would allow you
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.360]   to earn one job and cross over that. So if you don't have any earnings right now, or you have
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.400]   your first job because you've accomplished goal number one, I want you to take $60,000 per year.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.080]   I want you to divide that by 52 weeks per year. So that's again, $1,153 per week and divide that
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:26.240]   by $40 per hour. And that gives you an hourly wage of $28.84. So my goal for you is that to begin
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:35.360]   with, you have a job potential or career potential that could lead to your earning $30 an hour.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:43.360]   Notice that I'm focusing on potential. Notice that I'm emphasizing that you should see a pathway
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.960]   forward to this. The idea is you may not be earning $30 per hour today. You may be earning
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.240]   $12 per hour, and that's fine. But what you need to do is you need to take the job that you're
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.360]   doing right now, the company that you're working for right now, the career or industry that you're
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:09.760]   engaged in, and you need to look around and you need to figure out, are there people who started
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:19.120]   where I am right now and who are now earning $30 an hour or more? Top half wages versus bottom half
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.320]   wages. If you can see those people, and if you can see a pathway from where you are right now
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.520]   to where you would be in the future, and you could see that if I keep working this and I show up on
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.520]   time and I do what I'm told and I keep my nose out of trouble and I get this certification or pass
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.440]   these training courses or whatever it is that I need to do, develop these skills, then I could
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.480]   be earning $30 an hour. You know you're on the right track. And this is why I want you to set
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.120]   this goal, because I need you to be thinking about the things that you would be doing towards that
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:00.160]   goal. So many people, especially young people, take a job and they say, "Hey, I'm doing great.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.280]   After all, I'm young. I'm single. I'm making $16 an hour. This is fantastic. Life is great. I can
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:14.800]   spend with abandon. I can live well. I'm doing great." But they may be working in something
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:23.120]   where there is no future potential. And then you reach that adulting stage of life where you want
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.320]   to get married, you want to start having children, and you face adult-level expenses, and yet you
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.520]   don't have an adult-level income. You're kind of stuck in that other world. So you need to be
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.840]   setting a goal of moving to the top half of wages versus the bottom half of wages. Because as long
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.320]   as you're in the top half of wages, while it may not be that you're getting rich fast and you have
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:53.760]   all kinds of disposable extra money, you can still live an adult lifestyle. You're going to be frugal,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   but you can still do fine. You're going to be doing well. And so you need to have a plan,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.880]   have a design, have a scheme that's going to get you into the top half of income earners.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.080]   I could sit here and off the top of my head list a dozen jobs or careers that are available to
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:21.680]   practically anyone, anyone who has few felonies, if any, anyone who could pass a drug test,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.960]   anyone who's physically able and able to show up and work hard during the time that he's on the
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:34.160]   clock that can get you into the top 50%. You can get to the top 50% just by hard work and being
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.640]   reasonably sociable, reasonably dependable, reasonably reliable. But this should be your
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:48.560]   first goal. Top 50%. Get over the median wage threshold and have a plan to do that. And ideally,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:55.200]   I would love it if your plan were no more than five years. I can see this. There's not an 18-year-old
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.280]   out there or a 16-year-old out there that I can't have you over the median wage with some plan
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.080]   by the age of 20. It's totally doable in, well, excuse me, 18 to 20 is fewer than the five years
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.040]   I said. Four or five years, five years. Give me 18 to 23, I can have you over the median wage. Give
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.560]   me 16 to 21, we can do that. There's lots of ways to do that. Even if you're not especially smart,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.360]   especially gifted, especially good looking, whatever the special things are, you can do
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:31.120]   this with hard work and with basic character. Now, most of my audience is past that. And I want to
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.840]   mention that, though, because this would be the first goal. Top bottom half to top half. But I
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:43.920]   really do now want to focus you on the top 20%. And I want you to have career potential to get
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.800]   into the top 20%. So what does that mean? Well, in the United States, to get into the top 20%
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:57.600]   of income earners in the United States, the number would be about $130,500. We're just going to call
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:05.840]   it 130,000, slightly more, $130,000 per year. So the real goal that after you've crossed from the
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:13.360]   bottom to the top, the real goal that I want you to set is $130,000 per year. Let's break that down
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:22.720]   into weekly wages. First, $130,000 divided by 52 weeks per year means a weekly wage of $2,500 per
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.680]   week. If we're going to divide that into a 40-hour work week, that's an hourly rate of $62 per hour.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   This is a goal that everybody should set. It's not a goal that everybody can achieve
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:46.160]   within a very short period of time. I would say many people can achieve this fairly quickly.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:54.640]   If you combine hard work with knowledge, study, skill acquisition, credentialization,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.240]   good connections, moving for work where work is needed, you can absolutely achieve this.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:06.880]   But when you get to the top 20%, it's very hard to get into the top 20% by pure physical effort.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:14.080]   There are many, many people who work hard at hard demanding jobs that will never be able to get into
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.960]   the top 20%. You can get to the top 50% by physically demanding effort, many hours. It's
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:25.600]   hard to get to the top 20%. You have to develop skills that the marketplace values. And that's
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.800]   why I want you to set this goal. I want you to start thinking about developing economically
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:36.080]   valuable skills, specific skills and abilities that the market is willing to pay you for.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.160]   These are skills and abilities that you're going to have to pay for first in their acquisition.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.440]   There are three basic pathways that you can use to acquire the kinds of skills and abilities that
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:56.560]   are going to lead you to being able to get into the top 20%. Or better than saying that three
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.520]   pathways, although there are, there's basically three gates. And you have to go through some of
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:08.160]   these gates, but you can't get there without going through the gate. So the first pathway
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.440]   or the first gate that you have to go through is the pathway of experience. Experience can be one
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.080]   on the job. There are many people in the world, many craftsmen who started off as a junior
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.680]   apprentice and went to work and showed up every single day and they did their job. They did what
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:31.280]   their boss told them and 30 years on into their career, they're now a top 20% earner. You can find
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:38.240]   this all over in the skilled trades of many, many people who have gone through this pathway. Earning
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.960]   $130,000 a year in the skilled trades is not common, but it's also not uncommon for those
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:54.400]   who have 30 years of experience. And so you can get to the top 20% the long way through on-the-job
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:02.880]   experience. Time in most things will lead to seniority, which affects pay scale. It leads to
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.840]   advancement in rank just by the fact that this guy has been showing up at the factory every
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:14.560]   single day. He's got to build those skills. It does lead to top 20% earnings. So if you see a
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.520]   pathway in your current career that if I just keep doing this and I do this for 30 years, I can get
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.000]   into the top 20%, then that's good. That's okay. Now the challenge is the 30 years, because a lot
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.040]   of times that 30 years means that the money comes when it's not quite as useful as it would have
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.240]   been if it had come faster. So you get out and you start your job at 20 years old when you get
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.360]   out of high school and get a job and you're a union worker and there's certainly with overtime
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.280]   and with full experience and cost of living raises, I can get into that top 20% when I'm
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.840]   50 years old. Yeah, but you're raising your children in your 30s and your 40s when that's
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.880]   when you need more money. And it's okay because even if you can, like we said, if you're top
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.320]   median, excuse me, in the top 50%, then you can afford to raise your children. And then at the
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.880]   back of your career, when you're 50 years old and you're earning top 20% wages, as long as you keep
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   your expenses down, you'll be able to fill up your retirement accounts. You'll be able to build
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   wealth very quickly. People on this pathway and most pathways tend to build a lot of wealth quickly
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.600]   in their 50s because they've gotten their expensive years behind them and just through
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   pure experience, they're at the top edge of the earning scale. So that's the first pathway that
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:34.480]   you can go down is the gate of experience, long-time perspective. Now, the second gate
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:41.040]   that you can go through is the gate of education. And let me quickly tell you the third gate because
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.480]   I'm going to contrast the second and the third. The second gate of education, I mean, based upon
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:54.960]   what you know, and you can know that in any way. Gate number three is paying for education
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:01.360]   and credentialization. The idea is education is something that you can gain usually for time and
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:07.680]   effort invested, but not for money. Gate number three includes education, but here I'm talking
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:13.120]   about paying for education with money. So you have to have money to go through gate number three.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:20.000]   Let's go back to gate number two. If you want to speed up the process of the long-time horizon,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.320]   you need to educate yourself in skills that are going to be useful to the marketplace,
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:33.120]   and you need to do that fairly quickly. This requires effort. So this is the gate of effort.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.480]   Gate number one is the gate of time. Gate number two is the gate of effort.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.640]   Effort is something that is available to all people, but that most people are not willing to
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:50.160]   do. Today, educational resources are basically free in the world. Most things you need to know
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.320]   to do something well are available free on the internet. If they're not free on the internet,
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.680]   they're probably available free at the library. With those two resources, you can find any bit of
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.080]   information that you need. So you can find the books, you can find the tutorials, you can find
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:10.480]   the classes, you can find the instructions, you can find those things, and you can exercise effort
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.120]   in order to build skills that are going to make you better, faster, more effective.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:22.160]   And so this gate of effort is something that can help you to not have to just rely on gate number
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:30.240]   one of time and move you faster. In any business or career, there are always people who go up the
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:37.040]   pay scale faster because they build the necessary knowledge and skills to go faster. So that's what
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.880]   you want to push on is push, if at all possible, on effort. Now, the third gate is the gate of
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:51.840]   money. Money is where you spend money in order to acquire the skills or the access that leads to the
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:26:00.000]   long-term, much higher earnings. So money usually, at this stage of your career, usually is spent
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.880]   most effectively on tuition payments to buy classes of some kind. Those classes can be blue
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:12.640]   collar, it can be welding classes and certification for plumbing work, it could be taking exams so
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.760]   that you can get certain licenses. Those classes will help you to move forward, but you have to
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:24.320]   have the money for those classes. The more common expression is some form of formal college degree.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.040]   Formal college degree is basically a pay gate. If you can pay the money for it and put forth the
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.240]   effort to get through it, then you'll come out and the pathway into the top 20% for most college
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:41.840]   graduates is much straighter than it is for those who aren't college graduates. So this is why I put
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:48.720]   step two or goal two first. Somebody who gets a job has income. Somebody who is spending 50% of
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:56.320]   his income has savings. And now those savings can be used to purchase the kinds of classes and
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.120]   credentials that will help you to move faster towards your goal of getting into the top 20%
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:09.840]   of earners. And so that should be your goal. You set the goal of saying, I want to earn $130,000
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:16.560]   per year under current numbers in the United States, or I want to earn $62 an hour. So what
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:24.320]   kinds of jobs or careers do I know of that are around me that could, in the fullness of time,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.240]   lead me to me being in the top 20% of earners? By the way, you get to define the fullness of time.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.320]   I would say doing it in a decade should be very reasonable. So if you're 20 years old
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.680]   and you're looking at age 30, 10 years, you can do a lot. You can put forth a lot of effort. You
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:47.280]   got 10 years of experience. And if you can pay money to get yourself the necessary credentials
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:52.240]   and knowledge that will help you move faster, you can do it in 10 years. So 10 years is, I think,
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:58.720]   a very reasonable goal for a lot of people. If you are a person of less capacity or less
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:05.120]   self-confidence, do it in 15 years. Totally fine. But you're going to be happy if you wake up at 35
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:11.920]   or 45 and you're in the top 20%. That's a really good goal. So set that goal and create a pathway
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.320]   for yourself to it. Anybody with a little bit of motivation, a little bit of hard work,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:25.360]   can lay out a plan to get into the top 20% of earners. Now, as I start to close, I want to
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:32.080]   simply encourage you that once you reach that goal, the top 20%, once you reach that goal,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:38.880]   then I think it's reasonable to set one more goal, to try to be in the top 4% of earners.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:46.080]   I don't think this is as open to as many people as I would like it to be. I have a never-ending
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.720]   confidence and belief in you and your ability to eventually achieve this. But I also acknowledge
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:56.640]   that statistically speaking, not everybody or most people can't be in the top 4%. Just doesn't
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.320]   happen that way. That's not how the numbers work. But I think that by setting a goal of 4%,
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.480]   that it's going to stimulate your creativity. Under current numbers, to be the top 4% of income
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:15.120]   earners in the United States, you need an annual income of about $250,000. $250,000 gets you in the
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:22.160]   top 4%. If you have a high degree of self-confidence, then make some kind of career
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:29.440]   plan that allows you to have the potential of earning top 4% numbers or $250,000 a year,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:35.920]   again, in the fullness of time. Have a 20-year career plan, a 30-year career plan that gets you
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:44.240]   to top 4%. This won't be available to everybody, but it really is doable for most people with
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:51.040]   planning. If you have normal or above average, again, work ethic, intelligence,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:30:00.960]   self-discipline, and self-confidence, this 4%, top 4% is largely a matter of a good plan
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:07.120]   and a disciplined focus on the plan over time. It's not magic. When we get to the very top
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:16.000]   numbers, the top 1%, the top half a percent, the top 0.1%, then achieving those kinds of numbers
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   requires unusual synchronicity of events. It requires you to be in the right career at the
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.120]   right time when external market conditions really make it pay off. It requires your company to be
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.400]   the one company out of 1,000 competitors that hits, and all your competitors were worthy and
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.880]   effective, but your company was the one that got bought out for a bazillion dollars.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:47.280]   So the very highest level of results are hard to predict. And because they're hard to predict,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.240]   I can't tell you how to do them. You can work towards them, but I can't just say,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.360]   "I can't sit down and make a plan for everyone." But when we're at the $250,000 number, again,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.280]   that top 4% number, we're still within the realm where this is totally plannable.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.880]   It doesn't have to be serendipitous. It's totally plannable. It's choosing a good career
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:16.080]   that produces work that is highly valued in the marketplace. It is a matter of you engaging in
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:22.240]   that, passing all of the gates necessary to establish yourself in that career, and then
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.960]   sticking to it for the sufficient amount of time until you just simply make it step by step.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:36.160]   So you can do this with predictability at the top 4%. Top 1% number of earners in the
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.600]   United States is $600,000 currently, about $600,000, and then from there on up.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:49.680]   I would say that maybe for significantly above average, people of significantly above average
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:56.400]   ability, you can just plan your way to top 1%. And so keep planning your way as far as you can,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.560]   and then prepare yourself to take advantage of market opportunity when it presents yourself.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.520]   But that's about as high as you could probably plan without relying on taking advantage of all
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.040]   of the breaks that you're offered in the fullness of time. So let's go back and review. First and
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:18.080]   foremost, you had to get a job. Second, I want you to spend half your income and control your
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.960]   expenses so that you have money available. And what I was really earmarking is goal three of
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:29.600]   giving money away. And once you have that money available to buy your way into a pathway that
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:35.760]   allows you to earn a top 20% income. And so that's why it's so important that from the very beginning,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:41.440]   you spend half, save half, so that you can buy your way onto the fast track. And here in today's
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:50.080]   goal, begin with getting from bottom half to top half, doable for anybody with those conditions
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.360]   that I described. But create a plan that in the fullness of time moves you into the top 20%.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:04.320]   And then once you reach that target, the top 20% of the top 20% or the top 4%. When you reach this,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:11.040]   you will know many people who are making a lot more than you. And you will look around and you'll
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:16.560]   say, I'm just dissatisfied because so and so are in so much more than I do. And I wish I was doing
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.320]   what that person does. That's normal, because you're comparing yourself to your peers. But
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:27.680]   don't ever forget that you are in the very rarefied air at the top of society. And so
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:33.920]   you'll start to take it for granted. Everyone does. Don't take it for granted. And that's one
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.880]   final hope that I had for today's show is that to accomplish the idea of simply saying,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.800]   don't take this stuff for granted. Focus on getting yourself to the top levels and appreciate
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.680]   that once I'm there, life is good. Now, one final comment. Go back. Let's assume that you make top
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:59.440]   20%. Why this number? Do you remember what I said about spend half, save half? The reason it's so
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:06.800]   important to focus on getting into the top 20% is that you will still be able to live well
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:15.280]   and save half your income. And the saving half your income is the fast track to enormous wealth.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:23.680]   Remember, median wages, bottom 50%, top 50% in the United States, about $60,000. At $60,000,
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.200]   if you have children and a few just normal deductions, you don't pay much tax in the
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:35.120]   United States. If you're earning $130,000 per year, you're going to be paying some tax now.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:43.280]   But assume that you spend half, save half. $130,000 a year of earnings, you're going to spend
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:50.560]   $65,000 a year, save $65,000. But of course, there's going to be some taxes. Call it $10,000
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:58.080]   of tax. Now, you're to the point where you can spend $60,000 and you can save $60,000. And since
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.240]   we know that median wages are about $60,000, then you're going to be in a wonderful position
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.320]   to live a normal lifestyle, to be able to afford all of the normal things that
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   most people in society can afford and still save 50% of your income. That's what's so powerful
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.720]   about targeting the top 20%. That's what's so powerful about always focusing on increasing
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:32.080]   your income. As you do this systematically, it allows you to save a lot and live well.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   Now, if you could go to that final level, that top 4%, well, it's a top 4% income earner,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:45.120]   about $250,000. We're going to have some taxes, so pull off $20,000, $30,000 of taxes.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:52.800]   You're left with a lifestyle. If you save half, spend half, you're left with the lifestyle of a
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:36:00.640]   top 20% consumer. $250,000 divided by two, $125,000 to spending, $225,000 towards saving
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:07.280]   and giving. That leaves us with $125,000 minus taxes, pull off $20,000 for taxes, we've got $105,000.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:14.720]   We're similar in lifestyle to just a standard top 20% earner who's not really saving much money.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.800]   When you get to the top 20%, those people save money. You're living at a top 20% lifestyle,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:29.040]   but you're saving 50% of your income. That is the fast track that allows you to, as I stated before,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:36.000]   be financially independent within 20 years or so, and yet also be able to dramatically impact
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.280]   the world. I hope that this is as inspiring to you as it always has been to me. Take this as a
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:49.760]   series of steps and map out a pathway that works for you based upon where you live, the opportunities
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.000]   that are available to you, the culture that you're involved in, the education that you have, the
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.040]   opportunities that you can see in front of you. First goal, get over the median wage, get into
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:08.160]   the top 50%. Next, the real goal, get into the top 20%. Everyone can do that who's listening to my
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:17.360]   voice. Then the stretch goal, get into the top 20% of the top 20% or the top 4%. That's the sweet
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:23.760]   spot. If you can go higher, go higher, but that's the sweet spot. Give yourself as long as you need,
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:31.840]   20 years is perfectly fine, 30 years is okay, but make certain that you're working in a job or a
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.600]   career that can result in you being at that earning capacity in the fullness of time.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:47.920]   It is enormously frustrating for an intelligent, capable man to be working in a job that is simply
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:56.160]   capped, that he'll never make a lot more money because the job that he chose, the career that
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:04.000]   he chose is capped at this relatively modest number. You can't get there overnight, but what
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.480]   you can do is make certain that you're working in a job or a career where you can see that pathway
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.040]   of advancement. If you can see that pathway of advancement and you can know that in the fullness
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:22.080]   of time, I can be at top 20 or top 4%, then you're going to be confident that you can achieve all of
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.680]   your other goals. That's why this is such a powerful goal. Thank you for listening. I'll
