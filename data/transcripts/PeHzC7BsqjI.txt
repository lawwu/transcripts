[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   So to understand the deep reset, I want to talk about three different forces that exist
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:18.160]   in the world today that I think are going to converge together to create this new phenomenon.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   I'm Kyle Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 219.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.080]   If you're new to this program, it's a show where I answer questions from my audience
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.920]   about the theory and practice of living and working deeply in an increasingly distracted
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   world.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.520]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.120]   Jesse, I have a long list of news items relevant to the show that I want to share, which makes
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.240]   me excited because this tells me we're actually doing things, that change is afoot.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.240]   So it's nice to have several different things to share with our audience here that they
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240]   can be excited about.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.080]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.400]   Number one, we've long talked about doing a live event, some sort of live recording
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.720]   of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   And now we actually have an opportunity to do more or less that.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.320]   On Monday, November 14th at 7 p.m. at the East City Bookshop down by Capitol here in
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.640]   Washington, DC.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.120]   I will be doing an event with my friend, the author, David Sachs.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.840]   You might know David because of his book, The Revenge of Analog.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.960]   That's something I talked about in depth in my book, Digital Minimalism.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.720]   David has a new book out called The Future is Analog.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   He's doing a book event at East City Bookshop.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.360]   He asked if I would moderate the event.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.680]   So if I would interview him essentially at the bookshop and I said yes.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.160]   So this will be essentially a live episode of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   It'll be me.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.360]   Jesse will be there.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.560]   I'll be interviewing David Sachs on stage.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.720]   So it'd be great to see people who are in the DC area who only know our voice or have
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.800]   only seen our videos come to the East City Bookshop Monday, November or November 14th
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   at 7 p.m.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   That should be fun.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.640]   I also want to talk about our new weekly update videos.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.600]   So as we mentioned last week, we're trying an experiment with recording each week an
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.120]   episode that looks a little bit closer inside my life as a writer, professor and podcaster.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   Talks about what I'm up to, my struggles, have a few sort of show and tells in there
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   along the way.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.320]   So last week we posted the first weekly update video where I gave a tour of the Deep Work
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   HQ.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   So if you've been wondering what the HQ looks like, that long promised tour is now available.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.320]   YouTube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.360]   You'll find that weekly update number one.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.240]   By the time this episode airs, our second weekly update video will be available on our
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   YouTube page.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.920]   I'm going to get into some more details about my writing schedule, some of the struggles
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.400]   I'm having to keep that writing schedule.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   And there's also a special surprise I have in store that I think Deep Questions listeners
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   will appreciate.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   So go check out those videos.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.960]   Finally, live calls.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   These are continuing to progress on track.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.800]   Last week, Jesse predicted that by the end of October, we would have at least one live
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.720]   caller in these episodes where a listener actually calls and I can talk to him back
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.160]   and forth and we can get into it with their issue or hear their case study.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.240]   We're still on track, I think, right, Jesse, would you say?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.720]   Yeah, we're good.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440]   By the end of October, we should, you should start hearing live calls.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.680]   I'm excited about that.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.560]   We also have some interviews lined up.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.160]   I'm still trying to figure out exactly how I want to integrate interviews into the show.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.320]   I don't know if I want full episodes dedicated to long interviews.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.520]   I don't know if I want guests to essentially call in and just talk about one topic for
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.400]   a little bit of time.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.720]   I don't know if I want interview episodes to replace the normal q&a episodes or be separate
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.880]   episodes released each week.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   All this is up in the air.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.400]   So for now, I'm just lining up a bunch of stuff talking to a bunch of people.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.080]   We'll see what works and what doesn't.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.680]   A couple of expert interviews on the books I'm pretty excited about.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.360]   So just to give you a preview, a friend of mine who is a New York Times bestselling thriller
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.560]   writer, she's going to come on the show and talk to us about the reality of being a professional
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   genre writer.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.440]   How you do that, what's it like, how she got there, I think that should be fun.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   I also have a psychologist from Brown University lined up who is an expert on work with family,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.840]   the impact of having a family being a parent on your ability to do work and how to balance
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.080]   out that issue.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.640]   The fact that having a family reduces, notably the time available to actually work on things
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.960]   is something that not only do I struggle a lot with is actually one of the key motivators
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.720]   for my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.680]   Slow Productivity in part is a philosophy that will be very applicable for parents to
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.040]   help us sort of make sense of this reality that we don't have as much time as we used
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.320]   to and not feel bad about it.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.640]   It's something I hear about a lot from listeners.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.840]   I get a lot of notes from this, people who are also struggling with parenting, how that
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   drags on their time.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.960]   Women talking about how they have this much worse than the men, how that drags on their
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   psyche.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.840]   So we have this Brown psychologist going to come on in a few weeks and she's going to
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.440]   help straighten this all out.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.000]   I also have Jenny Blake, friend of the show.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.520]   She sent me a note a little while ago about her Zettelkasten setup for capturing notes.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.280]   She heard me talk about me needing a better note capturing system.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.960]   She's going to call in an upcoming episode and walk me through setting up a more sophisticated
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   setup.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.160]   So a lot's coming up.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.080]   A lot of this is fun.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.640]   And to me, this is all good news.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.760]   You know, I mean, Jesse, I like that we're experimenting.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.000]   The way I see it is we have breathing room this fall because I'm not teaching, I'm on
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   teaching leave.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.120]   When we get to the winter and spring, my schedule's locking in.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.360]   The podcast has got to be, we do it when we do it, it's going to be very locked in, kind
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   of getting out of the way of Georgetown.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   So I want to be at a new steady state by the winter where we have the new segments really
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.080]   rock and rolling, our structure really rock and rolling.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.240]   I think things are only going to get better from here.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.280]   You know, and one other quick thing, you sent out the Dracula article to your newsletter
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   about Aberdeen.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   Oh, I did.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Yes.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.560]   Yeah, I golf there over the summer in Aberdeen.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.720]   So I sent it to my golfing buddies and they thought it was really cool because it's right
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.040]   on the front on the water.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.600]   So I knew exactly what the walk that he was doing.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.200]   So did it feel Transylvania, Gothic sort of spooky?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.440]   Oh, it kind of did because I was playing from the back tees and I was getting beat up that
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   day.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.160]   So you felt as if your golf playing ability was getting sucked out like a vampire sucking
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   blood.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   I love that.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.720]   I think this gives me a new goal.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.120]   I want to be perched on a rock like a bat near the golf course in Aberdeen.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.120]   Oh, there are so many cool places over there.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.720]   You could like think and get inspiration.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.520]   All the courses are pretty much on the, they're all like Pebble Beach.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   This is great.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.440]   So if you didn't, did I talk about that on the show?
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   Yeah, I did.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   Right.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.440]   Okay.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.560]   So if you don't know what we're talking about, go back to the mailbag segment of episode
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   two 18 where I talked about an article from the guardian about how Bram Stoker retreated
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   with his family up to the remote coast of Scotland and Aberdeen to be motivated or inspired
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   to write Dracula.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.280]   I also wrote in more detail about this in my newsletter.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.880]   Hey, that's another plug.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   If you don't subscribe to my newsletter, you should just do so at calnewport.com and
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.240]   roughly once a week I send out essays on these type of topics.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.960]   So I went deep on the Stoker story recently in my newsletter.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.320]   All right.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.840]   I think we're out of things to update or promote at this point, Jesse.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.680]   So let's look ahead at the show that we have today.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.040]   It's a good one.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Here's the plan.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.800]   Three segments, segment number one, a deep dive.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.040]   I'm going to revisit a topic that is from the very early days of this show and I have
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.500]   a more pragmatic thought through take on it.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.080]   Segment number two, questions.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.560]   We have a good collection of questions and including at least one voicemail call from
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.920]   listeners, some nuts and bolts topics, some deep life topics, at least one technology
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   topic.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.520]   Segment number three, the mailbag returns.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.800]   I open up my interesting@calnewport.com inbox and go through a selection of some of the
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.680]   more interesting things people have sent me, articles, videos, thoughts, pointers, etc.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.280]   Over the past week.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280]   So that's our plan.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.200]   So let's get started with the deep dive.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.280]   So the topic of the deep dive today is the deep reset.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.160]   Now the deep reset is a term I introduced in my email newsletter and talked about briefly
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   on this podcast back in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.640]   I want to revisit it today and make it more structured, make it more pragmatic.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.100]   So to understand the deep reset, I want to talk about three different forces that exist
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:42.180]   in the world today that I think are going to converge together to create this new phenomenon.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.640]   So if you're watching instead of listing, so if you're watching the video of this segment
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:51.380]   at youtube.com/calnewportmedia, you'll see I have the tablet up here where I've listed
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:58.320]   three different forces and I'm going to write right in the middle here, deep reset, because
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.160]   these all handlers, beautiful, these all are feeding into the deep reset.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   All right.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.240]   So what are the forces that I think are going to feed into this thing?
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.360]   I'm going to call the deep reset first, the fact that millennials are approaching middle
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   age.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.200]   So let's be precise about demographics here.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.320]   People use these generation descriptions, I believe, too vaguely.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.840]   We're in the bad habit, for example, of using the word millennial to mean young person.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.560]   But let's be very demographically specific here.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:36.480]   The millennials, by most accounts, are more or less people born between 1981 and 1996.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.320]   So that puts Jesse and I at the older end of the millennials.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.640]   So we're 40.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.360]   The youngest millennials are in their late 20s.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.160]   The bulk of this generation is in their 30s right now.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.840]   So these are more or less the children of the baby boomers.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   All right.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.320]   So the millennials are approaching middle age.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.440]   Jesse and I are older, but the rest of them are going through their 30s.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.680]   This is a very important cultural shift because the millennials is a very large population
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   boom.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.100]   The baby boomers was a very large population boom.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.560]   So their children is itself going to be a very large boom.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.360]   That's why our demographic was originally called the echo boom, because it was an echo
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.000]   of the baby boom.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.400]   So we have this very large group population demographic that are now approaching middle
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.480]   age, which means those that are going to end up, let's say, getting married or starting
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.120]   a family, they're doing that right now.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   All right.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:39.800]   Number two, second of three forces relevant in the world right now, is the philosophy
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:47.720]   of work as a means to an end that the millennials have developed over the past, let's say, 20
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   years.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.520]   So we got into this briefly in my deep dive from episode 218.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.440]   So just to give you the short summary here, when the millennials were growing up, so this
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.880]   was the 1990s into the early 2000s, when the first millennials were growing up, their parents,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.440]   the baby boomers, wanted to offer them advice about what to do with their career.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.120]   Now the baby boomers had these two extreme experiences.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.920]   When they were little, they had seen their parents had had this sort of corporate conformist
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   experience.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.640]   This was the era of the organization man.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.680]   This was the 1950s in which you moved to the suburbs and you dedicated your life to IBM
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.860]   and they would give you lifetime employment in return.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.480]   As people left this urban cores of cities and small villages, these corporate loyalties
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.180]   became a substitute for civic engagement.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.120]   So it was a time of conformity, but it also sort of made sense.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.240]   These are the same people who had subordinated themselves to the larger cause of fighting
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.200]   fascism during World War II.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   So they were used to this idea, subordinate yourself to the larger cause as a source of
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   meaning.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.560]   The baby boomers didn't buy that because by the time you get to the 60s, you have all
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.140]   these social disruptions happening.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.520]   You have the civil rights movement, you have Vietnam, you have the women's liberation movement,
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.720]   all of these social forces, these social disruptions are happening.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:09.320]   And suddenly their parents ethos seemed stiflingly conformist.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:16.040]   And so the baby boomers created the countercultural movement, which went hard the other way.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.600]   So now we had, let's get rid of work altogether.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.720]   It's an obstacle to self actualization.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.040]   Let's go back to landless, move the communes.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.360]   You know, you're going to find yourself outside of work.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.160]   That fell apart too.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.680]   So by the time the baby boomers were having kids, like how do we balance these two forces?
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.440]   And they came up with, I think at the time, a clever innovation.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.920]   We'll tell our kids to follow their passion.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.940]   See this is a tightrope act right here.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.420]   The idea, the counterculture idea of forget work, you know, just go move to a commune
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.280]   and self actualize.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.640]   That didn't work, but they also still distrusted pure corporate conformity.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.800]   So they had this compromise.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   All right, you still need to get a job and pay your mortgage payments and make a living,
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.560]   but make it a job you love.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.660]   So now the job itself can be a source of meaning and fulfillment.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.460]   So this is what we saw as millennials.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.560]   We were taught this idea of follow your passion.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   That then fell apart.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.320]   Again, I talked about this last week, but that then fell apart in the early 2000s.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.220]   We had 9/11, the financial crash after 9/11.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.020]   We barely got back on our feet before the 2008 financial crash happened.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.160]   This was the period when the bulk of the millennial generation was leaving college and entering
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.260]   the workforce.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:40.200]   This idea that you should just follow your passion, that idea began to lose steam.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.300]   Employment seemed much more precarious.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.440]   The instrumental value of money to stave off hardship and support things that are meaningful
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.860]   became much more clear when people were going through hard times.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.440]   And so the millennials in general moved past the follow your passion notion and began to
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.620]   work on an alternative philosophy of work as a means to an end.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.920]   This is the hack work culture.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.080]   This is what's captured in the minimalism movement.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.940]   This is what's captured in Tim Ferriss' lifestyle design.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.120]   This is what's captured in the fire movement.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.000]   This is what's captured in early influencer videos on Instagram and YouTube where you
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.900]   see millennials focusing on lifestyle.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.700]   It's the moms in the white linen dresses walking through the fields with their kids.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.860]   It's the sort of impossibly ripped dads doing feats of endurance and YouTube videos.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.820]   The lifestyles being pushed to the millennials by millennials, it was not about work.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.060]   It was meaning in life.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:41.740]   Work was a funding source for running endurance races and having only white dishes on white
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.700]   shelves in your walls at your house.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.820]   So that's this big shift.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:52.140]   The millennials are very attuned to this idea that follow your passion, forget that.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.860]   Work supports other things that are important.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.380]   It's a source of money.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.380]   We can take it.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.380]   Maybe you'll get some mean out of it.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.660]   Maybe you don't like your job, but it's a financial backing for the systematic construction
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.660]   of a life that's meaningful.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.820]   So we've adopted that.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.980]   And this is very generational.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.540]   Gen Z, for example, the generation born after 1996, who's just now entering the workforce,
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.460]   as we talked about last week, they have their own ideas.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.660]   They're right now, they're stuck on this notion of quiet quitting.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.180]   They're just taking the first basic steps of saying, what is work going to mean to us?
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.780]   But for the millennials, we've been through this work as a means to an end.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.780]   All right.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.980]   So millennials approaching middle age, millennials adopting a work as a means to the end philosophy.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.580]   And then we add the third element, the catalyst to this particular metaphorical biochemical
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.860]   mixture, and that is pandemic disruptions.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.740]   So the pandemic comes along, disrupts work.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.020]   Everything goes remote.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:55.420]   The pain points that people feel with their jobs are amplified.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.420]   At the same time, the idea that you have more freedom and flexibility in configuring your
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.160]   work and your life was also amplified.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.220]   People were moving.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.100]   They were doing different schooling configurations with their kids.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.300]   They were pushing back on things.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.620]   People were leaving jobs.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.180]   There's this spirit of, hey, anything can go.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.580]   Things are so bad that there's really nothing off the table now.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:27.440]   And it inculcated this idea of change is possible.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.020]   So I think those three things are going to come together for this particular generation
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.740]   to lead to a lot of people to engage in what I call a deep reset.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.940]   So I have a definition for this.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.660]   I'm scrolling up if you're watching this online.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.180]   Here's a definition of a deep reset.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:50.820]   It's an intentional reconfiguration of your life to amplify the small number of things
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:57.260]   you've learned through experience that you value and minimize those things that get in
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   their way.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:04.020]   So a deep reset is saying, wait a second, let's step back and reconfigure our whole
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.480]   life.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.420]   And I think at this moment, the millennials in particular, because of those three forces
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.020]   coming together, have begun doing these deep resets.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.340]   And this is going to be a very important work trend in the next handful of years that are
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.340]   coming up ahead.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.720]   Now, I want to point out, this is different than a midlife crisis, which is a phenomenon
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.280]   that afflicted our parents.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.820]   The midlife crisis came at a similar point in people's lives as their 30s went into their
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.620]   40s, but it was much more haphazard, self-focused, and less intentional.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:41.000]   The midlife crisis was famously characterized by people realizing, oh my God, my life is
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.180]   halfway done.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.540]   What am I doing?
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.980]   Let me respond haphazardly.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.780]   I'll buy a sports car.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.820]   I'll get divorced and married a 25 year old.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:58.660]   I'll do a dramatic sort of visible narcissistic lifestyle changes to try to distract or stave
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.100]   off or avoid the inevitable conclusion that I'm getting older.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.020]   That's very different than the deeper reset, which is much more intentional, much more
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:12.380]   focused on your whole life, your whole family, much more focused on amplifying meaning, not
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.740]   avoiding things that are distressing.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.180]   So what might go into a deep reset?
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.640]   Well, here are some things I've seen.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.300]   Work simplification is a big part of that.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.300]   So people really rethinking the role of work.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.420]   So we get a lot of, for example, ledge stepping.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.460]   That's a term for where you've been going up the ladder at your organization and you
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.300]   say, you know what, I'm fine where I am right now for a while.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.760]   Let me step off the ladder onto a ledge where I can just hang out.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.460]   So without the need to strive to get to the next level, it reduces the pressure and the
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.180]   amount of work on your plate.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:57.100]   So as you approach middle age as a millennial, you may already have a lot of career capital,
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.300]   have a really a job that's at that right balance.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.860]   You have a lot of leverage, a lot of autonomy.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:06.460]   It's probably a reasonable place where you could ledge step for a while without it being
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.700]   boring or as it would be if you tried when you're 22 and you're still in an entry level
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.700]   position.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.180]   So we definitely see work simplification.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:18.220]   People also going all remote could be a work simplification move, reduced hours as a work
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.380]   simplification move.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:26.580]   Those are people running small businesses, eliminating streams of income, the focus on
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.220]   just a smaller number of things is work simplification.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.960]   So it's all about reducing that work volume that's coming at you from your job.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.300]   That's common in deep resets.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:43.020]   A term that I just made up, but I'm trying to popularize, candle fire, capital F-I-R-E,
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.340]   goes along with this.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:49.780]   So fire is this millennial movement, financial independence, retire early that we've talked
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.780]   about on the show before.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.700]   And it was a movement that came out of the tech world about super aggressively saving
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.300]   while living aggressively cheaply so that you could achieve financial independence at
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.500]   a relatively young age.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.820]   What I think we're seeing a lot more of now is what I call candle fire, the candle being
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:14.620]   referenced to a small flame in which the idea is not, oh, I need to be financially independent.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:20.100]   That is, I can live entirely off of my saved assets, but instead let's bring down our cost
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:28.700]   of living substantially so that with a simplified work portfolio, we can still support ourselves.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.860]   So it's not leaving work and living entirely off your investments.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:38.740]   It's moving to the cheaper location, getting rid of one of the cars, moving to the cheaper
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   location.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.580]   We're homeschooling instead of private school.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.760]   Our expenses are lower, so now I don't have to work as much, but I'm going to leverage
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.460]   the fact that I have a lot of career capital.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.460]   I'm 35.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.460]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.460]   I'm in demand.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.360]   It's not that hard for me to negotiate a part-time contractor position.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.360]   It's half the money.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.180]   We live on half the expenses and there we go.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.700]   We have a nice life with a lot less work.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.860]   So candle fire, we're going to see a lot of that.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.900]   That's going to go alongside work simplification.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.900]   Relocation is big.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.300]   We saw a lot of this during the pandemic.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:16.820]   I call it intentional relocation because it's moving for intentional value-based reasons.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.020]   Two examples from my own life.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:26.020]   We have friends who were kind of overwhelmed by the crowdedness and the stress of the Washington
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.900]   DC suburbs.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.380]   Both their jobs were remote for the most part.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.740]   They really like outdoor activities.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.900]   They really like skiing.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.660]   You know, God help them.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.740]   They were trying to get their skiing in each year in West Virginia.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.440]   There's only so many mountains around here.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   They're not that great.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.980]   And so they moved to Colorado, right outside Boulder, half hour from a great ski slope,
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.680]   mount the bike all the time, intentional relocation.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.700]   Another friend of mine worked for the government, was a lawyer for the government.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:04.580]   They're enjoying life here, but his family was from Santa Fe and they're like a long
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.620]   running Santa Fe family, sort of like his family runs the town.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.860]   They've been there since you were fighting off Indian raid type things.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.200]   And they were all there.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.380]   So he negotiated like, hey, in the height of the pandemic, when anything went, he negotiated
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.380]   a permanent remote work and they moved to Santa Fe.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.380]   He sends me photos.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.140]   He has a cool Adobe style house with a hill in the backyard.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.340]   There's a gazebo at the top of it.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.240]   He goes up there to watch the sunset, all of his family's there.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.020]   It's all thickly connected connections, intentional relocation.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.100]   You're going to see a lot more of that.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.240]   We will also see deep community involvement.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.540]   This is something else that happens in deep resets where people get deeply involved in
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.980]   communities that are meaningful for them.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.220]   This could be family communities.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:51.740]   Like my friend who moved back to Santa Fe is now deeply connected to all sorts of different
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   relatives.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.740]   They're in each other's lives.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.900]   There's pluses and minuses, but generally we were a familial tribal familial tribal
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.900]   species.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.900]   So that's usually positive.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.980]   Sometimes it'll be, let's say like a faith based community.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.660]   I'm going to get really seriously involved in my temple, right?
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.260]   In my, in my whatever, my mosque.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.800]   Maybe it's a more like an activist community.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.620]   This is a cause that's important to me and I'm going to get deeply involved in it.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.340]   So we're seeing more of investment of amplifying time spent in things like that that are useful.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.920]   And then finally, deep play and self-development.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.820]   People dedicating serious time to, it might be leisure activities.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.060]   I mean, I think my brother is an example of this.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.660]   Outdoor activities in particular, mountain based activities are really important to them.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.460]   And they've really built a lifestyle that involves lots of trips to the mountains, hiking,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.540]   Alpine, Mike, skiing, mountain biking, trail running.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.520]   And he's built the way his life works, his schedule to do a lot of that.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.740]   But you might see this with other types of self-development as well.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.080]   Someone, you know, I'm really going to invest in philosophy.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.980]   I want to become an expert on this type of philosophy, health and fitness.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.740]   I'm going to spend a lot of time outside.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.980]   I'll give you one more example.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.660]   There's a writer who wrote the book.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.420]   His name's Christopher McDougall.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:22.780]   He wrote the book Born to Run, which was a surprise bestseller that started the barefoot or vibram shoe running craze.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:27.740]   And it's a cool book about a New York based reporter who runs a lot and just was
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.220]   trashing his knees.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:36.580]   And he goes and spends time with this native tribe in Mexico that do these long endurance runs.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.820]   It's a tradition and they do it barefoot.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.300]   And he goes down this rabbit hole and finds out that, OK, actually barefoot movements, what we're meant to do.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   And you put in these big cushioned shoes, you get hurt, et cetera.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.500]   Anyways, he writes this book.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:55.020]   New York based reporter ends up really getting into this type of stuff, relocates to a farm.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.260]   I believe he's in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.780]   So in Amish country, it's this farm with this barn.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.260]   And there's these videos of him that Outside Magazine did.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:12.460]   You can find where he's he's out there now, barefoot doing these Rocky Four style physical training activities, climbing
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.900]   ropes in his barn and throwing hay bales around.
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.180]   Then he built this life that has a huge amount of physical activity in it.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.500]   Outside, interesting physical activity.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.260]   All these are examples of the same point.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:30.980]   Investment, almost a radical investment in this case, in deep play or self-development.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:37.180]   These are the type of things that you're going to see when people conduct a deep reset, simplification, amplification,
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.540]   usually with a couple of these changes made more radical.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:46.060]   You can have some radical moves in here, typically as part of a deep reset.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:52.220]   Now, how does this connect to our discussion of the deep life and the systematic pursuit of the deep life?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.300]   The pursuit of a deep life will probably lead you to something like a deep reset.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.020]   A lot of people are coming to this more haphazardly.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.020]   It's Christopher McDougal moving to that bar and my friends moving to Colorado.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.180]   People are coming at this a little bit more haphazardly.
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.660]   We try to be more systematic about it here on the show.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:14.860]   But my point is, regardless of what we talk about here, I think deep resets are something we're going to see as a defining
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.740]   characteristic of the millennials in their 30s and early 40s.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.460]   And I, for one, think it's a positive trend.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:28.460]   I think it's a nuanced and sophisticated approach to thinking about life, the relationship between work and other elements of life.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.540]   I think our parents' generation struggled more with this.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.180]   We got more of this, oh, my God, what happened to the first half of my life?
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:44.020]   Let's buy a Corvette type reaction because this new generation had this long period of developing a work as a means to an end ethic.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.020]   They were ready for the disruption of the pandemic.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.780]   They were ready for the distress and wake up call of middle age.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:59.460]   So we have a bit of perfect storm of forces coming together to create a phenomenon that I think is going to be quite positive,
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:06.300]   actually, when we look back at it for for my particular cohort.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:14.740]   There you go, Jesse, I wrote an essay on the deep reset in my newsletter, so you can find it at Cal Newport dot com real early on in the pandemic,
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.980]   but it was way more sort of poetic and emotional.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:26.580]   So it was just feeling it's an interesting document to go back and read because it was projecting this feeling that was in the air of,
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.500]   I think changes are coming, people are going to make big changes, but it was clearly not really worked out yet.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:39.700]   And I think two years or whatever it's been now since then, two and a half years starting to see the shake out into something that's a little bit more clear, a little bit more systematic.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.260]   So, yeah, I'm a big fan of the deep reset.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.660]   I think a lot of people want to do this.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.620]   So hopefully having some terminology helps.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.820]   This will probably be a chapter in the next book, right?
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.900]   Yeah, I mean, the deep life book is all kind of about this.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.460]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.580]   In fact, the deep reset was one of the early titles for the book.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:06.380]   So it was going to be more prescriptive, like here's how to do a deep reset and then we change the deep life.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.860]   I'm not quite sure exactly how I'm going to tackle that book.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.900]   And I like that. Like I'm not I'm just letting ideas flow as I work on slow productivity and then a slow productivity finishes.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.980]   I'm going to laser lock and see like, what do I really want to do here?
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:28.940]   So with the definition, an intentional reconfiguration of one's life to amplify the small number of things that you've learned, is that to.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.500]   Benefit your work.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.380]   So when I say, OK, I have it up here, amplify the small number of things you've learned through experience that you value.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:46.140]   So what I'm trying to emphasize there is that the millennials are old enough now to have a experience based answer to the question of what's important to me.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.700]   Outside of work, outside of work, in work, in life in general.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:57.860]   Whereas I think if you're twenty three and you're trying to say what's important to me, you're basically making some guesses.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.660]   You don't really know. You haven't gone through the ups and downs.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.900]   You haven't gone through the various challenges.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:14.700]   So really, by the time you get to, let's say, thirty five, you're you're probably pretty well equipped to make a good deep reset because you have a pretty stable understanding at this point.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:20.420]   You're far enough along in your career that you know what works and what doesn't, what you like about work, what you don't.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.300]   You have leverage, you have career capital.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   So it's it's a it is kind of a critical age.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.220]   You'll have to get your friend Mr.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.740]   Money Mustache and tell him about your new term, Candlefire.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.980]   Yes, we should have Pete on.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.980]   I like him. Yeah.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.700]   Let's do that. I'll talk to him.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.380]   Yeah. Yeah. Be cool to see what he's.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:44.660]   So from what I understand, I was just talking to someone yesterday who's friends with him and some of the other fire characters.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.380]   A lot of them live in Longmont, Colorado.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.500]   It's probably building.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.660]   They're building. Yeah.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.180]   They have that co-working space there.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.300]   We should yeah, we should get an update on what's going on.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   And then tell him about your new term.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.300]   Candlefire. Yeah.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.140]   I don't know if that's going to stick.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.300]   There's a lot of fire terms, by the way, fat fire, light fire, thin fire.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.620]   Oh, man. OK, it's moving on.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.820]   We've got a great block of questions coming up.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.340]   I'm looking at them now.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.260]   Got some nuts and bolts about tasks.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.060]   We've got some stuff about metrics.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.540]   We got something about Facebook kids and video games.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.340]   We got something about, oh, a case study I'm particularly exciting about
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.540]   because it involves the melding of knitting.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.860]   And time blocking, you thought there was no connection, there is.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.700]   Before we get to all that, I want to talk briefly about one of the sponsors
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.660]   that makes this show possible, and that is eight sleep.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:47.540]   Now, the eight sleep pod is a a cover.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.020]   It's like a mattress pad cover.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.460]   You put it under your sheets and it hooks up to the eight sleep machine,
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.380]   and it allows you to control the temperature of your mattress.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.180]   I am a big believer of eight sleep.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.620]   I use eight sleep.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.540]   I want to give you an endorsement now that comes from my actual use of this product.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.460]   I am a big believer now.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.540]   And here's how I know I'm a big believer and not just a user is a true story.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.260]   This was probably two weeks ago now.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:21.980]   I'm in bed, you know, I'm trying to sleep and it doesn't feel right.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.100]   Like, I mean, I'm kind of uncomfortable.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.580]   I don't know about this.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.900]   And so I asked my wife, I was like, what's going on with with my eight sleep set up?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.500]   Because it's you can set each side differently.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.940]   So she gets the app out. It's on the phone. You can control it.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.380]   I had accidentally had my side turned off.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.740]   And I I know I'm an eight sleep zealot now because when that side
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.860]   of my mattress was actually turned off, I was unhappy.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.620]   I immediately noticed that I was immediately uncomfortable.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.540]   So I'm a big believer that this really is helping me sleep.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.820]   And so what is it like?
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.780]   Well, I'm a minus one.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   If you're an eight sleeper, you'll know there's a there's a minus five,
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.900]   the plus five scale. I'm a minus one on the scale.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.620]   So it's slightly cool.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.140]   It feels slightly cool when you lay down, which is nice, but not cold.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.700]   But the real magic of the eight sleep is not that, oh, I'm sleeping on something
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.660]   cold, is that all of these capillaries with all this liquid going through it,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.140]   pull the heat out of you that you're generating and get it out of your bed.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.300]   So it's less about it's making you cold than it is.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.620]   It's preventing you from getting hot.
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.380]   This is why I sleep better with this thing.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.380]   And I've become a big fan is because you never get hot throughout the whole night.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.580]   You feel like you feel when you first get into bed, you know, it's like a little bit
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.220]   cold. You haven't generated the body heat yet.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.700]   You get that all night long.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.500]   So I'm a big I'm a big believer of it.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.860]   I mean, they gave me a lot of notes here, but I'm just giving you my anecdote here,
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.500]   which is I 100 percent use this eight sleep pod.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.580]   I'm a fan of it.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.260]   So if you want some details, there's clinical data.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.020]   All right. 19 percent increase in recovery, 32 percent
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.820]   improvement, sleep quality, 34 percent more deep sleep.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.020]   I believe all of that.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.860]   They have a new generation of this, the pod three.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.180]   It tracks stuff. I don't really know how this works.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:01.860]   My wife shows me.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.780]   It'll tell you like how much you slept.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.100]   I guess there's sensors in the pad.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.580]   I don't know the futures now.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.100]   But let me tell you this.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.180]   If you're a hot sleeper, get the sleep pod.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:12.060]   You will sleep better. I use it every night.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.180]   So go to eight sleep dot com slash deep
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.260]   to save one hundred fifty dollars on the pod.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.180]   So remember, eight sleep dot com slash deep.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.980]   Don't forget the slash deep if you want to get that one hundred fifty dollar savings.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.620]   Eight Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.580]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.860]   Another product I want to quickly mention, because it is one that I use
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.900]   every single week, and that is our friends at Rhone.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.980]   R H O N E.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.620]   As I mentioned before, I've long been a fan of the Rhone
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.820]   moisture wicking exercise t shirts are very nice looking high quality,
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.380]   but do a really good job of keeping you cool.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.700]   This is why I was so excited to find that they now produce a dress shirt.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:07.620]   The commuter shirt from Rhone is a very nice looking button up shirt,
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.820]   but made with the same magic material as the other shirts I like from them.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.260]   It's cool. It's flexible.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.180]   It's moisture wicking and key.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.860]   It does not wrinkle.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.540]   I have a white Rhone commuter shirt, which I can wear with jeans.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.300]   It looks really nice.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.820]   I can wear with nicer pants and a jacket, and it looks really nice.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.380]   I use this when I have to speak in front of people
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.820]   because it's lightweight and it's flexible and you generate a lot of heat
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.980]   when you're up there speaking and you're not going to feel hot
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.540]   and you're not going to have sweat build up on your shirt.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.300]   So it looks great. You can wear it all day.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.100]   And with that magic fabric, Rhone does so well.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.460]   A couple of the things they've told me here,
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.260]   they call their odor free technology gold fusion.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.540]   So there's something in this magic fabric to make sure
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.620]   even if you're at it all day long, the shirt is not going to smell bad.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.740]   Also, let me just mention this. It's 100% machine washable.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.700]   You throw this thing in the washing machine, put it on a hanger to dry.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.460]   You don't have to go to the dry cleaner. Very convenient.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.540]   So I've long been a fan of Rhone, and I am now a fan of the Rhone commuter shirt.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.460]   So the commuter shirt can get you through any workday
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.980]   and straight into whatever comes next.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:24.820]   Head to Rhone.com/Cal and use the promo code Cal to save 20%
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.660]   off of your entire order.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:34.340]   That's 20% off your entire order when you head to R-H-O-N-E.com/Cal
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.460]   and then use the code Cal.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.940]   It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.780]   It's a good tagline corner office comfort.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.300]   Maybe one day we'll get a replacement for the famous blue shirt made by Rhone.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.140]   Yeah, it's a good idea.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.420]   It'd be a great shirt for podcasting because it gets I mean, it's hard.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.100]   We do like an hour and a half of just like rock and rolling in here.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.740]   You know, like it's not a.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.900]   You get hot.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.700]   Maybe I need a Rhone podcasting shirt.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.540]   Maybe we should get logos like you already have a TDL.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.700]   No, I mean like sponsor logos like NASCAR drivers all over.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   Oh, yeah. All over my shirt.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.060]   Yeah. Eat, sleep.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.580]   Could go across here.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.180]   I'm going to wear a visor that says Rhone across it.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:27.060]   And then for enough money, I'll also eat.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.980]   What's that magic spoon?
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.460]   Between.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.780]   Yeah, I'll tell you, if I've learned anything about audio and audio production,
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:39.340]   nothing pleases a listener more than a carefully
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.260]   mic sound of someone eating cereal.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.380]   Just
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.300]   would just
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.700]   be a wash in the list.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.420]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.020]   We got a good block here.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.180]   Jesse, what is our first question of the episode?
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.900]   OK, it's from Maria.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.580]   She says, I'm about to start a professorship and I'm thinking of applying
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.660]   the don't break the chain method to my research, for example,
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.700]   resolving to always do two or three hours every day.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.740]   Do you think this is a good solution?
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.500]   So for those who don't know, don't break the chain
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.380]   is a piece of productivity advice that's often attributed to Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.100]   It was his advice about joke writing.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.020]   Do it every day.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.980]   Have a calendar every day that you do it.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.100]   Mark that day with a big X.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.420]   And he says this is effective because you don't want to break the chain
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.180]   of day after day marked with the X's, which means even when it's hard
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.340]   or you don't feel like doing the work, you'll do the work
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.620]   because you don't want a blank spot on your calendar,
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.260]   a break in that chain of X's.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.460]   So does that apply for something like doing research as a professor?
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.980]   But we can think of other similar obligations for non academic positions,
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.340]   writing a book, maybe you're writing a book on the side while you have another job.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:02.780]   Maybe you need to do business strategy thinking even as you move into,
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.660]   I don't know, another type of more managerial role in your company,
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.780]   some sort of important, demanding work.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.180]   That requires the aggregation of a lot of time.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:16.180]   Well, my advice for Maria would be actually don't use that method.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.340]   I don't think you have a enough control,
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:26.060]   enough of the year as a professor to succeed with the don't break the chain method,
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.300]   and that's going to be frustrating.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.580]   I think this is true with a lot of higher in professional positions.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.500]   There's just going to be unavoidably periods and within those periods,
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.020]   days where your two hour or three hour research block or writing block
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.220]   or business strategy block can't occur.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.260]   I mean, I can look at my calendar right now and find these type of days pretty easily.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.420]   I think about this Friday.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.460]   That's Wednesday today, so two days from now,
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.740]   I have to go to campus relatively early.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.940]   I'm helping start up this new technology ethics major,
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.540]   and there's a fair and I'm actually going to be at the fair talking about this major.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.860]   And then I have a phone call and I got to get back in time to pick up my kids.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.420]   I'm looking at that day.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.020]   My normal writing is not going to happen.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.460]   My normal two to three hours of writing in the morning is not going to happen.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.260]   These type of days just happen.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.380]   We had another day like this coming up where there was
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.860]   a reporter was going to come at the same day that we were recording a podcast
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.780]   and the prep had to happen.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.020]   You do the math and the time disappears for writing.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.660]   This happens a lot.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.420]   So what I recommend for these type of jobs,
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.180]   when you have a lot of these uncertain demands on your time,
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.340]   much more so than a comedian has is instead
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.860]   rely on a season specific autopilot schedule.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:47.420]   So autopilot scheduling is a strategy we talk about often on this show.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.980]   It's where work, you know, has to happen on a regular basis.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.580]   You schedule to happen at the same times on the same days every week.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.580]   So you get in the habit.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.180]   It's Wednesday morning.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.500]   This is when I go do whatever work.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.300]   So when I say season specific autopilot schedule, you look at what you're
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.700]   in this case, semester, and if you don't have an academic job,
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.180]   quarter season looks like and you figure out an autopilot schedule
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.260]   that makes sense for that particular period of time.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.540]   So, Maria, you probably want to factor in your teaching schedule.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:22.260]   If on Monday and Wednesday you're teaching multiple classes,
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.620]   you might just say, look, I don't do research on those days,
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:30.340]   but on Tuesday and Thursday, I protect up to noon and I do a really big block.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.780]   And on Friday, I move my
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.220]   child care later and do from two to the five or five.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.460]   30 is another research block.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.620]   You're building a autopilot schedule.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.660]   This is when I do the work that is attuned to when the demands fall
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.420]   or don't fall in the particular upcoming season.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.260]   So that's what I would do.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:52.180]   Build an autopilot schedule for your research that makes sense for your semester.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.540]   Finding the times that are much less likely to get disrupted than others.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.220]   And then that's the chain you don't want to break is sticking to your autopilot
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.860]   schedule, not working every day.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.940]   I mean, in some sense, just think about that as one possible autopilot schedule
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.780]   that probably isn't going to work for your schedule.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:14.020]   All right, what do we have as question number two?
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.340]   OK, next question is from Kyle.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.700]   Do you have a task board and a weekly plan for your personal life?
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.500]   Yes and no.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.780]   So task board, yes.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.940]   So I keep my tasks, as I've talked about on Trello boards.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.340]   I have different boards for different roles.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.500]   I like the column.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:38.620]   Paradigm, because I can have tasks under different categories,
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.340]   different columns, you know, waiting to do back burner, waiting to hear back
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.420]   specific project specific, and I like the ability to attach
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.780]   file and information to the cards.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.220]   So one of my multiple Trello boards is labeled literally personal.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.820]   So, yes, I keep track of stuff that's non work related.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.020]   I don't want in my head.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.140]   So I have a task board for that.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   If you're a task list person, you can have a task list for it.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.820]   I do not, however, have a distinct weekly plan for my personal life.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.340]   I have one weekly plan for my week.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.780]   In that weekly plan, I talk about professional things I need to do
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.540]   in that weekly plan, I talk about relevant things to my personal life as well.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.220]   So I have one weekly plan.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.820]   And when I time block each day.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.540]   I'm usually time blocking the working hours in detail
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:28.060]   and then in that time block plan, have a less structured
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.820]   plan or strategy for the time after work.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.700]   So like, remember, tonight we got to do this.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.180]   I want to get a workout in.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.140]   Need to catch up on this reading.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.340]   So I can structure every minute of my evening.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.700]   But my daily time block plan is going to have notes for what's going to happen
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.900]   in in the evening ahead.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.740]   So I have a weekly plan that covers everything.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.940]   My time block schedule I make each day is going to have time blocks
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.060]   for the professional part of my day and notes for the personal part of my day.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.780]   So so that that gets handled.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.820]   I'm not winging it in my personal life.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.740]   The only thing that's different and what we've talked about before on the show
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.540]   is, again, I don't time block every minute of my personal life
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.660]   because then every minute of your life will be time blocked.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.900]   And that's too much.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.180]   So I'm a little bit more informal, a little bit looser
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.420]   with my personal scheduling, but it's the same ideas are applying
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.660]   to both parts of my life.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.020]   So then when you go to the task board, you just pull out
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.020]   some things and stick them in your weekly plan every week.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.220]   Yeah. Or daily.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.300]   So, you know, when I look at my
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.900]   task boards, when I'm doing my daily plan each day, I'll say, OK,
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.740]   what can I knock off from my personal list today?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.740]   Now, the nuance here is if there's a personal task
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.700]   I'm going to do during the work day.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.820]   Then it will be included in my time block schedule
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.580]   because I time block my work day. Right.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.900]   So I might say, hey,
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.580]   after lunch and before this phone call,
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.100]   I can do a 30 minute task block because that's a good time.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.460]   I can't really do anything else in 30 minutes.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.020]   And then I might list a few things there, you know, go mail this, go refill,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.660]   fill the car with gas.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.060]   So then personal things can make it into a time block plan
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.380]   if they're happening during the work day.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.380]   But if it's the evening, if it's like, OK, I need to remember to go,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.900]   you know, talk to talk to Julie about this and go pick some things up
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.260]   from the office, I'll just list them for the evening on my plan.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.220]   I won't necessarily say, oh, at six forty five, I'm going to go do this.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.940]   And then if you exercise, it's usually before or after work, right? Yeah.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:28.180]   Yeah, I usually do what I usually for me is like right after work
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:32.140]   or maybe like right before, right after I pick up like my kids from the bus stop.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.420]   And like that, that'll mark.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.460]   I mean, often like my plan will kind of go through there, like in by here
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.340]   to go get the kids from the bus stop, work out and then evening notes.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.420]   Mm hmm.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.180]   Yeah, we'll see tonight, however, I'm trying to
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.860]   I'm going to have to do a late night workout.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.940]   What time?
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.500]   Not late night, but after seven.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.820]   Because I'm going from here.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.020]   My oldest has a makeup baseball game.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.900]   It's going to start at five.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.380]   And by the time that's done, those things last two hours because kid pitch.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.820]   And so, you know, it's the first the first season, a kid pitch.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.340]   So there's a lot of walks.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.380]   So they usually takes up the full two hours that they that they allot to it.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.100]   So that's seven.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.460]   Yeah, I'll be like seven thirty.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.140]   Plus when I get home, but I don't want to break the chain on that.
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.140]   So I'll do a light workout.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.460]   Could just do like jump rope the whole time on the sideline.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.740]   I could just run around the field.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.340]   I'm going to bring weights. Yeah.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.140]   OK, that's all.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.220]   I'll be the dad who's doing concentration curls.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.540]   I always thought about that.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.100]   Like, I mean, there's a lot of tracks behind us.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.940]   Surprise, more parents don't do that.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.740]   My coach all the time.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.580]   I should. I'm just not a bad idea.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.460]   Yeah, not a bad idea.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.140]   You jump a ton of rope.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.980]   You jump a ton of rope. Yeah, I probably should.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.020]   I probably should.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.540]   Instead, I just kind of like chill with the other dads I know.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.580]   And we watch.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.500]   Yeah, I'm a baseball fan.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.220]   And even though it's nine year olds playing baseball, you get kind of into it.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.780]   Yeah. Well, you can still do that.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.180]   I mean, jump rope doesn't take that much space.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.860]   No, I mean, I'll bring the jump rope.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.220]   But you're saying not the not the dumbbells, not the concentration.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:06.940]   Well, you could, too.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.340]   I mean, you could still talk to them and do curls and they'd probably join in.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.340]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.180]   But not weird people out.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.540]   Don't mind me.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.860]   You don't if you don't polish the guns, you don't know if they're going to fire
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.500]   a lot of that, a lot of kissing on my biceps.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.540]   All right. What do we got next?
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.500]   All right. Next question is from Cam.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.220]   How do you track your metrics over the long term?
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.180]   Do you record them in a digital spreadsheet you can review throughout the year?
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:42.220]   I don't. Cam, I don't track my metrics long term, so I track them daily.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.060]   You know, I use my own time block planner.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.820]   Time block planner dot com that has a metric tracking space.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.700]   I do and I do daily tracking of my metrics.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:56.300]   When I do my weekly plan, I tend to sort of look over how things went.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:00.140]   And that kind of influences what goes into the week ahead.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.340]   So, for example, if I notice, hey, I'm not.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:06.380]   Doing this that often, like I'm supposed to be doing this every day,
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.060]   I'm looking at my metrics, I did it.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.900]   Then I might in my weekly plan for the next week have an extra reminder, like,
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.700]   hey, look, we're falling behind on this discipline.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.180]   Like you got to focus on that.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.220]   And then I'll see that every day when I look at my weekly plan.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.220]   It'll help keep me on track.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.500]   I don't really look at the metrics at any larger scale than that.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.300]   And it's not that I am ignoring that information or that I think
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.820]   that information is not important.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:33.820]   It's instead that I don't need to review it because humans are pretty good
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.500]   at integrating observations about their life.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.860]   If they're accurate observations, if they're observations on relevant things,
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.500]   we're pretty good at integrating that into a narrative about how things are going.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.300]   So when I get to, for example, my next semester plan,
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.020]   I have a pretty nuanced understanding of how things were going,
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:57.500]   that this aggressive metric I had for exercise was rarely being met,
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.100]   that this was going really well.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.660]   I remember that. I know that I've lived it every day.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.260]   I've written those metrics down every night.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.460]   I review them every week.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.860]   The information is there.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.500]   I have a gestalt of how my life is unfolding
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.860]   that I can then use to make future decisions.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.860]   I don't have to look at a spreadsheet
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.740]   and do some sort of analysis over the last 95 days
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.140]   and then to learn how my life went.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.420]   And I found this with a lot of of self-improvement or self-tracking
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.900]   is that more tech focused people
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:30.620]   have this big data paradigm that says insights are hidden in data
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.180]   until analysis extracts them.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.860]   This is the the defining idea of the big data revolution
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.300]   is that there is additional intelligence to be gained
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.060]   beyond what you have through your own experience.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.980]   Through data analysis, and this is true in many domains,
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.340]   I don't find it to be that useful for the domain of of self-improvement.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.940]   Now, if you're not tracking anything.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.660]   This information is essentially hidden to your brain.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.500]   But if you're tracking things every day and you're writing it down every day
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.460]   and maybe reviewing every week,
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.060]   those data points are being integrated by your brain.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.900]   It is adding them into a relatively sophisticated model of how things are going.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.020]   So I don't bother, Cam.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.340]   I think it's too fiddly to try to do tracking beyond that that level.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.060]   So that's my advice.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.300]   Track every day metrics that matters.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.860]   Look at them when you're doing a weekly plan that matters.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.260]   Beyond that, I think you're good.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:21.740]   I think you're good.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.500]   I don't need I don't think you need few additional tools
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.460]   to really gain bigger insights.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.180]   And this was big, Jesse, when we were
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.140]   Godwin was like the first decade of the 2000s, like when we were in our 20s.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.260]   The whole quantified self was like an offshoot of the productivity
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.740]   prong movement where it was we're going to quantify every element of our life
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.180]   and algorithmically, we will gain all these insights and,
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.340]   you know, become superhuman.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.260]   And the end, it was like a fun hobby to do all these tools
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.140]   and do all these tracking, but it didn't necessarily make a huge difference like.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.500]   Surfacing realities of your life and the numbers of metrics
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.660]   in the moment is very useful.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.180]   You know, how much weight did I lift?
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.060]   How much do I weigh today?
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.460]   Like that is very useful.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.580]   But finding higher order trends, I feel like our brains
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.220]   are really good at analyzing ourselves.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:20.260]   Well, a lot of people have those tracking, you know, instruments that they whether.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.420]   Yeah. But if you have like a Fitbit, for example, like say step tracking,
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.140]   what's really important there is that, you know, it's being tracked
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.820]   and you see each day how many steps you took.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.020]   Like that's the important information.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.820]   You don't necessarily need to see a graph of how these steps move.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.100]   You know, over time, you kind of know, like, am I hitting my goal?
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:39.020]   I haven't been. Now I am usually, you know,
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.340]   and I don't really need the graph over time.
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:45.300]   It's just the seeing that number every day, knowing that number is coming
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.700]   changes your relationship to movement.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:53.180]   I mean, obviously, there's places where data is important.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:57.620]   If you're weight training, you know, OK, here's where my numbers are.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.180]   And I want to try to push those up.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.460]   I mean, that could be important.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.940]   But also even there, people typically know,
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:08.340]   like I know where my bench has been and I think I'm ready to go for higher.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.540]   Like you don't necessarily have to see some chart of how things move over time.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.940]   So that's always been my my compromise position.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.740]   So I don't know the trends.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.140]   Yeah. Like quantification is important in the moment.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:24.060]   Complicated analysis of what was quantified is less important.
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.820]   I'm sure there's exceptions, though.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.580]   All right. Let us keep rolling.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:32.780]   Who do we have next?
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.140]   All right. Next question is from Allison, 30 year old lawyer.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.540]   This year, Facebook and Instagram have started flooding their users
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.340]   feeds with suggested posts from accounts they don't follow.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.740]   Many users are frustrated and angry about these changes.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.500]   What impact do you think these changes are going to have
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.660]   on the future of Facebook and Instagram?
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:54.260]   All right. Well, Allison, I've I've talked about this before,
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.020]   so I'll be short, but add a new twist to it.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.300]   But the source document to look at here
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.380]   is the article I wrote for The New Yorker on TikTok.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.420]   This probably came out.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.740]   God, I mean, this was the summer, early fall.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.140]   I don't know when that was, Jesse, but I'll look it up.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.060]   You look it up. OK.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.740]   Anyways, and I talked about it on the show, I believe at some point.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.860]   In fact, it was an article that came out of ideas we first introduced on the show.
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.500]   And basically, my premise was Facebook and Instagram
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.140]   following TikTok's lead.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.060]   To having more and more information selected algorithmically
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   and having no connection to people that you follow
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.620]   or to the things that people you follow share, and I said, ultimately,
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.700]   this is going to be the doom of those services.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.660]   So I'll briefly recapitulate my argument, why?
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.380]   The way I think about TikTok now, my shorthand for TikTok right now
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:51.740]   is that it's blues clues for adults.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.580]   So blues clues is a children's program
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.820]   that became really popular in the 1990s.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.500]   And I know about it because Malcolm Gladwell.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.980]   Wrote a chapter about blues clues in his seminal book, The Tipping Point.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:12.580]   And what he argued in The Tipping Point is compare blues clues to Sesame Street.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.220]   And you see something very different.
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.820]   I mean, Sesame Street is legible to adults.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:19.740]   You see what they're trying to do.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.820]   It's educational content.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.540]   It has these interesting puppets.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.820]   It's there's some in jokes for the adults.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.980]   It's funny. There's some good writing in it.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:32.060]   And so they're trying to help children learn.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.060]   And it's but it's a kind of an interestingly crafted thing.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.380]   You can have it on as a grown up and not hate it.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.700]   And it's a it's a well done show.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:43.100]   Blues clues, if you've ever seen this, baffles adults.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.300]   It's repetitive. It makes no sense.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.660]   They'll the characters will just look the camera and repeat themselves
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.820]   four or five times.
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.940]   They'll just they'll pause for a while.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.940]   It seems insipid.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.300]   It seems arbitrary.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.180]   It seems almost nihilistic in its incoherence.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.140]   And it was incredibly popular.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.980]   And what Malcolm Gladwell wrote about in The Tipping Point is
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.780]   what they did for that show was they basically studied kids.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:14.500]   And worked entirely off the metric of what grabs their attention and what doesn't.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:19.380]   And so they built a whole TV show around just the simple goal
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.620]   of how do I keep kids attention on here?
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.580]   And the result was this incoherent to adults
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.820]   audio visual assault mishmash.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.180]   And there was actually a lot of this that arose in the 90s.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.220]   Barney's gave way to Teletubbies.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.380]   These shows that were so weird to adults.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.020]   Sesame Street was funny.
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.540]   And be like, hey, here comes, you know,
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.460]   Stalker Channing is going to come on and do a skit with garbage.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.100]   Whatever his name was, Oscar the Grouch.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.060]   And it's about letters.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.980]   And it's also kind of funny.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.420]   And there's some good writing is kind of winking at the audience.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.940]   And then it's Teletubbies.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.340]   Your eyes are melting.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.860]   It's Blue's Clues like what's going on?
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:59.780]   Why is it just staring at the screen, waiting for the kids to repeat a word
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:00.140]   or whatever?
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.700]   And it's because it was engineered to a simple metric.
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.260]   What's going to keep kids looking?
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.380]   In the world of social media.
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.300]   Facebook and Instagram is Sesame Street.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.300]   TikTok is Blue's Clues.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.860]   They got rid of any of the potentially good stuff,
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.660]   the connection to other people, the scene, what people, you know,
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:22.740]   are up to the the expression, the discovery of interesting things
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.260]   and made it just what gets your eyes.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.740]   A fix to this as long as possible.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:33.900]   And the the result is this format that, again, to a non-TikTok user is incoherent.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.540]   Is mind melting, is these weird short videos with cuts and movements?
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.900]   And all it is is Blue's Clues.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.980]   It is what happens when you push a content
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:47.580]   to its logical extreme in the context of attention maximization.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:52.580]   And so just like adults looked at Blue's Clues like this feels just
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.500]   I think a lot of adults look at TikTok like this.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.540]   We're not even pretending anymore.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.900]   That this is unlocking the power of the web.
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.740]   It's just the logical terminal space of when you're saying,
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.660]   let's just maximize eyes, eyes, eyes.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.660]   OK, so TikTok is Blue's Clues for adult.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.740]   If Facebook and Instagram follow that path.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.700]   They're getting rid of all the stuff that's quality.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.100]   They're getting rid of all the potential value proposition
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.580]   of connecting the people, you know, discovering things from people like you.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.780]   And it just becomes what's going to keep my toddler
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.140]   slack jawed at the screen while I'm trying to get something done.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:30.140]   Once they move into that arena, they have lost their main competitive advantage,
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.540]   which is their social graphs.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.300]   As I argued in that New Yorker piece, it is too hard at this point
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.940]   to build a social graph of the same size and of the same value
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.140]   as a Twitter, Instagram or Facebook.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:45.380]   So any surface whose service that's mainly based on one of those social graphs
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.500]   is not going to compete with those.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.500]   But as soon as they move away from their social graph, here's friends and links.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.980]   And just to algorithmically select the content,
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.020]   they're just in the competitive mosh pit with everything else
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.740]   is trying to grab your attention.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:01.100]   And Blue's Clues isn't on TV anymore because there's other cartoons
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.220]   that came along or even more insipid and even more attention capturing.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.500]   So that's why I think, Alison, the move of Facebook and Instagram
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.740]   towards a Blue's Clues TikTok model
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.500]   maybe is trying to stave off some user
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   user loss in the short term, but is going to expose them
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.980]   the competition that they can't hope to win at long term
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.340]   when they left the advantage of their social graph.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.740]   They left their protection.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.780]   And I think that's going to be the end of them, ultimately of them
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.580]   as some sort of giant culture shaping monopolistic platform that everyone uses.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.780]   Your article came out July 28th.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.900]   July 28th. OK, so that's the TikTok. What's it called?
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:43.060]   Let me pull it up one more time.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.540]   July 28th.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.380]   TikTok and the fall of social media giants.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.100]   TikTok in the fall, the social media giants. All right. So.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.500]   You'll hear more about their. All right, let's do a call.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.460]   Sounds good.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.460]   Hi, Cal. My name is John, and my job for this question is being a father.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:07.220]   I have four kids ages nine, seven, four and 10 months old.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:10.340]   The question I have is regarding the productivity of children.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:14.140]   We are an unschooling family, a form of homeschooling, and therefore
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:17.140]   video games do not interfere with school hours or homework.
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.780]   I know you are against social media, but I am curious
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:24.180]   what your thoughts are on video game benefits and problems in general.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:28.020]   My wife and I originally decided to keep screens from our kids.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.380]   Our oldest didn't use screens until she was five.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.380]   Strangely enough, after allowing screen use, her emotional expression,
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.340]   previously very cool, suddenly warmed up.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:39.420]   She began to dance and sing and talk about her feelings
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.140]   more than she had in the last five years.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.620]   After reading several articles and books, including several by Jane McGonigal
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.140]   and multiple articles by Dr.
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:49.660]   Peter Gray, we decided to let our children use screens.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.860]   We've gone back and forth over the last few years,
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:55.420]   sometimes letting them use screens as much as they wish,
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.380]   and limiting their use or banning them completely.
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.460]   They're not using social media and we're not planning to let them anytime soon.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.500]   Though each child is different,
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.940]   what are your general thoughts on video games for children?
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.060]   Are they a useful learning tool, as Dr.
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.260]   Gray would argue?
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.060]   Do they teach skills quickly, as Jane McGonigal has stated?
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.460]   Are there benefits that are difficult to comprehend,
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.460]   or do they interfere with children's development
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.140]   as well as depleting the dopamine in children's brains?
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.260]   Or I could restate that in a less negative way and ask if they simply take up time
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.580]   that would be better spent elsewhere.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.180]   Many gamers are successful in many different industries,
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.460]   and many gamers are seemingly addicted
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.860]   and cannot function in a healthy way in the real world.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:39.100]   There are surely hidden benefits and hidden dangers
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.060]   we're still learning about.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.260]   There are definitely two strong opposing views when it comes to gaming,
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.500]   especially in children, and I would love to hear your views.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.540]   Well, all right, John, there's a lot going on in that question.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.100]   We're talking about video games, we're talking about social media,
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.740]   we're talking about screens and trying to navigate all of that with kids.
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.860]   My three kids are the same age of your three older kids,
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.980]   so all this is familiar, all this is relevant.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.540]   There's a narrow path, a complicated path to try to navigate here.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:13.100]   I'll tell you where I currently stand based on what I've seen and read,
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.140]   that this is a tentative proposal.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.340]   This can change over time.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.660]   All right, so video games.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.540]   There, I believe the danger is multiplayer online games,
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.860]   massively multiplayer online games.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.100]   This could be things like Roblox, this could be things like Fortnite,
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.460]   this could be things like World of Warcraft.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.340]   Those I would steer clear of.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:41.380]   These massively online games are the primary vectors of addictive behavior.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.900]   They're massively time consuming,
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.580]   especially with things like World of Warcraft.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.460]   They play with your brain in a way that can be very discouraging.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.620]   In fact, some of the strongest examples of digital addictions
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:02:00.220]   that exist over all digital technologies come from massively online video games.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:04.700]   So no multiplayer, single player video games.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.100]   Playing Minecraft, I'm playing the new Legends of Zelda on a Switch,
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.740]   I'm playing Mario Party or whatever.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.700]   I don't think that's inherently bad.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.100]   And I think it's fine for kids that have video games,
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.700]   have access to play them, the time should be controlled.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.180]   This is when you get to play them.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.940]   It's not a default. It's not every day.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.580]   But you can do an hour here, hour there.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.260]   It's a completely fine activity.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.380]   I think modern video games are beautiful, they're fun.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.140]   And as long as it's not a default activity,
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:36.780]   something the kids can just do whenever they want in their room, why not?
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.940]   Now, the final thing I'll say about video games is,
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.820]   no, I don't fully buy McGonagall's argument.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.020]   I'm saying McGonagall like from Harry Potter.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.420]   It's I know exactly who you're talking about, the gamification.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:52.220]   McGonagall, I believe, which is different to Harry Potter.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.500]   That'd be interesting if--
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:58.060]   It's the-- she does research with the chimpanzees and stuff, right?
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.660]   So she does like the gamification of life work.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.460]   Are we thinking about the--
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.940]   I'm thinking of Jane Goodall.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.060]   You're thinking of Goodall.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.220]   Yeah, if Jane Goodall wrote a book about video games,
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.020]   it'd be interesting.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.380]   If Professor McGonagall from Harry Potter wrote a book on video games,
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.460]   that I would read.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:21.100]   I don't fully buy McGonagall's view of this being beneficial.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.540]   Stephen Johnson wrote a book like this in the early 2000s,
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.700]   Everything Bad is Good for You.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.860]   And it was trying to make the argument of you're
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.620]   going to get great hand-eye coordination.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:34.020]   OK, I mean, sure.
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.220]   So I know I'm not like, oh, this is-- these games are giving you
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.260]   these secret life skills.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:42.060]   I also don't think single-player video game playing
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.100]   or in-person multiplayer, so three, two people in the same room,
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.660]   I have no problem with that.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.140]   I think of it as like TV.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.020]   It's like, how much do you want your kids to watch TV?
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.620]   Some, not all the time.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.900]   So you meter out that time.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.820]   What about other types of screens?
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:01.820]   YouTube, I would treat like television.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.060]   So YouTube is another danger.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.820]   If YouTube is just something that the kids, especially a 9-year-old
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.260]   or a 7-year-old or even like an 11 or 12-year-old,
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.060]   if it's something that kids just have unrestricted access to,
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.740]   so it's like their video game time, they can just be on YouTube.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.700]   That's hard for their developing brain.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.300]   It can bring them into weird places via the recommendation algorithm.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.500]   Also, the content, it can get kind of weird there, right?
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.100]   This sort of just playing at what the algorithm likes
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.740]   can bring you to sort of weird places.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.780]   So I think YouTube should be thought of as like a TV channel.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.180]   Oh, we're going to watch TV now.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:39.100]   There are certain channels that we know about as parents that we say,
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:39.980]   yeah, let's go watch.
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:42.220]   You can watch some videos of that or we'll put some of those videos on.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.180]   I mean, that's how we handle it in our household.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.020]   There are certain channels we know about that we're like, OK,
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.940]   if you want to put on one of those videos instead of watching a show
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.340]   during TV time, that's fine.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.580]   So if you want to play like a Mark Rober video.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.860]   Fine, go ahead, if you want to watch like, you know, Adam Savage,
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.740]   we'll allow Mr. Beast.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.540]   They like, well, I'm like a Mr. Beast or so.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.780]   Those are kind of, they're fine, right?
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.220]   Yeah. So YouTube, though, think about it like TV.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:13.020]   You don't let the kids of that age have a TV in their room and you say,
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:13.900]   hey, just rock and roll.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.740]   We don't know what you're up to.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.980]   You're like, yeah, you can have TV time, but we want to know what you're watching.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.460]   So treat YouTube like TV where you have a say
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.980]   and complete visibility on what they're watching.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:27.060]   Do not let YouTube rabbit hole falling be something that you allow your kids
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.940]   to do at a young age.
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.460]   Social media.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:35.860]   At least 16, at least, I mean, no earlier than that,
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:39.740]   especially with if you have girls, the data there, I just believe
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.820]   is very, very worrisome.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.740]   Unrestricted Internet access on a phone.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.180]   So like a smartphone with unrestricted Internet access.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.460]   I think that needs to be late high school at the earliest.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.860]   People think that's wildly unrealistic.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.660]   I think people are wildly wrong about that.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.020]   I it's just not good.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.580]   Half of the kids are going to give a smartphone to at 14
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580]   are going to have problems with it.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.900]   And so I'm just a believer, you can have a dumb phone,
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.020]   you can text your friends and text you when you need to get picked up.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:08.260]   If that's taking you out of some social stuff, then let's make sure
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.900]   that you're involved in at least one or two groups or activities,
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.900]   be it a sport or theater or a robotics team that is a team of people
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.740]   you really like and you're really involved in and you have ways
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.140]   to connect to people that don't require you to be involved in like Tik
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.100]   Tok or something like this.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.460]   But I am just a believer.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.420]   Smartphones and a 15 year old smartphones and a 14 year old.
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.460]   It's no bueno.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.380]   It doesn't lead anywhere good.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.580]   So that's where I fall now.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.060]   No massively online video games.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.540]   YouTube is treated like a TV channel.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.900]   It's only done where you are around and you control what they're watching.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.980]   Single player video games are fine.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.660]   Just control the time like you would TV watching social media
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.340]   or unrestricted smartphone access really has to come as late
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.460]   as you can possibly push it, even if they say, you know,
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.020]   we won't have any friends and everyone else is doing it.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.780]   Teenagers have been saying that ever since there were teenagers.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:56.940]   Yeah, it works.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.460]   Our video games are so primitive, Jesse.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.700]   Yeah, my kids were playing it the other day.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:06.220]   Their friend has a Nintendo Switch and they got 64 classic
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.500]   8-bit NES games on it, and they're not impressed.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.140]   They're not impressed.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.860]   I don't know if you've seen these modern video games.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.300]   My son plays Legends of Zelda something, something.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.860]   I don't know some Switch game.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.460]   It's a it's a beautiful world.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.380]   It's done in like a it's not photorealistic.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.580]   It's almost like it's a hand drawn.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.300]   Yeah. And it's a you just explore this world and go on adventures.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.460]   And it looks better than like most TV shows look.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.420]   Ten years ago. Mm hmm.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.380]   So I was like, all right, you can do an hour of that.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.540]   But they have no yeah.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.580]   He's when they see the Super Mario Brothers like, come on.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.060]   Yeah. What is this thing?
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:46.020]   All right, let's do a
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.060]   little case out here, let's do one more question
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.420]   and then I have a cool case study I want to read.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.700]   Sounds good.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.540]   This question is from Adam, a 40 year old,
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:58.300]   40 year old from New York.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.100]   Can you describe your decision rule for entering a task
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.620]   either onto a travel board versus directly into a weekly pant?
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.740]   I'm finding it tempting, easier to put time sensitive items
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.660]   and links directly into my weekly plan, but then it gets a little cluttered.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.380]   Well, Adam, I'll tell you my best practice on this issue,
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.940]   which is not something I always follow, but I'm always happier when I do.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.580]   And that best practice is the following.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.660]   So you have, you know, something pops up, a task, an obligation,
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.780]   you jot it down and your whatever you use for capture in the moment.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.660]   So for me, it'll probably be my time block planner
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.660]   on the daily pages, there's a section for capturing these things.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.860]   And then you get to the end of the day, you need to process it.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:43.260]   My best practice is there's two places where that new task can go.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.340]   Onto an appropriate task order list or onto your calendar.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.140]   All right, so task order list onto your calendar.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.460]   What would qualify it for going onto your calendar
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.980]   if it's connected to a specific day in which you've decided
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.700]   it needs to be executed?
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.780]   So the calendar is for time specific tasks.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.340]   So let's say I need to do a book blurb and it's due on Thursday.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.580]   I might put an all day event on that calendar day.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.540]   You know, book blurb is due for whatever.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:15.140]   Oftentimes, I'll actually find the specific time
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.860]   for one of these time sensitive activities and put it on my calendar
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.740]   like an appointment.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.780]   Give you a real world example.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:26.100]   Friday of this week, department merit reviews are due.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.140]   It's a administrative task where you have to go through a spreadsheet
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.340]   and sort of fill in all the academic activities you did during the year.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:36.020]   And it helps generate your raise for the year.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.300]   I have the specific time when I'm gonna do that
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.620]   on my calendar for Friday.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.340]   So if a task is associated with a particular day,
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.180]   it can go on your calendar.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.540]   It doesn't have to be on your task list
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.460]   because your calendar is obviously a productivity tool
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.740]   that you trust when you get to each day,
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.700]   you see what your appointments are and you do those things.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.380]   So I trust my calendar as a productivity tool.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:57.820]   If it's not tied to a specific day, it goes to a task list.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.220]   In my case, those lists are kept on Trello boards.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.340]   Now I look at my Trello boards each morning
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.020]   when I build my daily time block plan.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.700]   So if you're actually following the system,
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.900]   if I actually am in the groove of looking at my task board
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.780]   every day when I do my weekly plan,
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.340]   I can trust that stuff that's important will get done
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.100]   because when I look at the relevant task board,
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.260]   I'll see those tasks and I'm not gonna be dumber tomorrow
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.100]   than I am today.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.980]   So if I know today, this thing is important,
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.100]   when I see it tomorrow, I will remember,
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.220]   oh, this is important and see if I can fit it
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.260]   into my time block plan for the day.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.980]   So that is my best practice.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.260]   I sometimes don't follow it when I feel like my schedule
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:37.540]   is disrupted enough that I don't trust myself
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.740]   to look at my task list every day.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.820]   And that's when I begin adding an extra reminder
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.580]   to my weekly plan, emailing myself an email
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.460]   where it's a reminder in the subject line.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:51.460]   But that is all a, that's all an artifact of lack of trust.
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.660]   I don't trust that I'm gonna see this in my list
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.220]   and make sure it gets done.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.100]   That makes me nervous.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.500]   So I'm gonna add these extra reminders.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.500]   But when I am on track, executing my system properly,
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.780]   that's how I like to do it.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.980]   If it needs to be done a particular day,
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.220]   put it on that day, otherwise put on the list.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.260]   Even if I know it needs to get done this week,
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.460]   I don't really need to write that down somewhere
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.740]   because when I see that task in my list every single morning,
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:18.180]   I will remember this is something
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.300]   that needs to get done this week.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.220]   Like I'm not gonna forget tomorrow what I know today.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.460]   So that's my best practice, calendar or task list,
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.940]   check the task list every day.
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:28.500]   That moves smoothly.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.540]   And that's how I know that I'm out of sorts by the way,
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.180]   is when I start emailing myself reminders,
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:35.460]   that's when I step back and say, I'm off my system.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.780]   I need to get back to my system.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.580]   And I always feel better when I do.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.980]   - Do you do that process in like the same spot every day
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.300]   or is it very?
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.140]   - I do now.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.020]   So in my study at home,
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.340]   which we'll have to in an upcoming weekly update video,
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.740]   Jason's gonna bring the camera over to my study at home.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.540]   I go to my study at home each morning
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:58.340]   and I have a desk, my custom built desk
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.940]   that's made to fit the kind of weird space of the study.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.660]   And it has a one drawer.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.340]   I had it built in this one drawer.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.980]   And I open up that drawer and here's my time block planner.
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.820]   I take that out, I put it on the desk,
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.620]   I turn on my laptop.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.820]   And it's the first thing I do
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.300]   is I'll make that daily plan for the day.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.540]   And I try to do this if I can
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.220]   before I walk my kids to the bus stop.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:22.100]   If not, immediately after I get back from the bus stop,
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.180]   I'll do this, but I load up my computer.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.940]   And so my weekly plan will be,
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.980]   and I was looking to see if I,
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.220]   I don't have my backpack in here.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:34.300]   My weekly plan will be printed and in my time block planner.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.700]   So I open this thing, I read the weekly plan,
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:41.140]   I open my computer, I read my calendar,
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.340]   I read my task list in Trello
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.820]   and sketch out that time block plan for the day.
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.740]   So when I'm on the ball, that's what I do.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.260]   And so having this set location
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.900]   that I come to every morning at the same time to do this,
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.380]   that really has helped keep me in it.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.980]   So during the period when we were renovating that study
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.500]   and I didn't have a set location, I might work outside,
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.860]   I might work at the kitchen table, I might work upstairs.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.220]   I fell off the system more.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.100]   And so it's a good question.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.320]   Having a great location where this is where I do,
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.180]   that's how I start my day
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.140]   has really made a big difference to me.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.820]   So we'll get that, we'll do a weekly update video.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.060]   I'll show you that whole setup sometime soon.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.740]   I wanna do a quick case study here.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.660]   One of the things I like when people send in
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.460]   in the question survey, which by the way,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.300]   Jesse, make sure that link is in the show notes,
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.580]   but to submit questions or case studies,
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.240]   you have to go to a SurveyMonkey survey and enter it.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.580]   And that link is right in the show notes.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.300]   Here's a case study that someone sent in.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.500]   This came from Anna,
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:46.060]   who was an anthropologist in her mid forties.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.560]   All right, so here's what Anna says.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.040]   In January, 2021,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.260]   I started to document my time for each day
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.160]   in a knitted scarf.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.420]   I broke up each day into how much time I spent writing
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:02.460]   emails, grant proposals, teaching documents, social media,
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.060]   admin and research related writing.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:10.060]   And I knitted a proportional number of rows in my scarf
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:13.480]   using different colors for each of these activities.
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.180]   My days used to be all over the place.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.680]   Then I started listening to your podcast in June of 2021
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.780]   and really put some of your systems into place,
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:23.400]   time blocking, getting off Twitter and Instagram,
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.060]   working out, working on my values and priorities, et cetera.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.320]   So she saw in her scarf,
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.160]   the social media stitches disappeared.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.480]   There were fewer email stitches and the research
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.880]   and proposal writing stitches lengthened
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.360]   as the scarf grew through the end of the year.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.760]   The result of this shift was research papers got submitted,
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   two books got completed and a grant of almost
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.620]   5 million euros got submitted
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.980]   and went through to the final round.
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:54.200]   The scarf is both knitted data
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.620]   of the effects of your deep work interventions,
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.340]   as well as a relaxing way to unwind.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.960]   So thanks for sharing with us all your systems
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.700]   and inspiring us to find more time for the things
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:03.620]   we enjoy about our work.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.600]   Keep it coming and I will continue to listen to you
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.840]   as I knit.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.200]   I thought that was really cool.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.640]   So she elaborated,
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.760]   let's basically at the end of the day
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.600]   is when she would do this.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.380]   She would look at how she spent her time for the day
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.880]   and that would be her pattern
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.840]   for the knitting she did in the evening.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:25.600]   And so the scarf is a colorful like data visualization
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.480]   of not only how she spent her time,
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.680]   but how that shifted after she got into
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.220]   the Deep Questions podcast.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:35.120]   So I sent her a note and I said, we need a picture.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:35.960]   So that's coming.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.520]   She's gonna send us a picture of the scarf.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.560]   I'm kind of excited about that.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.280]   So Jesse, we'll put that on the show.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.120]   - Yeah.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:41.940]   - We'll put that on the show and get that.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.880]   I love that idea of knitting a record of your time
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.320]   and the idea of having a relaxing activity you do
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.560]   at the end of each day to help reset your mind
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.920]   as sort of a good shutdown ritual activity.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.560]   So Anna, thanks for that.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.640]   I look forward to seeing a picture of the scarf
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.540]   and keep knitting.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:05.300]   All right, so coming up, we have the mailbag segment.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.720]   Look at some stuff that people have sent
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.700]   to my interesting@calnewport.com address recently
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.560]   that have caught my attention.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.760]   First, I wanna briefly mention our good friends at Ladder.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:22.280]   Ladder is a place to get insurance.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.840]   Now, if you're anything like me,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.800]   you probably put off things like getting insurance
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.540]   until the last minute.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.200]   But when it comes to something like life insurance,
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.280]   you can't really afford to delay.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.980]   If something happens to you,
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.720]   it is not gonna be something you're expecting.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.000]   If God forbid, you leave this earth
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.400]   a little bit earlier than planned,
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.640]   those that you love, those that you care for
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.240]   will be left in the lurch unless you have life insurance.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.360]   So you need life insurance,
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.600]   but you probably, if you don't have it,
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.080]   it's because it's complicated.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:53.920]   How do I do this?
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.960]   I'm gonna tell you how to do it.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.360]   Go to Ladder.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.680]   Ladder is 100% digital, no doctors, no needles,
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.500]   no paperwork.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.960]   When you apply for three million,
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.240]   no doctors, needles, or paperwork
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.440]   when you apply for $3 million in coverage or less,
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.580]   I should say, you just answer a few questions
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.520]   about your health in an application.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.480]   They then come back and give you quotes
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.840]   that you can evaluate right there.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.040]   No hidden fees, cancel any time, get a full refund
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.280]   if you change your mind in the first 30 days.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.960]   All these policies are issued by insurers
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.540]   with long proven histories of paying claims.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.160]   They're rated A and A+ by AM Best.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.720]   So if you need life insurance, just do this right now.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   Go to ladderlife.com/deep,
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.000]   and you can put in your information
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.440]   and instantly discover if you're approved
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.740]   and how much it's gonna cost.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:46.140]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep,
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.340]   ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.180]   So if you have a family
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.140]   and you don't have enough life insurance,
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.440]   just go do that right now.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.960]   Put that on your to-do list, do it,
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.060]   and then get on with the rest of your day.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:03.820]   Also wanna talk about our friends at stamps.com.
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.220]   The holiday season is coming up.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.940]   I'm already stressed even just imagining
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.200]   waiting in the interminable lines
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.540]   at the Tacoma Park Post Office.
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:16.700]   It's right down the street from us here at our Deep Work HQ.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:21.700]   This is why I am happy that stamps.com exist.
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.880]   Stamps.com is your one-stop shop
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.820]   for all your shipping and mailing needs.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.020]   For more than 20 years,
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.620]   stamps.com has been indispensable
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.520]   for over 1 million businesses.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.240]   It allows you access to the USPS and UPS services you need
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.800]   right from your computer,
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.280]   no need to go to the post office.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.160]   It also gives you major discounts on shipping rates.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.720]   So you can use stamps.com to print postage
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.040]   wherever you do your business.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.360]   All you need is a computer and a printer.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.480]   If you need a package pickup,
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.760]   you schedule it right there through the stamps.com dashboard.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.900]   You print the postage right on your home computer.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.120]   You just tape it right on there.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.140]   It's the way to do all of your mailing needs
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.640]   without having to go to the post office.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.560]   This is useful even if you're doing a small amount
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.600]   of mailing your company or running a big online business
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.000]   that sends a lot, stamps.com is what you need.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.040]   So this holiday season, trade late nights for silent nights
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.000]   and get started with stamps.com today.

[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.260]   Just go to stamps.com, click the microphone
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.440]   at the top of the page and enter the code DEEP
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.640]   to get those special offers.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.700]   All right, final segment of the show
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.980]   is the mail bag segment.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:49.200]   So for over a decade now,
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.500]   I've maintained this email address,
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.520]   interesting@calnewport.com,
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.240]   where I've solicited my readers and listeners
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.880]   to send me interesting things they think I might like.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.400]   I feel bad that there's so much cool stuff that comes in,
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.480]   so much more than I have time to actually write about
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.960]   or turn into articles or book chapters.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.420]   So we introduced this segment so we could walk through
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.840]   a selection of some of the cooler things
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.440]   that have come into my interesting inbox in recent weeks.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.000]   All right, let's get started with item number one.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.160]   Now, again, if you're watching this on YouTube,
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.960]   you will see what I'm talking about.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.760]   If you're listening to this,
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.920]   links to everything I'm talking about are in the show notes.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.280]   And the first thing I wanna talk about
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.820]   was sent to me by Chris,
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:35.220]   and it has to do with augmented reality.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.400]   So on this show, I had made this prediction
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.840]   that the major upcoming technology revolution
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.280]   that not enough people are talking about
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.280]   is gonna be the elimination of physical screens in our life.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.640]   Augmented reality tools are going to put digital screens
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.480]   into our world.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.400]   The computation behind what we're seeing on the screens
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.520]   is gonna happen in the cloud.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.240]   The entire consumer electronics industry as we know it
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.240]   is going to be drastically reduced.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   We don't need laptops, phones, televisions, desktops.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.720]   When all of that can be done
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.760]   with a single augmented reality device,
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.380]   you're gonna have a small number of companies
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.800]   become more valuable than anything in the history,
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.760]   probably, of the economy,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.440]   and huge companies go out of business.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.120]   All right, so Chris sent me an example from Twitter.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.400]   So this is a screenshot from a video that was on Twitter
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.160]   of some of the next steps towards this reality coming true.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.680]   So if you're looking at this online, watching the video,
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.780]   the picture you'll see on the screen is of a laptop,
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.480]   but surrounding the laptop
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.000]   is three very large monitor screens.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.320]   And this is all in a sort of standard office environment
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.860]   with fluorescent lights or what have you.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.880]   In this scene, those giant monitor screens
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.480]   do not exist in the real world.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:00.240]   They're added there through augmented reality.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.280]   Now, what this is is a demo of the new Oculus product,
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.680]   the Quest 2 Pro.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:10.560]   And this is a early form of augmented reality,
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.960]   which is not directly adding these screens
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.440]   into your field of vision
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.080]   in the way that a Microsoft HoloLens
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.680]   or a Magic Leap goggle would do.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.080]   This is actually using the Quest 2's
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.200]   pass-through, real-time pass-through camera feature.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.220]   So actually the user here
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.320]   has a full virtual reality helmet on.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.040]   There's a camera in front of this virtual reality helmet.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.680]   They are seeing what's in front of them
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.280]   filmed by this camera.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.960]   So there's a helmet that's blocking their view
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.800]   of what's in front of them,
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.000]   but the camera is showing what's in front of them
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.240]   virtually on the virtual reality screen.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.160]   So it's as if they're not wearing the helmet itself.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.280]   And then the Quest is adding these virtual screens
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.460]   onto that real-time video feed.
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:59.360]   This of course is not practical, right?
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.200]   We're not in the office or walking around
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.720]   gonna put on a full virtual reality helmet
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.200]   when we wanna add screens to the world around us.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.560]   But as Margaret Zuckerberg has explained
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.840]   in recent interviews,
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.660]   there is a lot of logic behind what they're doing here.
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.420]   It is much, much easier to add virtual elements
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:19.280]   to a video stream than to actually literally add them
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.360]   using a wave guide into what you're seeing right now
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.560]   through transparent glasses.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.700]   So they're mastering this technology
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.480]   in this much easier context
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.520]   of their virtual reality helmets,
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.320]   but their goal, and he's very clear about this,
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.400]   is to move from this into actual glasses
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.600]   where these elements are being added to what you see.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.920]   So you're seeing the world
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:40.320]   and these are being added to what you see.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.760]   Facebook has a big collaboration with Ray-Ban right now
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.040]   as they're working on the physical form of these glasses.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.460]   So don't sleep on what Zuckerberg is up to over there.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.120]   They talk a lot about the metaverse,
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.320]   but this is where the real money is gonna be.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.160]   And he knows it, and I think the strategy
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.020]   of using virtual reality as a way
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:59.140]   to master augmented reality
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.760]   while waiting for the augmented reality hardware
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.560]   to get viably usable by most people
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.120]   is a smart strategy that will probably give them a leg up.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.600]   So as this picture captures, that future is coming.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:18.440]   All right, item number two, let me switch over.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:19.880]   This comes from Sten.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.600]   So we talk a lot on the show,
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.840]   like with the Bram Stoker piece from a couple of weeks ago,
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.020]   about the impact of environment on cognition.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.320]   Environment can affect your cognition.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.880]   This is why we shouldn't be so casual, for example,
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.400]   about just saying, "Hey, everyone, work from home now."
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.000]   You're like, "Great, my laptop technically has access
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.600]   to all the features I have at work,
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.200]   and so I can just sit in the laundry room
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.960]   or at my kitchen table and do my job."
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.680]   It's not so simple.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.800]   Environment matters, setting matters.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.400]   It's why my "New Yorker" piece from 2021
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.320]   about work from near home,
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.120]   I talked about all of these writers
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.640]   who technically were working from home,
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.080]   but found really eccentric locations near their home
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.760]   to actually do their work, because setting matters.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:08.000]   So Sten showed me, or what he sent me here
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.520]   was an article by Andrew Huberman,
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.560]   Stanford neuroscientist, Andrew Huberman,
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.960]   who's often cited on this show.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   He wrote an article that included a short paragraph
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.000]   on the cathedral effect, which is a scientific notion
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.020]   that captures some of what I'm talking about
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.280]   with setting affecting cognition.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.800]   Gonna read here part of this excerpt,
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.000]   which I have up on the screen.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.100]   So here's from Andrew.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:38.260]   There is an interesting effect of workplace optimization
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.480]   called the cathedral effect,
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.720]   in which thinking becomes smaller,
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.220]   more focused on analytic processing,
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.200]   when we are in small visual fields.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.320]   The opposite is also true.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.320]   In short, working in high ceiling spaces
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.260]   elicits abstract thoughts and creativity,
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.080]   whereas working in low ceiling spaces promotes detailed work.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.720]   Even relatively small differences,
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.840]   like a two foot discrepancy in ceiling height
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.520]   have been shown to elicit such differences.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.120]   The takeaway, consider using different rooms,
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.720]   or buildings, indoors and outdoors
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.060]   to help access specific brain states
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.480]   and the types of work they favor.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.320]   Cool effect.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:16.080]   A couple of takeaways.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.900]   Maybe this is why when I brainstorm,
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.720]   I'm trying to find the new angle to solve a proof
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.760]   or a new idea for an article or book,
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.980]   I tend to do it on foot outside.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.800]   Now I often attribute that to the motion,
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.000]   the locomotion helps me clarify, reduce the noise
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.120]   to get to original thought,
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.080]   to recognize the signal of original thought.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.120]   Huberman would say, yeah, but also the sky is high.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.000]   And so you're in a better physical environment
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.040]   for brainstorming.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.660]   And when it comes time to write,
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:45.920]   you know, I write in my study,
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.200]   which is dark colored and books all around me,
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.520]   maybe that's better for trying to get the details just right.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.360]   It's a cathedral effect, I like that.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.200]   All right, one more.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.280]   We can't do an interesting mailbag feature
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.880]   without some obligatory focus porn.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.040]   It's my term for finding examples
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.200]   of beautifully aesthetic, deeply aspirational examples
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.760]   of people going to radical means
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.880]   to find concentration and peace and quiet
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.360]   to actually focus and do work.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.240]   So today's example of focus porn was sent to me,
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.160]   look, I have his name here, from Andrew.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.080]   And, you know, I feel bad, I forgot the name of,
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.160]   I think it's Alistair Humphreys
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.400]   is I think who these examples are from.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.160]   There's a link, there's a link in the description
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.200]   of where this comes from.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.120]   These are some stills I took from a video,
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.840]   a beautifully shot video that this writer produced.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:44.440]   And the video starts with him in his home office,
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.480]   overwhelmed and distracted.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.600]   You know, it's edited, so he has phone calls coming in,
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.320]   he's being real distracted, and he's writing a book.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.680]   And so he goes and retreats to this,
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.840]   I guess you would call it a shed,
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.000]   in the middle of nowhere mountains.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.320]   The video follows him hiking.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.820]   And the picture you're seeing now on the screen
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.200]   is of a man leaning against a house.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.240]   It's a rock fall on a deserted mountain.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.560]   And the rocks have been stacked to make a rock house
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.160]   or shed or whatever you would call it
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.840]   in the middle of nowhere with one window.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.040]   And he's out there writing.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.520]   And then the second picture I have
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.360]   is him inside this rock house.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.240]   And it's dark except for the light
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.160]   from the one window illuminating him.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.680]   And he has a coffee mug and a notebook
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.460]   on which he's doing his writing.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:30.040]   Anyways, I recommend watching the video
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.120]   'cause it's beautifully shot.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.720]   I don't know what type of cameras he's using.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.300]   It's beautifully shot, and it's gonna make you want
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:39.040]   to go to Iceland before you write that next report
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.240]   or try to write that next algorithm.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.920]   So check out these pictures or that video
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.600]   if you want just a weekly burst of that nice,
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.520]   ah, feeling you get when you see people,
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.760]   at least for a little while, escaping from all the noise
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:58.400]   that sit in the rocks with coffee and a notebook,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.300]   as we all wanna do from time to time.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:06.040]   Jesse, if our studio was in a rock shed like that,
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.040]   I think that would be the big move right there.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.320]   That'd be the big time move,
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   is if we hiked up to a mountain like that,
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.600]   and that's where we recorded from.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.400]   I think that's what would make this show,
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.960]   I think, really sink in for the audience.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.900]   Like these guys are for real.
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:21.080]   I mean, it'd be inconvenient
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.680]   'cause we'd have to hike for hours every day.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.720]   - Yeah, bring up firewood during the wintertime.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.280]   - Just a fire going.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.640]   I have a fire in my study.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.960]   - Oh yeah, you've mentioned that.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.200]   - Yeah, I got a gas fireplace,
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:35.200]   so I can turn on flames when I wanna be in winter mode.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.240]   But this guy is big time to me with his rock.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.560]   - It is Alistair Humphreys.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.720]   - Alistair Humphreys, okay, excellent.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.360]   All right, everyone, well, that's enough for today.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.880]   That's the end of our episode.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.280]   Thank everyone who sent in your questions.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.420]   Go to the survey link in the show notes
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.720]   if you wanna submit your questions
