[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:14.720]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.880]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.480]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs, yet again.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.760]   Duncan, one of the great things about Bird Dogs
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.260]   is it goes with just about anything.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.480]   Today I'm wearing a nice new polo shirt, right?
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.640]   Got the nice collar, and it goes well with a Bird Dog.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.680]   I can wear a button-down Hawaiian shirt,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.320]   or just a t-shirt, maybe a tank top in the summer.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   If it's hot, it's been like 90 degrees here lately.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760]   Very, very versatile.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.960]   So birddogs.com/ATC.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.800]   Remember, use the code ATC.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.920]   Get yourself a free Tumblr.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.080]   These things are the most comfortable shorts in the summer.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.220]   All right, the last few weeks,
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.800]   we've gotten a ton of questions from people
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.520]   about the debt ceiling debate,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.920]   and should I sell, and should I worry about the volatility?
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.400]   And obviously that stuff has taken care of itself,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.760]   and it's fine now.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.960]   Kind of like I said it would, but let's say I was wrong,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.240]   right, would you still be right for panicking
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.040]   if I was wrong and they didn't come to a deal,
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   and there was volatility?
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.240]   Probably not, that's my whole point here,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.280]   is that taking these macro news headline events
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.120]   and trying to trade them, or time them,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.160]   or get in front of them is basically never a good idea.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.200]   You should make financial moves in your portfolio
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.680]   because of fundamentals,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.120]   or your circumstances are changing,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.440]   or you need to spend, or a good reason,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.680]   a legitimate reason, not because you're trying to guess
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.720]   which way things are gonna go based on the headline.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.560]   And that's the whole thing,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.440]   it's like the process over outcomes,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.040]   and not freaking out and panicking
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.220]   just because you're trying to just get ahead of things.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.800]   Hopefully you didn't panic and sell your triple-levered,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.640]   whatever. - No, no, no.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920]   I didn't sell.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yeah, I'll write something down 80%, you know what I mean.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.340]   - (laughs) There you go.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.180]   Panic later.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.680]   All right, let's get into a question.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.640]   - Okay, up first today, we have a question from Webb.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.960]   When we read articles about how much you should have saved
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.560]   by age X, should it not be how much income
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.400]   you'll be earning with savings Y?
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.520]   Here's my scenario.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.640]   Mid-30s, worked at a public university for 11 years,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.820]   and left to take a job in the private sector.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.200]   I have a pension at the university
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.720]   with a guaranteed fixed income,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.880]   and just started a new 401(k).
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.860]   Total retirement savings doesn't help me know
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.120]   if I'm on pace.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.360]   Assuming a presumed 5% withdrawal rate
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720]   and 8% 401(k) growth rate,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.520]   wouldn't a calculated retirement payout
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.080]   that can include things like pensions and social security
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.380]   be better than make sure you have $1 million
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.240]   by age 50, et cetera?
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.760]   - See, look at how intelligent our audience is.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.840]   This is a great question.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.000]   I like where your head's at.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.840]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.360]   Remember those ING commercials five or six years ago,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.800]   and people would be carrying around their number
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.880]   with them on the street?
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.480]   And like, I need to get this number.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.740]   I need 500,000, I need a million, I need five million,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.580]   whatever it is.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.740]   I think the number itself is meaningless
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.580]   without some context.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.920]   So Kahneman said in one of his books,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   might've been the Michael Lewis book
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.480]   that he wrote about Kahneman and Tversky,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.800]   he said like, how do you understand memory?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.480]   You don't study memory, you study forgetting, right?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.920]   It's like the Charlie Munker, invert, always invert thing.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.880]   I like the idea of backing into how much you need to save
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.560]   based on how much you spend
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.900]   and what your other income sources are.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.100]   Because like, there are so many different questions
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400]   that you have to go through to think in terms of like,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.560]   what am I gonna spend on healthcare?
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.000]   And what are the market returns going to be when I retire?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.360]   And what if there's a bear market when I retire?
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.780]   And what if my spending changes?
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.040]   And all these other things.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.160]   So let's get in.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.100]   I think the spending thing is a good one
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.360]   because the retirement calculators think about life
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.460]   in a linear fashion, right?
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.880]   You're gonna spend this much every year at this percentage,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.160]   but people don't live in a straight line.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.480]   People's lives change.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.220]   So John, put this chart on for me.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.240]   This is from the BLS.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.000]   They break out all sorts of data
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.880]   on income and spending levels by age.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.440]   And they look at this average expenditures per year.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.040]   These are annual expenditures.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.460]   And you can see the way the chart goes
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.160]   in your 20s and 30s, you sort of ramp up
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   because obviously you don't make a lot of money.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   And then in your 50s, 40s and 50s, you're spending peaks.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   And these are average numbers.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.680]   And then as you age, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s,
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.960]   the numbers actually go down again,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.520]   which this actually makes a lot of sense to me, right?
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.600]   And I think a lot of people don't think about this,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.100]   but is it much easier to travel the world
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.900]   or go on a cruise or something when you're 65
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.940]   than when you're 85, right?
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.140]   So that's why you don't spend as much.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.080]   So the way that you think about spending goes down.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.800]   That Die With Zero guy, Bill Perkins,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.240]   did you read that one yet, Duncan?
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.440]   - I haven't, that's on my list,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.200]   but yeah, I got a lot on my list first.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.720]   - He actually says like your net worth
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.560]   should also peak in your 50s.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.280]   I think he says like 50 or 55
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.440]   is when your net worth should be peaking.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.040]   You should be spending it down faster
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.840]   because you want to do it when you're physically
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.160]   and mentally able to do it, right?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.440]   So I do agree with this idea
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.400]   that coming up with a number is the wrong way
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   to go through it, especially for someone-
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.580]   - It's kind of like responsible YOLOing.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.800]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.600]   And it's about smoothing things out
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.240]   and using it when you have it.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.200]   I think this is especially true
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.680]   for someone in their 20s, 30s or 40s.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.120]   Like trying to go through the retirement planning process
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.320]   is very difficult.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.880]   Like, I don't know what tax rates are gonna be.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   I don't know what market returns are going to be.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.680]   I don't know what interest rates are gonna be.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.520]   Inflation, you don't know where you're gonna live,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.760]   what your cost of living is gonna be.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   All these things, there's so many different variables
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.960]   that can get in the way.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.440]   And that's why I think that financial planning
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.760]   is a process and not an event.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.120]   Usually moving the goalposts is a derogatory phrase.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.880]   Like it's a bad thing you're moving the goalposts.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.240]   But I think in this instance,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.640]   moving the goalposts is actually good
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.240]   because it should be kind of a moving average
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   and a moving range of results
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   that you're kind of looking for
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.960]   as opposed to I'm gonna hit this exact number.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.280]   And I think, yeah, you want to back into it.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.520]   And as you get closer and those expectations become reality,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.560]   then you can make course corrections along the way
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.000]   in terms of your saving, your spending,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.280]   or market expectations and all these things.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.120]   I think that's the idea.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.280]   That's why it is a very hard process to go through
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.640]   'cause no one knows what their life is gonna look like
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.880]   in two years, let alone 20 years.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.560]   - Yeah, it's true.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.000]   - I like the way he's thinking about it here.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.760]   - With the goalposts thing, just a quick aside,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.600]   what kind of goalposts are we talking about?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.240]   You know, are we talking about a basketball goal
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.000]   or are we talking about like soccer goal?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.120]   I guess any could work.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.960]   - That's true.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.160]   You can't really move goalposts.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.240]   I guess football is in my thinking, but-
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.360]   - Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.400]   Maybe that's it.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.120]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.800]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Love to Audit.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.140]   I'm guessing this one came from social media.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.440]   I'm 35 and trying to get some direction on lifestyle.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.040]   - Maybe his dad was just a tax consultant.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.880]   - Yeah, maybe.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.960]   I'm 35 and trying to get some direction
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.720]   on lifestyle versus aggressive saving.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.280]   This is a common theme we're seeing these days,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.640]   so good people are thinking about this.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.280]   The money I have saved doesn't feel tangible
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.540]   in terms of lifestyle.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.200]   I make $120,000 to $150,000 a year,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.280]   rent and have a roommate, drive a '90s car,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.960]   cook my own food, and live in a very high cost
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.480]   of living coastal city.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.860]   Obligatory not to brag, I have $3,000 in my HSA,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.360]   $8,000 cash, $16,000 in company RSUs,
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   $52,000 in a Roth IRA, $169,000 in my Roth 401(k),
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.840]   and $265,000 in a traditional 401(k),
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.480]   and $615,000 in a brokerage account.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.320]   They started off, you see they worked their way up there,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   you know, smaller, smaller figures working out.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.800]   - Yeah, pyramid here.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.840]   - Yeah, a down payment on a home here
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.240]   is in the $100,000 to $250,000 range,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.380]   depending on location/commute,
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.720]   but buying here would eviscerate my monthly savings rate.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.360]   I'm considering a move to a cheaper state
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.220]   despite my family being here.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.680]   All of my friends are settling down,
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.280]   starting families, having kids,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.720]   and here I am with roommates.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.240]   Admittedly, money seems to be getting
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.560]   in the way of my goals.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.800]   Do I really need to choose between these extremes,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.200]   saving versus comfortable lifestyle?
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.040]   - All right, this is a very existential question.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.480]   This is like a not to brag,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.880]   but also I'm kind of stuck here, right?
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.400]   This person seems to be living like
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.600]   probably the fire lifestyle,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   so I just, back of the envelope this,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.680]   by my calculation, this person at 35 is a millionaire.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.040]   They have like a $1.1 million,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.680]   and the crazy thing is,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.920]   this person is literally a finance compounding example.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.200]   So I use this in one of my books.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.040]   So, John, throw up my little table here.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.800]   My sister's name is Sarah, my brother's name is John,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.200]   so I helped them out here and I used them.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.000]   So Sarah starts saving at age 25.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.080]   She stops at 35.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.480]   She saves $500 a month.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.640]   Total saved is $66,000.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.280]   If she earns 7% a year at 65,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.680]   she's gonna have $720,000.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.920]   John doesn't start at saving until he's 40.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.880]   By age 60, and he saves the whole time until he's 65.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   He saved for 25 years, Sarah saved for 10.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.240]   John saved almost three times as much money,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.560]   but ends up with $412,000, right?
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.480]   Assuming those same,
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.280]   and the reason here is 'cause Sarah
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.680]   did the compounding thing.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.520]   This love to audit person is this example.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.480]   They saved so much by age 35,
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.520]   they could just let it go and they'd be fine.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.080]   So if you, I looked at it.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.920]   If you, if we look at their $1 million, right?
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.960]   Let's say, let's assume they take 100 grand out
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.800]   for their down payment for their house
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.720]   and they have a million dollars left over.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   They don't contribute another dime
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.320]   the rest of their life, right?
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.120]   If their investments grow at 6% per year
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.320]   for the next 30 years,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.360]   they'll have something like $5.7 million
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.600]   at retirement at 65, right?
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.760]   Or let's say they just,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.120]   all they do is max out their 401k, it's 20 grand a year.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   They'd have like seven and a half million dollars
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.640]   in 30 years.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.880]   So you're already so far ahead of the game
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.760]   because you saved and scrimmed early,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.920]   but now you're having this existential crisis of,
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.800]   oh geez, I'm in my 30s.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.760]   I live with a roommate.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   I drive a 1990s car.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.920]   If I had to guess, this person drives in a Accord.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.760]   Has to be.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.600]   - Okay, I'm so glad you mentioned it.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.920]   I was gonna guess a Volvo station wagon.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.060]   - Okay, that sounds, those are both fire-ish cars, but.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.880]   So this person obviously has a wonderful savings.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.080]   They've already done the hard part.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.160]   They saved a boatload of money in their 30s.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.120]   So they have the delayed gratification part down,
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.040]   living with a roommate, driving an old car, all this stuff.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.800]   It's time to enjoy yourself a little bit, you know?
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   Go live on your own.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.720]   Buy that house in the city
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.760]   or move somewhere else and buy there.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.880]   But I think you're doing just fine.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.040]   At your income and savings level,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.160]   you don't need to choose between the two.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.320]   You already have a seven-figure net worth.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.160]   So you don't have to buy a home if you don't want to,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.720]   but you certainly are in a good position to.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.600]   And here's the thing.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.520]   I'm giving you permission to lower your savings rate
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.000]   because that's the great thing
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.320]   about having such a high savings rate.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.160]   And I don't know what it is,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.280]   but this person obviously probably,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.880]   we're probably in the 50 to 60% range, I'm guessing,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.200]   based on how much money they have saved.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.240]   That's the great thing about having a high savings rate
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.160]   is it's a margin of safety to pull the lever
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.480]   when you need to spend a little more.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.720]   So if, yeah, you're gonna take 150,000 out
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.200]   for a down payment and the mortgage is gonna be way more
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.980]   'cause you're not sharing with a roommate anymore.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.400]   But that's why you have a high savings rate to begin with,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   because it allows you to pull that one down.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.760]   And the other thing is,
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.720]   you can grow into that mortgage over time, right?
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.840]   This person is obviously a financially successful person.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.800]   I'm guessing their income
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.040]   is gonna continue to grow over time, right?
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.680]   So maybe for a few years,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.440]   it's gonna be painful and your savings rate's gonna go
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.000]   from 50 to 25 or 20 or maybe 10 or 15.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840]   But so what?
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.800]   You can grow into it and as your income increases,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.160]   then you can start saving more piece by piece.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.420]   So I think this person
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.040]   is in a wonderful position financially.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.240]   They need to worry more about their life, frankly, I think,
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.840]   and figure out how to have a little more fun
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.180]   and stop having their savings rate dictate their entire life
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.020]   because, as they said, at a certain point,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.760]   those benchmarks and goalposts along the way that,
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.240]   oh, I see this money in my account or my brokerage account,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.840]   it doesn't really do anything for you.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.400]   At a certain point, it loses its luster.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.440]   It doesn't make you happy.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.480]   The whole point of saving in the first place
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.960]   is you're gonna spend it someday.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.220]   So now is the time to spend it
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.920]   and make yourself a little happier.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.680]   - Right.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.500]   Also, I just had an idea.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.840]   We should start having you write permission slips.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.120]   You know, like you used to get in school
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.080]   for different things.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.400]   You could write permission slips
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.440]   for people to adjust their savings rate.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.280]   - Yes.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.560]   Again, some people are gonna hear this and go,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.120]   geez, I'm gonna play the world's smallest violin
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.000]   for this person.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   They save too much money and they can't enjoy themselves.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.200]   But it is a real problem for some people.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.820]   And I think you get into that mindset
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.580]   of saving, saving, saving,
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.160]   and you have your head down and you look up and you go,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.720]   wait, what did I miss out on?
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.480]   And I think in your mid-30s, you still have plenty of time.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.320]   - Yeah.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.520]   Life's what happens while you're busy making other plans.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.600]   - What is the Andy Dufresne?
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.260]   Get busy living or get busy dying?
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.560]   - Yeah, that's a good one too.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.960]   - All right, next question.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.120]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Scott.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.520]   I just listened to last week's show and heard Benny Markets.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.200]   Benny Markets is a favorite, people love him.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.040]   - Fan favorite for sure.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.240]   Everyone likes his enthusiasm.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.920]   - Also, I told him, I thought that was an all-time phrase,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.240]   calling you smarter, Ben.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.600]   That really cracked me up.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   - I've heard that before.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.560]   - Anyway, I just listened to last week's show
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.160]   and heard Benny Markets say he keeps his short-term cash
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.600]   in bill, which is an ETF,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.800]   which looks like it pays 4.55% right now.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.260]   I realize it's small potatoes
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.040]   and maybe that answers the question,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.560]   but is there any reason to choose that
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.780]   over a money market fund like SWVXX
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.500]   that pays 4.9% at present?
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.760]   Neither have locked in rates,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.920]   though maybe bill is slower to move downward.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.760]   Love the show.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.560]   Wish I had something to not brag about.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   - This one's from Scott.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.640]   Hey, Scott, do not sell yourself short.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.720]   You have cash available to invest in T-bills
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.560]   and a money market fund.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.860]   That is something to brag about.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.040]   You can brag about that.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.880]   I'll give it to you.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.260]   That's my permission to slip to Scott.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.100]   So here's the thing.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.020]   Before we get into the comparison here,
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.040]   I wanna just give a little bit of a tutorial
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.560]   on the yields on some of these funds.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.280]   So BIL is simply a T-bill ETF, right?
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.760]   And so, John, throw up the yield here.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.000]   So I think what this person is looking at
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.840]   is the wrong yield.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   So if you go to the fund for this 30-day SEC yield,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.800]   and I think this might be a little old from the emailer.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.880]   So they said 4.55.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.320]   It's now 4.67.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.640]   The 30-day SEC yield is just the income
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.500]   over the past 30 days paid out.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.240]   So it cares more about these actual,
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.200]   and it annualizes it,
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.380]   the actual cash flows and the go-forward yield.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.700]   It's backward looking.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.220]   And I prefer to look at the average yield of maturity.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.800]   So John put up the next one.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.960]   This is the average yield of maturity.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.480]   You can see it's 5.2%, almost.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.520]   So why is the difference?
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.480]   Because the yield of maturity
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.040]   is simply the market-weighted average
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.380]   of the holdings in the current portfolio
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.800]   if they were held to maturity.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.640]   And I think this,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.040]   so this takes into account current yields
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.800]   and what they would look like going forward.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.360]   So I think this is especially important
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.500]   when yields are changing a lot,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.460]   as they have the past few years,
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.400]   especially for short-term stuff like this.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.360]   So the yield to maturity is way more important
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.100]   than the SEC yield, which kind of shows what happened.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.880]   The yield to maturity is sort of what's going to happen.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.320]   And obviously, the rates can change,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.800]   and that yield to maturity can change
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.840]   if rates rise or fall.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.640]   But that's just so you know.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.920]   So the yield on this T-bill ETF
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.540]   is actually better than you think.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.120]   But let's say those yields are right,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.920]   and you're looking for an extra 45 or 50 basis points.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.000]   If I'm still getting permission here,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I'm giving you permission to do that one time, maybe.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.260]   Like one time, okay, you're doing a bump in yield.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.640]   But if you're gonna do that all the time,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.360]   it seems like kind of a waste of time to me
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.240]   to constantly be chasing the best yield,
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240]   how much bang for your buck
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.720]   you're really gonna get in that kind of move.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.080]   In terms of the timing of the rates,
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   that's a good question.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.360]   Will money market rates fall quicker,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.640]   or will T-bill yields fall quicker?
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.480]   We don't know for sure,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.760]   but here's my general rule of thumbs when it comes to banks.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.440]   Not all banks, but most banks.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.840]   Banks are slower to raise yields and quicker to cut them,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.920]   just like they're quicker to raise borrowing rates
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.560]   and slower to cut them.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.460]   Right, does that make sense?
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.600]   Took a long time, so John, throw a chart on
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.360]   of money market rates versus T-bill yields
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.980]   over the last two years or so.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.440]   So T-bills are in orange here.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.680]   You can see they started moving up in January.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.240]   It took money markets until May to start moving up.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.080]   And so basically, T-bill yields
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.640]   are leading money market yields here.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.320]   And this is, the average money market yield
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.760]   is lower right now than T-bill yields.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.260]   Average T-bill yields are closing in on 5.5%,
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.200]   and average money market yields are like 4.8.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.560]   Obviously, that depends on your institution
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.200]   and where you're looking, and that can be different.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.000]   So treasuries go out first, and money markets follow on a lag.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.440]   I think going down, we could actually see the opposite.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.680]   I think money market yields will probably fall faster
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.960]   because the banks aren't gonna keep paying you more
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.120]   for the yield, so they'll either fall in concert
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.480]   or a little bit faster.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.800]   So there you go.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.400]   T-bill yields are probably better than you think
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.920]   in terms of these ETFs.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.760]   I wouldn't be constantly chasing yield here.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   If you've done it once or twice, that's fine.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.380]   I wouldn't be doing it all the time
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.320]   because it's probably not worth the hassle.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.260]   And especially if you're jumping in and out of an ETF,
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.420]   you're paying taxes and it's just not worth your time.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.080]   But the most important thing is going from,
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   like we talked about last week,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.480]   10 basis points or whatever to four or five.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.880]   Once you get to four or five, just stick with what you got.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.040]   - Do you want to put it on the record here?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.080]   Do you want to call when they're gonna cut?
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.400]   Is that in mind or anything?
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.240]   - Geez.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.960]   - Just kidding.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.660]   - I'd have to know when the recession's gonna start
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.740]   because if the Fed creates a recession,
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.960]   then they're gonna cut pretty quick.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.040]   That's the thing.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.000]   - I thought the recession started last year.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.480]   - Well, let's see.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.680]   It's always three months from now.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.960]   All right, another question.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.440]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Brandon.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.840]   My wife and I just had our first child six months ago.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.680]   Congrats.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.240]   - Yeah, congrats on the addition.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.360]   - Wondering what investment vehicle or options
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.160]   you recommend beyond a 529
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.480]   that we could use to save for our child's future.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.080]   A wedding, house, et cetera.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.980]   UGMA, Roth, IRA, traditional investment account.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.380]   Those are their questions.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.960]   - All right, we get a ton of questions.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.000]   This is another pat on the back to our audience
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.480]   who is obviously thinking ahead.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.960]   I like the idea 'cause you're not only thinking
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.200]   in terms of compound interest
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.740]   and planning ahead for your child's future,
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.860]   but it's your own future too, right?
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.740]   Because you want to get them off your payroll some day.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.040]   Starting to save for them now is probably a good thing,
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.520]   especially for weddings and that sort of thing.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.300]   So I like the idea here.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.280]   This is definitely more of a financial planning question
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.360]   than an investment question, I think.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.720]   So let's bring a financial planner in here
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.980]   to help out with this one.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.720]   - Hey, Ross. - Ross Cohen.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.200]   Ross is an advisor with us at Ritholtz Wealth.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.560]   He is in our Chicago office,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.600]   which is easily one of the best cities
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   in the country in the summer.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.440]   Correct, Ross?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.260]   - It has to be.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.920]   - Of course, nothing better than Chicago in the summer.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.600]   - All right, so young people, young person here,
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.660]   you work with a handful of younger clients
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.840]   and want to know how to plan for the child's future.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.820]   I like, again, I like where their head's at here,
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.800]   but what do you think are some of the considerations
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.020]   in terms of the kind of accounts we're looking at here?
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.280]   - Yeah, as you guys mentioned,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.840]   congrats to Brandon on the newborn.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.440]   I'd love to see a timestamp on this question
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.000]   when it came in.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.460]   Ben, it feels to me like this was something
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.640]   that was like late at night
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.360]   while he's probably not sleeping much
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.880]   and thinking about his kid's future
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.960]   and potential wedding and first home purchase.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.880]   So I'd love to see a timestamp on it.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.160]   - Probably not in the first three months
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.540]   because that's kind of a blur when that happens.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.220]   But yeah, good on him for thinking ahead here.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.640]   - Yeah, and as you mentioned before,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.400]   our listeners are in the 99th percentile
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.080]   thinking about this type of thing.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.160]   They've gone above and beyond.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.320]   They're already doing the 529 plan
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.000]   and they're thinking, okay, what's next?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.160]   Beyond college, what's the next step?
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.240]   What's the next best place that I should be saving?
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.440]   And I created a chart for this.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.840]   I've always wanted to say this, so chart on.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.360]   Oh, you beat me to it, Duncan.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.600]   - That's John, that's John.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.900]   - Oh, sorry about that, John.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.440]   So there's a couple of different vehicles.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.360]   As Brandon's already doing, he's got the 529 covered.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.180]   He's already contributing to the 529.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.520]   I'm gonna skip over the Coverdell.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.440]   It's an older type of investment vehicle
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.840]   meant for private education.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.360]   So the two other areas are the UTMA/UGMA
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.580]   and just a general brokerage account.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.800]   The reason why I love 529 plans so much
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.860]   is that there's amazing benefits to saving into a 529.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.360]   For most states, you actually get a state tax deduction
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.000]   when you contribute to a 529 plan.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.080]   Going down the line, there's no income limits
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.120]   and you have lifetime control over the assets,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.900]   meaning that when the kid turns 18 or 21,
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.480]   they don't get this chunk of change
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.600]   where they can then go buy a convertible
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.480]   or some whatever they want, right?
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.580]   The 529 plan, as the parent,
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.480]   you maintain ownership over the assets.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.360]   - I never thought about that.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.180]   That makes sense.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.520]   I've never heard it mentioned that way.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   That makes a lot of sense, actually.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.840]   - Yeah, the last area that it's really important to
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.720]   is financial aid.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.680]   So if there is a potential to receive financial aid,
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   UTMA and UGMA accounts are deducted at a higher rate
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.480]   than 529 plans and parents' assets.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.340]   So the low-hanging fruit, as you're already doing,
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.700]   is 529 plan.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.920]   Saving early and often in the 529 plan
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.420]   is gonna be your best bet.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.300]   If you are looking to earmark money
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.380]   for a future down payment for your kid
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.380]   25, 30 years down the road or another purchase,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.220]   that's where I would suggest
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.620]   going with just a brokerage account in your name
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.020]   or a joint account with you and your spouse
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.240]   and having it earmarked for that purpose.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.460]   That way, when it comes up,
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.440]   whether it's a wedding or a purchase,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.680]   you can then gift them the money
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.880]   and you have a little bit more control over the asset.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.000]   - The other downside to UTMA or UGMA
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.940]   is it's just the worst sounding acronym in finance.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.920]   Like, they just don't sound appealing, right?
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.960]   Ugh, right?
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.560]   - I'm not a big fan of UTMAs,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.100]   just 'cause once they turn 18 or 21, that money is theirs.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.600]   That is out of your control.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.580]   Even if you want it earmarked for a down payment,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.620]   it's out of your hands.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.900]   - Here's my other consideration for Brandon here.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.660]   You need a DeLorean that can go 88
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.580]   and go back in time to when you're like 17
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.020]   and start saving for daycare,
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.340]   because no one tells you
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.700]   that putting your kids through daycare
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.960]   is basically like putting them through college,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.700]   but you don't get 18 years to save.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.660]   I'm still a little bitter about the daycare costs.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.300]   - What if you space your children
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   so that the oldest one is old enough
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.120]   to take care of your second, you know?
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.680]   That seems like alpha.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.600]   - There you go.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.840]   - That's some intense family planning there.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.660]   - All right.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.500]   Ross, I like the visuals.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.080]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.860]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Brett.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.280]   I'm a single 33-year-old freelancer
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.640]   living in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.440]   Shout out, North Carolina.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.240]   Being self-employed, I don't have access
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.000]   to a traditional 401(k) plan.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.360]   Also, not to brag, but my income level
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.660]   has disqualified me from Roth IRA contributions.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.860]   I'm an aggressive saver/investor,
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.220]   but the only accounts available to me
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.080]   are an IRA with a $6,500 annual limit
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.900]   and a taxable brokerage account.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.140]   This has resulted in an ever-increasing imbalance
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.700]   of the three-bucket strategy,
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.820]   200K brokerage, 50K IRA, 50K Roth IRA.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.380]   Am I setting myself up for trouble down the road?
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.740]   Would a solo 401(k) or SEP 401(k) be a better option?
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.740]   - Okay, this is a question
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.200]   that's becoming more and more relevant to a lot of people.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.400]   John, throw up the chart on here of business applications.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.800]   So this is business applications since the pandemic.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.880]   You can see the huge spike.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.720]   I think it was like 5 million or something
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.120]   new business applications since the start of the pandemic.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.200]   So if you have a side hustle,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.000]   you're starting your own business,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.960]   I think it makes a lot of sense to think through this
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.160]   because there is no universal 401(k) plan.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.080]   I wish there was, like the thrift savings plan, the TSP.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.640]   Duncan, nice shirt.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.620]   I like it, you got it, huh?
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.540]   - Duncan's sporting the new Tropical Brothers shirt.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.800]   All right, it looks good.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.880]   Someone must have just reminded you.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   So short of having a universal retirement account,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.440]   because a lot of people just simply don't have access
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.400]   to a 401(k), what are the options here, Ross?
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.840]   - Yeah, I love the question.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.680]   And they're thinking about diversification in two sense,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.080]   right, there's the asset diversification,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.260]   meaning investing not just in the S&P 500 globally,
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.920]   diversified portfolios.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.200]   Talk about that all the time.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.080]   But then there's tax diversification, right,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.280]   where you don't want all of your money,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.640]   whether it's in a brokerage account or an IRA or a Roth IRA.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.480]   That way down the road, you have different levers
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.760]   that you can pull, whether it's in five years, 10 years,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.220]   or 20 or 30 years in retirement.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.800]   So there's a few different options.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.360]   And to answer his question too,
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.520]   he's not setting himself up to failure
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.400]   just by investing in a brokerage account.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.360]   But if you do wanna invest in a tax advantaged vehicle,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.080]   solo 401(k) and a SEP IRA are both terrific options
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.320]   for someone in his situation that's a entrepreneur.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.760]   Depending on his situation,
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.000]   there's a couple of different pros and cons.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.080]   - Just so we know, I'll do a visual here, John.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.040]   I have a, I actually have a SEP IRA.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.960]   This is the one that I use because I have money
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.940]   that is on the side outside of my employer income.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.080]   And some people say that I'm an idiot,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.200]   I should have a solo 401(k).
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.080]   So Ross, what do we got here for the differences?
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.960]   - Yeah, the main difference is the flexibility
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.560]   within the two.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.080]   So if you are gonna maintain being just you
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.040]   or you and your spouse in the business,
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.240]   the solo 401(k) is gonna be a better option.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.600]   The reason why it's a better option
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.480]   is there's more flexibility within the solo 401(k).
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.120]   The max contribution for both is $66,000 per year.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   Solo 401(k), once you're above age 50,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.260]   you also have that catch-up provision
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.120]   where you can contribute a little bit more.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.000]   Here's where the differences come into play.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.660]   So with a solo 401(k), there's a combination
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.120]   of both employer contributions and employee contributions.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.080]   What that leads to is more flexibility
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.200]   with how much you can contribute.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.080]   As you can see there on the SEP IRA side,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.600]   that max contribution, it's subject to your compensation.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.080]   Your max contribution is subject to your compensation,
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.480]   25% versus in the solo 401(k),
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   you can contribute as an employee up to $22,500 per year.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.320]   - So does it matter that this guy is a solo business owner?
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.400]   Does that come into play at all?
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.240]   - Yep, absolutely.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.200]   So since he is solo,
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.240]   the solo 401(k) would be a better option.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.600]   It allows for more flexibility.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.440]   - Funny how that works.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.880]   He's a solo business owner of a solo 401(k).
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.720]   It's almost like it was--
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.880]   - Go figure, yeah, go figure.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.240]   The government doesn't wanna steer anyone
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   in one direction, right?
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.400]   But there you go, a solo 401(k) right in the name.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.640]   - Okay, so that makes sense.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.600]   And the other thing is,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.880]   so I personally have a 401(k) through work
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.160]   and I also have the SEP.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.120]   So you have to take into account
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.600]   those personal 401(k) contributions as well
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.480]   so you don't go over, right?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.160]   So that kind of eats into your max contribution.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.120]   - Yeah, it's viewed as a whole.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.640]   Yep, it's a whole.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.720]   - So you have to look at them both.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.240]   If you, not to brag,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.920]   I have multiple retirement accounts, multiple.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.280]   - Yeah, you can't do 66,000
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.120]   in two different type of accounts.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.880]   - Right, yeah, it comes together.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.720]   So I guess that--
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   - It's not about everything.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.440]   - So you mentioned that there's an employee,
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.000]   an employer contribution for the solo.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   If you're a solo practitioner, you're both, right?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.080]   So you can, that means you can put more money in,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.920]   potentially.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.760]   - You are both, yeah.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.720]   It just allows a little bit more flexibility.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.840]   So let's say you make,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.120]   it doesn't sound like this is the case,
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.000]   but if you make like $70,000 per year
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.200]   when you're starting out in the business,
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.800]   you can contribute from the employee side that 22.5.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.320]   It's not subject to your income limits at 25%.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.840]   - Gotcha, okay.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.960]   Duncan, I just say that your transition to middle age
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.080]   is gonna be wonderful,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.200]   with that shirt and the beard and the hat.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.920]   You're already there, basically.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.960]   - Yeah, no, I like to think that, yeah,
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.440]   I'm pretty much there.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.280]   - It looks wonderful.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.600]   Okay, thank you to Ross for coming in.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.680]   Ross put up a good fight,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.040]   even though someone broke into his office
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.480]   and stole his microphone last night,
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.560]   which it must have been,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.440]   is there a gang of like out of work podcast people
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   that are going around taking people's microphones?
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.720]   - I bet that's it.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.040]   - It was a strange morning trying to figure out
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.480]   what was going on here with just the microphone missing
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.920]   and nothing else.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.800]   It's a little bit confused.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.040]   Thought someone played a prank on me,
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.200]   but yeah, it turns out it was real.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.640]   I also do wanna say that I think love to audit.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.160]   I think they have a Subaru.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.000]   That's my guess.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.120]   - Ah, okay, Subaru, I can see that.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   - I can see that. - Outback.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.600]   - Like a legacy or an Outback?
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.440]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.840]   - Probably an Outback, yeah, like a '90s Outback.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.680]   - All right, remember.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.920]   - I forgot to throw in the doc,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.960]   but I wanted to say Tony wrote in
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.240]   and said it's he and his wife Melissa's
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.440]   one year wedding anniversary
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.160]   and watching the compound helped them save up
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.440]   for their wedding.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.560]   So yeah, congrats. - Oh, wow.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.680]   Wanted to say congrats. - Kudos.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.840]   Lot of congrats all the way around.
