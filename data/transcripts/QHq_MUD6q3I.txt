[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700]   When I'm not confused for a cosmetologist, you know, because of my lovely hair and makeup,
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.320]   I'm usually asked, you know, "Oh, you're an astronomer, I'm a Virgo, you know, so what's
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   going to happen to me?"
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.600]   I'm like, I used to be, "Oh, okay, that's an astrologer, I'm not an astrologer," but
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.960]   now I just, I kind of lean into it.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.040]   I'm like, "Ooh, you're going to get a letter from the IRS next week," and that lump on
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.040]   your ass, that's...
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.800]   You mean you're playing games with them?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.800]   So you don't believe in astrology?
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.680]   There's no evidence for astrology.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.440]   In fact, there's, you know, many, many random controlled trials, double-bund study that
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.760]   showed not only is it, it's almost counter to the evidence, you know, like when they
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.520]   say that a monkey can throw a dart at a stock chart and get, you know, do better than most
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.240]   hedge fund managers or something like that, actually astrologers are even worse.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.200]   Like I don't even know a protozoa could throw a dart, yeah.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.800]   It's almost anti-correlated, you know, with what reality is.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.020]   So no, there's certainly no validity to that.
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.160]   And I had a provocative tweet, you know, whatever, post recently, and it was about, there's actually,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.520]   you know, we believe there are 12 zodiac signs and that dates back to the Persians and the
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.840]   Babylonians and how they divided up them.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.920]   And it almost divides, you know, they were fascinated with the number 60.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.000]   So that was the base of their number system.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.720]   Our number system is 10 because we have 10 figures.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.960]   For some reason they love base 60, I don't know why.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.840]   And so they love things that divided evenly into it, 10 does, but anyway, you know, #fail
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.800]   for the Babylonians, but they divided it up into 12 zodiac signs.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   So we still use those.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.480]   There was a problem though.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.880]   The zodiac that you're, do you know what this is?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   Do you know what determines your zodiac sign?
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   No.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.000]   So it's determined by the position of the sun, what constellation was the sun in on
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.080]   the day you were born, September 26th.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.000]   So when the, that means that the sun was in the constellation Virgo, oh no, you were a
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Libra?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Libra.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.740]   I don't know if you are, but you don't know why you are.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.560]   So Libra means it's a constellation, there's 88 constellations that are accepted by astronomers.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.040]   And the, one of them is Libra and the path that the sun and the moon and all the planets
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.860]   travel in is called the zodiac.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.780]   It's confined to a plane because the same proto-solar system disk from which we formed
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.320]   out of, all the planets came out of a nebular cloud, a cloud of gas, dust, rocks, and so
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.800]   forth that came from a preexisting star that exploded, creating what's called a supernova.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.400]   The supernova provided the materials to make not only the earth, but the entire solar system,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   including the sun.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.760]   That happened about 5 billion years ago.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.480]   And 4 billion years ago, the earth formed out of that cloud.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.800]   The spin of that disk, all things have a spin associated with them, like a figure skater,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.660]   you know, she's spinning around on her axis or whatever, she can have her arms out, brings
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.020]   them in, she spins faster.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.220]   That's called conservation of angular momentum.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.880]   Spin is a type of angular momentum.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.700]   The whole disk is spinning in a plane.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.420]   It's like this desk, this table that we're sitting at, if you're listening, you imagine
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.420]   a flat table.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.100]   It's spinning, a circular disk is spinning with a certain direction.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.500]   All the objects are moving in that same direction due to conservation of this term called angular
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.980]   momentum.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.500]   The sun moves in that, apparently moves in that position.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.960]   Obviously we're rotating around the sun, but it looks like the sun's coming around us.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.500]   The moon is, Jupiter.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.140]   So on the day you were born, there's a constellation behind the sun from our perspective that was
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.700]   Libra on September 26.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.500]   And that was the day that you were born.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.340]   That determines the fact that you're a Libra.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.780]   But there's a problem.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.100]   In December where we are now, the sun is actually in a different constellation, the one that
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.020]   doesn't exist according to the zodiac that was created something like 6,000, 5,000 years
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.020]   ago.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.020]   It's called Ophiuchus.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.100]   So there's a certain segment of people born in a 17-day stretch in December, late November
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.740]   to early December, that are actually Ophiuchans or Ophiuchuses or whatever.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.100]   So that should obliterate astrology as any semblance of a science, because they didn't
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.780]   even know this constellation existed, and yet something like 12% of all people share
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.220]   that constellation.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.820]   So it's just complete nonsense.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.180]   There's no validity to it.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.620]   Twins that are born on the same day have radically different histories, past, futures, and there's
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.060]   no predictive power to it.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.300]   And that's what science is about, right?
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.180]   You want to make a hypothesis, test it, iterate on it, and have confirmation of it.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.260]   And there's zero, in fact, for astrology.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.540]   In fact, if you'll permit me, a kind of silly story.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.900]   When I was dating my wife, who had become my wife in the beginning, she kind of thought
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   it's fun.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.740]   Maybe we'll go see someone who can tell our fortunes, if we belong together.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.900]   So we went to an astrologer.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   And the astrologer asked me a bunch of questions, "When were you born, obviously?"
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.060]   And, oh, no, she asked me, "What's your sign?"
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.960]   So I said, "I'm a Gemini."
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   And she said, "Okay, cool."
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   And then she told me a bunch of things.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.420]   And at the end, I said, "I just want to double-check," and I was playing kind of a little bit of
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.420]   a jerk sometimes.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.420]   So I said, "I just want to confirm.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.700]   Gemini is born in September.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.140]   I'm born September 9th."
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.480]   She said, "Oh, no, no, that's a Virgo.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.980]   But the same things are going to happen to you anyway."
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.480]   Like, it didn't change her outcome.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.900]   And so in the language of the philosophy of science, Karl Popper, others, it's unfalsifiable,
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.140]   and you cannot be proven right.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.140]   It's so flexible.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.180]   You know, you're going to find challenges.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.780]   The stock market is going to fluctuate.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.580]   Political turmoil will reign.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.380]   They're so flexible, it can accommodate any story.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.900]   And that's a hallmark of non-science or sometimes anti-scientific thinking.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:35.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
