[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Well, we're going back to the Word of God as always, but back in particular to Ephesians
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.520]   after some time off.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.900]   And I need to say a thank you to all the men who so ably preached the Word while I was
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.940]   away for a bit.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:29.320]   But we return to where we left off in Ephesians, chapter 5, and this is a very brief passage,
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.640]   and yet it opens up for us a vast, vast amount of biblical revelation.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:47.180]   It's almost unsearchable in what it maintains in terms of its scope.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.220]   But you'll understand that as I read verses 15 to 17, Ephesians 5:15 to 17.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.320]   "Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise."
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.140]   "Making the most of your time, because the days are evil.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.420]   So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.720]   Here we have the comparison between wisdom and foolishness.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.840]   This is a very, very prominent subject in Scripture.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.640]   In fact, this may be the simplest way to understand it.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.040]   The simplest way to understand the difference between the children of God and the children
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.660]   of the devil.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.440]   The children of God are wise; the children of the devil are foolish.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.300]   It's that simple.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.100]   All real wisdom resides with those who know God, and with those who do not know God, they
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.860]   are bound in folly and foolishness.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.960]   This is the way to understand the difference between the two.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.900]   The difference between a believer and a nonbeliever.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.840]   One possesses wisdom from God; the other is a fool.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.960]   So let's start with the negative aspect of it, and maybe ask the question, "What is a
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   fool?"
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.540]   And the definition is obvious to everyone.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.040]   We can use synonyms to explain the definition of fool.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.280]   We think of it as someone who is ignorant; that is, someone who doesn't know truth, doesn't
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.600]   know reality.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.900]   We can think of a fool as someone who is irresponsible, who is indifferent to the normal responsibilities
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.560]   of life.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.940]   We can think of it as a person who lacks education, lacks insight.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.220]   Or we can go all the way to more familiar words like stupid and moronic, and more pejorative
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.600]   words.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.660]   We all know what a fool is: someone who is without knowledge, without responsibility,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:15.220]   without wisdom, without guidance, someone left to himself in the folly of his own mind.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.020]   That's sort of a general definition with which we can all be familiar.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.480]   But I want to dig a little deeper than just the typical definition, even with those synonyms,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.880]   and show you the real definition.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.380]   I want to show you the real definition of a fool.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.180]   So turn in your Bible to Psalm 14, Psalm 14.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.420]   We're going to have a Bible study this morning, not so much a sermon, but really a Bible study.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.400]   I want to try to help capture for you this marvelous and critical distinction between
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.700]   the wise and the foolish, a distinction, by the way, that is found all throughout Scripture
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.800]   in the Old and the New Testament.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.160]   But let's start with the foundation.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:04.180]   Let's start with the foundational statement about what it is to be a fool, Psalm 14.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.380]   And verse 1 says, "The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.840]   So there is the essential pathology of foolishness, a rejection of God.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.200]   It may not be outward and overt.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.880]   It may be something that you say in the heart.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.440]   But there is in the heart.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.860]   The sense that there is no God.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.580]   That's a theological conclusion.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.640]   There is no God.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.700]   This is the person who can look at the universe in all of its vastness and complexity, in
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.940]   the macro creation and the micro creation, and say, "It was made by no one."
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.940]   This is a person who can acknowledge personhood and personality and intellect and the full
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.320]   range of things.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.480]   He can acknowledge the knowledge of emotions and say, "All of that came from nothing.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.820]   Didn't come from another person."
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.040]   This is the practical atheist who can say, "I acknowledge there is right and wrong in
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   the world.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.000]   I acknowledge there is truth and error in the world.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.440]   I acknowledge that there is the real and the false in the world.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.200]   I acknowledge there are moral laws that are clear across the globe to all.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.820]   I acknowledge that there is no God."
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.820]   He can acknowledge that there is no God.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.780]   He can acknowledge that there are moral laws that are clear across the globe to all.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.080]   He can acknowledge that there is no God.
