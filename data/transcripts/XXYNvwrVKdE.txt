[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   So let's talk about dopamine.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.660]   Most people have heard of dopamine
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.340]   and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits,
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.360]   but actually there's no such thing as a dopamine hit.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.300]   And actually the way that your body uses dopamine
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.640]   is to have a baseline level of dopamine,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.980]   meaning an amount of dopamine that's circulating
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.420]   in your brain and body all the time.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.940]   And that turns out to be important
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.660]   for how you feel generally,
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.860]   whether or not you're in a good mood, motivated, et cetera.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.940]   And you also can experience peaks in dopamine
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.340]   above baseline.
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.220]   But if you remember nothing else from this episode,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.900]   please remember this,
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.220]   that when you experience something
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.580]   or you crave something really desirable,
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.140]   really exciting to you, very pleasurable,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.580]   what happens afterwards
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.580]   is your baseline level of dopamine drops, okay?
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.160]   So these peaks in dopamine,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.940]   they influence how much dopamine
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.220]   will generally be circulating afterward.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.180]   And you might think, "Oh, a big peak in dopamine.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.160]   After that, I'm going to feel even better
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.220]   because I just had this great event."
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.160]   Not the case.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.540]   What actually happens
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.060]   is that your baseline level of dopamine drops.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.100]   And fortunately, most people do not experience
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.980]   or pursue enormous increases in dopamine
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.200]   leading to these severe drops in baseline.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.380]   Many people do, however,
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.760]   and that's what we call addiction.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.260]   When somebody pursues a drug or an activity
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.660]   that leads to huge increases in dopamine,
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.180]   and now you understand that afterward,
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.640]   the baseline of dopamine drops
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.540]   because of depletion of dopamine,
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.380]   the readily releasable pool,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.180]   the dopamine is literally not around to be released.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.500]   And so people feel pretty lousy.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380]   And many people make the mistake
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.920]   of then going and pursuing the dopamine-evoking,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.120]   the dopamine-releasing activity or substance.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.180]   Again, thinking mistakenly
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.960]   that it's going to bring up their baseline.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.200]   It's going to give them that peak again.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.880]   Not only does it not give them a peak,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.080]   their baseline gets lower and lower
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.160]   because they're depleting dopamine more and more and more.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.340]   And we've seen this over and over again.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.520]   When people get addicted to something,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   then they're not achieving much pleasure at all.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.000]   Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   but especially in humans for moving us toward goals
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.760]   and how much dopamine is in our system at any one time
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.640]   compared to how much dopamine was in our system
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.360]   a few minutes ago,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.960]   and how much we remember enjoying
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.020]   a particular experience of the past.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.860]   That dictates your so-called quality of life
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.380]   and your desire to pursue things.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.320]   This is really important.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.400]   Dopamine is a currency
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.720]   and it's the way that you track pleasure.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.480]   It's the way that you track success.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.120]   It's the way that you track
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.040]   whether or not you are doing well or doing poorly.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.120]   And that is subjective.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.480]   But if your dopamine is too low,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   you will not feel motivated.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.280]   If your dopamine is really high,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.480]   you will feel motivated.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.880]   And if your dopamine is somewhere in the middle,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.800]   how you feel depends on whether or not
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.820]   you had higher dopamine a few minutes ago
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.360]   or lower dopamine.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.880]   This is important.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.540]   Your experience of life
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780]   and your level of motivation and drive
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.580]   depends on how much dopamine you have
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.220]   relative to your recent experience.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.680]   This is, again, something that's just not accounted for
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.860]   in the simple language of dopamine hits, okay?
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.980]   A simple way to envision dopamine hits
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.460]   is every time you do something you like,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.020]   you eat a piece of chocolate, dopamine hit.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.740]   You look at your Instagram, dopamine hit.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.020]   You see someone you like, dopamine hit.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.660]   You know, all these things described as dopamine hits
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.740]   neglect the fact that if you scroll social media
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.860]   and you see something you really like, dopamine hit.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.920]   Sure, there's an increase in dopamine.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.500]   But then you get to something else and you go,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.800]   hmm, not that interesting.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.660]   However, had you arrived at that second thing first,
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.900]   you might think that it was really interesting.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.660]   If you had arrived to that second Instagram post
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.660]   three days later or four days later,
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.060]   you might find it extremely interesting.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.380]   Again, how much dopamine you experience from something
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.420]   depends on your baseline level of dopamine
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.420]   when you arrive there and your previous dopamine peaks, okay?
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.740]   That's super important to understand.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.220]   And it's completely neglected
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.300]   by the general language of dopamine hits.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.820]   This is why when you repeatedly engage in something
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.260]   that you enjoy, your threshold for enjoyment
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.060]   goes up and up and up.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.500]   Dopamine is this universal currency.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.940]   It establishes value based on
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.580]   not just what you're experiencing in the moment,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.980]   but what you experienced in the days and minutes before.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.780]   Now that you understand how your previous level of dopamine
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.060]   relates to your current level of dopamine
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.580]   and how your current level of dopamine
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.860]   will influence your future level of dopamine,
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.940]   it should become obvious why things like pornography,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.020]   not just the accessibility of pornography,
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.660]   but the intensity of pornography
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.980]   can negatively shape real world
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.060]   romantic and sexual interactions.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.400]   This is a serious concern.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.580]   The discussion is happening now.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.640]   The underlying neurobiological mechanisms,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.180]   you now understand.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.260]   And this isn't to pass judgment on whether or not
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.100]   people like or don't like pornography.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.300]   That's an ethical discussion.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.380]   It's a moral discussion that has to be decided
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.680]   for each individual by virtue of age, et cetera.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.860]   But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.500]   will make it harder to achieve the same level.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.940]   And certainly the greater level of dopamine
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.220]   through a subsequent interaction.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.780]   So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.860]   And yes, indeed,
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.220]   many people who regularly indulge in pornography
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.500]   experience challenges in real world romantic interactions.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.940]   You now understand the mechanisms
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.340]   behind what I'm telling you.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.780]   You can even see this with video games.
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.340]   People will play a video game.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.460]   They love it.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.180]   It's super exciting to them.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.740]   And then they'll keep playing and playing and playing.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.060]   And either one of two things happens, typically both.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.220]   First of all, we say addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.660]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.620]   So oftentimes what will happen is the person
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.140]   only has excitement and can achieve dopamine release
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.220]   to the same extent doing that behavior
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.660]   and not other behaviors.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.060]   And so they start losing interest in school.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.420]   They start losing interest in relationships.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.820]   They start losing interest in fitness and wellbeing.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.500]   And it depletes their life.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.980]   And eventually what typically happens
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.740]   is they will stop getting dopamine release
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.740]   from that activity as well.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.620]   And then they drop into a pretty serious depression
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.180]   and this can get very severe.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.140]   And people have committed suicide
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.180]   from these sorts of patterns of activity.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.020]   Just very briefly,
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.620]   because it was also covered in the interview episode
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.300]   I did with Anna Lembke about addiction.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.980]   Some of you might be asking,
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.420]   what should I do if I experience a drop
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.620]   in my baseline level of dopamine
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.420]   because of engagement with some activity
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.900]   or some substance that led to big peaks?
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   Just to put some color and example on this,
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.900]   a few episodes ago,
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.180]   I talked about a friend who I've known a long time.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.740]   This is actually the child of a friend
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.340]   who has basically become addicted to video games.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.020]   He decided actually after seeing that episode with Anna
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.220]   to do a 30-day complete fast from phone,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.260]   from video games and from social media of all kinds.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.700]   He's now at day 29.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.820]   He's really accomplished this.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.220]   Not incidentally, his levels of concentration,
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.340]   his overall mood are up.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.700]   He's doing far, far better.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.900]   What he did is hard
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.420]   in particular the first 14 days is really hard.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.580]   But the way that you replenish
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.620]   the releasable pool of dopamine
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.900]   is to not engage in these dopaminergic seeking behaviors.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.660]   Because remember, typically people arrive at a place
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.900]   where they want to stop engaging in these behaviors
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.940]   or ingesting substances when that dopamine is depleted,
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.460]   when they're not getting the same lift.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.040]   In his case, he was feeling depressed.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.340]   He thought he had ADHD.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.220]   They were starting to treat it as ADHD.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.980]   And certainly there are people out there who have ADHD,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.900]   but what he found was
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.500]   that his levels of concentration are back.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   He does not need to be treated for ADHD.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.860]   And actually the psychiatrist wondered
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.860]   if he did prior to this video game, social media fast.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.700]   He's feeling good.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.300]   He's exercising again.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.380]   I'm not making this up.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.680]   This is really a very specific,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.140]   but very relevant example
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.460]   of how the dopamine system can replenish itself.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.980]   Of course, if there's a clinical need for ADHD treatment,
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.520]   by all means pursue that.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.120]   But I think a lot of ADHD does go misdiagnosed
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.700]   because of this depletion in dopamine that occurs
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.780]   because of overindulgence and other activities
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.460]   in the drop in baseline.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.500]   So for anyone that's experienced a real drop in baseline
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.980]   who has addictive tendencies,
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.640]   whether or not they're behaviors or substances,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.780]   that is always going to be the path forward
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.700]   is going to be either cold turkey
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.580]   or through some sort of tapering to limit interactions
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.180]   with what would otherwise be the dopamine evoking behavior
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.180]   or substance.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.860]   So if I were to just put a really simple message
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.620]   around dopamine, it would be,
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.680]   there's a molecule in your brain and body
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   that when released tends to make you look outside yourself,
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.440]   pursue things outside yourself
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.520]   and to crave things outside yourself.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.880]   The pleasure that arrives from achieving things
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.240]   also involves dopamine,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.500]   but is mainly the consequence of other molecules.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.080]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.660]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.240]   (upbeat music)
