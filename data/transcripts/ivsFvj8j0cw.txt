[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I love having elite status with airlines and hotels, because who doesn't want to be treated
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.440]   like a VIP every time you travel?
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.360]   Getting upgraded to first class, skipping long security lines, staying in a massive
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.580]   suite, getting free breakfast, not paying bag fees, resort fees, or seat selection fees,
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.580]   and a lot more.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960]   But it can take spending tens of thousands of dollars, flying around the world multiple
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.360]   times, or staying as many as 100 nights a year in a hotel.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.360]   But today, I am going to share some insider tricks and give you 11 different ways to get
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.280]   that elite status and be treated like royalty on your next trip without all the time, money,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.280]   and effort.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.800]   Greg, thanks for being here.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.640]   It's great to be here, Chris.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.120]   We're laughing because we had to do a little bit of a retake because for some reason, nothing
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.560]   recorded for the first five minutes.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.640]   Hey, if it's worth doing once, it's worth doing again.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.840]   So we're going to talk about elite status.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.720]   And I want to just kick off with, what is it?
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.360]   Why is it valuable?
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.360]   How do you get it?
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.560]   In a way, it's a marketing ploy by big companies, by airlines and hotel programs, for example,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.800]   to get their best customers to keep coming back.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.640]   So what they do is when you're a good customer, they award you with a low level of elite status.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   And then when you're a better customer, they award you with next level elite status and
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.720]   so on.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.720]   Most of these companies have three or four, sometimes even five levels of status.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.640]   And the idea is that at each level, when you reach elite status, the idea is that next
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.940]   time you are a customer with that hotel or airline, you get treated better.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.480]   Maybe with an airline, for example, you might get free seat selection into like comfort
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.880]   plus or the economy plus type of seating, or you might get onto the upgrade list for
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.800]   first class for free and you have a chance of getting upgraded.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.560]   With hotels, it's things like room upgrades, sometimes to suites, sometimes it's things
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.600]   like free breakfast and other perks.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080]   How do you typically qualify for these statuses?
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.760]   Because they're not giving them away for free.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.100]   No, they're not.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.240]   With airlines, it used to be about how far you flew.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.840]   So they would actually measure like how many miles you'd fly each year and the lowest level
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.440]   status would be like 25,000 miles flown and the next level might be 50,000 and top tier
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.360]   was usually around 100,000 miles flown, which is a heck of a lot.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480]   For anyone who doesn't know, that's what, four times around the world, probably at least
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.160]   40 times across the country.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.880]   And so of course they want to, they wanted to encourage those great customers to come
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.400]   back by giving them lots of perks.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.160]   The problem was that there was a whole game in finding the cheapest, longest distance
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   flights.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.560]   And so people would do things called miles running, where they would earn status by booking,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.320]   let's say a $300 flight to Asia that had like eight different stops along the way.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.480]   So they're pinging back and forth in all these different ways and every, every segment is
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.280]   adding distance and so it's, it's you can build a really long flight for a cheap price.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.760]   And at some point the airlines realized that's not the type of customer they really wanted
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   to reward.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.440]   They want to reward the customers that are spending the most with them.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.320]   And so almost all of them have switched to a model of rewarding based on how much you
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.280]   spend with the airline as opposed to how far you fly.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   Now the hotels are fortunately still giving you status based on nights, so there's a little
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   bit of gaming.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.960]   If you find super cheap nights, mattress runs instead of mileage runs.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.320]   Has anything else evolved with the way hotels handle things?
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   No, you're right.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.600]   I mean, they've, they've kept that.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.000]   One thing that's evolved for the better for those of us that are into miles and points
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.920]   is that most of them now will, when you're on an awards day, you've booked a hotel free
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.120]   night with points or with a free night certificate.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.680]   That usually does count as an eligible night towards elite status.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.080]   It used to be that, that they often didn't count.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.500]   Actually, that's been great for people like you and I, who do a lot of awards.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   Exactly.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.160]   And what on the airline side, can you use your points to fly and also earn status?
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.080]   Sometimes.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.780]   So that's a fairly new phenomenon with Delta and United.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:31.620]   When you use your miles to fly on those airlines, they treat each, every hundred miles spent
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.200]   as like a dollar, so like a hundred pennies.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.680]   And so they treat it like that.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.260]   So it counts as if you spent money and so it adds to your elite status that way.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.820]   So in some way, that's an improvement for miles and points people, if you're trying
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.420]   to get status that way.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.300]   What we're going to talk about today is mostly ways to get status without having to put in
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.640]   as much work as you might spending.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   Let's see.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.780]   I'm going to guess somewhere on the order of five to 20, 25, $30,000 is about what I
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.580]   imagine these airlines are looking for you to spend to get their status across all these
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.580]   tiers.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.580]   That's, that's totally fair.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.580]   It's in that range.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.700]   Unless you're going for some of these kind of invite only statuses, there's concierge
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.100]   key on American 360 on Delta and global services on United.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.340]   I know for a while, the global services threshold, everyone kind of, it wasn't published, but
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.040]   it was like spend more than $50,000.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.460]   So there are some of these invite only statuses with even more perks, but you really need
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.400]   to be spending a lot and best.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.780]   I know there is no way to game your way into them.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.180]   That's why I've never, never investigated them too much because you have to actually
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.800]   do the spend as far as I know to get into this.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.540]   And today we're going to talk about how to not do the spend and get there.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.220]   Anything that you think people might not realize isn't included when you get these different
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.380]   levels of elite status?
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.220]   I mean, one thing that you might not realize with airline elite status is that at least
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:06.660]   the low level levels of status aren't going to get you into the airlines airport lounge.
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.340]   Even at the high level, it's not usually a set benefit as much as something that you
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.020]   can get as like a milestone reward that you can choose, but at the expense of other things,
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.180]   like you might give up global upgrade certificates if you choose to get lounge access.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.620]   So there's a trade off there.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.620]   And you mentioned upgrade certificates.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.320]   And I think it's important that people understand just because you have status doesn't mean
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.460]   you're getting upgraded.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.740]   I know I have the bottom tier of status on United and since having United silver, I've
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.060]   never been upgraded.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.340]   I am consistently somewhere around 100 on the upgrade list.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.540]   And there's usually like eight seats available.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:52.580]   So unless you really hit, I would say that 75 to 125,000 level, which now is really based
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.580]   on dollars.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.900]   But the former, the top one or two tiers, I wouldn't expect you're getting a lot of
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.500]   upgrades on an airline if you're flying from their hub.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   Now, maybe if you're flying other routes, but from San Francisco, you're probably never
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.020]   getting an upgraded on United at silver.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.020]   Right.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   And that's the key.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.700]   You have to be like top tier to hope to get those upgrades.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.020]   And but if you're flying from a smaller airport, you might find that bottom level silver, silver
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.780]   status does get you nice upgrades.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.860]   It certainly has happened to me having United silver flying out of Detroit, which is a Delta
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.860]   hub and only has like five or six United flights.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.700]   I have gotten upgraded.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.820]   But but these are for short, like nothing flights like it's not that exciting.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.380]   It's like a regional jet where you're getting upgraded to like a little leg room.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.980]   And so you get, you know, so, yeah, so you're in a nicer seat for like an hour and a half
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:57.100]   and then you land and maybe the service includes a drink.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.740]   And how do the airline alliances fit into status?
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.860]   So, yeah, this is a great thing about alliances.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.180]   So there are three major airline alliances.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.020]   There's Star Alliance, which United and Air Canada are part of.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.900]   There's One World, which American and Alaska are part of.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.720]   And by the way, I'm just mentioning a couple.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.340]   Yeah, there's like 20 to 30 plus airlines.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:31.180]   And then there's Sky Team, which regionally you have Delta and Aeromexico.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:38.540]   And within these alliances, when you when you earn status with your with a particular
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.060]   airline that's in that alliance, you also can earn alliance status.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.340]   So where that's really nice is with things like Star Alliance.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.820]   If you get Star Alliance gold status, which usually goes along with like, let's say you
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.460]   get United gold status.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.820]   That'll also give you Star Alliance gold status.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.900]   And then that'll mean when you're flying outside of the United States on a Star Alliance carrier,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.420]   you'll have access to the to whatever the Star Alliance lounge is when you're flying
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.420]   there.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.860]   And you usually, if I remember right, get a few other perks, like maybe some free checked
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.740]   bags on the carriers in the alliance, maybe priority boarding or security, but probably
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.420]   not upgrades.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.420]   That's true.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.420]   And it can be valuable.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.140]   I've had times where I had a temporary Star Alliance gold status from a status match once.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:44.940]   And you know, I went into an airline, it was I think I was flying Ethiopian in Africa and
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.140]   there were huge lines, but I saw the Star Alliance gold security line.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.100]   I'm like, Oh, I'll go over there.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.100]   Just breathe, breathe through.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.100]   And that was great.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.820]   And then to get in the lounge, too, and I was just flying economy.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.160]   So it was great.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.620]   Super helpful, especially because a lot of us are so used to TSA pre and clear and you
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.620]   go overseas.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.620]   Not there.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:11.300]   So what I want to do today is I wrote a list of about 11 different ways, some of this from
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.660]   just watching your content, that you can shortcut this process and you can get elite status
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.180]   without having to put in all the effort, as well as after that, we'll talk a little bit
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.340]   about some ways that you might get a lot of these perks without even worrying about elite
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.340]   status.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.680]   So I think the first one I'll start with is just having a credit card.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.020]   Can just having a credit card get you elite status on airlines and hotel groups, or do
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.780]   you really need to spend a lot?
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:44.240]   There's plenty of opportunities to have hotel elite status from just having a credit card.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.600]   Off the top of my head, I can't remember if there's any good airline elite statuses you
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.160]   have with a credit card, unless you're thinking of the American Express Centurion.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.900]   Yes, that was the one that came to mind because I have one friend who has it and he's like,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.700]   I get Delta Platinum status by having American Express Centurion and I'm like, that's awesome.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.780]   It also comes with an annual fee that's like $7,500 or something, and an initiation fee
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:14.980]   that's like $5,000 so I'm not sure that's a great trade off, but at least for me, it
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.980]   exists.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.340]   And then I said, have a credit card.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.200]   I believe if you have two credit cards, you could earn yourself some Delta status.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.060]   Delta has Delta Platinum card and they have a Delta Reserve card and each of them will
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:35.540]   give you a $2,500 MQD headstart just by having the card.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.240]   And an MQD is Medallion Qualifying Dollars.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:46.260]   And so the idea is just by having the card, Delta acts as if you've spent $2,500 with
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.840]   Delta.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:57.180]   And so first level Silver status with Delta, this year anyway, requires 5,000 MQDs total.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:03.900]   So if you have two Delta cards, you'll have those two headstarts, you'll have 5,000 MQDs
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.620]   and boom, you've got Silver status just by holding those two cards.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.700]   No flights.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   No flights.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.300]   And if you were to get both the personal and business version of the Platinum and the Reserve
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.100]   card, you could conceivably get your way to Gold status, but it would use up a lot of
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.140]   your Amex card slots.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.140]   That's right.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.140]   That's right.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.620]   Amex doesn't want you to have more than five credit cards and these are credit cards as
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.980]   opposed to like charge cards or pay over time cards.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.420]   And so that would use up four out of your five slots.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.300]   So you wouldn't be able to then also have more than one Marriott or Hilton card, for
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.580]   example, with Amex.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:46.640]   So with a few cards, like the Marriott Brilliant card, which these cards, by the way, all typically
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.460]   have annual fees kind of in the ballpark of hundreds of dollars, you can get Marriott
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.140]   Platinum and with the Hilton Aspire, you can get Hilton Diamond.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:01.860]   And then I would say all of the entry tier hotel statuses, which don't get you a lot,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.860]   are very easy to get.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:10.100]   There are lots of cards that will give you, you know, Marriott Gold or Silver even, which
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.100]   is really not worth it.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.140]   I even forgot about it because I feel like I don't even know what it would get you.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.020]   You might score a bottle of water in a hotel that doesn't normally give those out.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.300]   But Hyatt is a tricky one.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.620]   I don't think you can get status with just having a card or can you get the base tier?
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:31.100]   I think they do give you Discoverist, which is Hyatt's bottom tier, which is really not
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.420]   worth aspiring to.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:40.220]   OK, so so cards will make it easy to get status way more on hotels and airlines.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.500]   But that top tier of status on airlines is going to be almost impossible by just having
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.940]   a card, even on Delta.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.940]   Right.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.780]   And when it comes to Hyatt and IHG, you can't just get a card and get the status.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   Is that right?
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.780]   That's right.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.380]   Now, Marriott does have a higher tier of status than Platinum, so you can't get all the way
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.740]   to their top level like you can with Hilton.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.700]   But the real big benefits on Marriott come from getting to Platinum, where you start
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.940]   to get free breakfast and those things.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   I do.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.980]   I do think there is one bonus that I don't know where I couldn't figure out where to
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.100]   fit in this narrative.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:21.300]   But if you get to Marriott Titanium status, you do get free United Silver status, which
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.380]   is a great perk that I've had in the past.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.460]   But you got to go do 75 nights.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.580]   And the nights you earn, unfortunately, from a lot of these cards, the status you earn
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.060]   from these cards does not necessarily count towards your nights towards the next level.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.980]   So you might get a free Marriott Platinum with the Brilliant card, but you still need
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.420]   to get to 75 nights to get to the next to get to the next.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.420]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.360]   And that's that's a common question we get all the time, like, hey, I got I got free
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.060]   gold status because I have the Amex Platinum card, let's say so.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:00.340]   Does that give me, you know, so do I have to do fewer nights to get to the next level?
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.700]   And no, no, it doesn't.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:09.140]   However, the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card, which gives you platinum status outright.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.540]   It's true that that platinum status doesn't give you a leg up towards the next level up
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.220]   of titanium.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:23.060]   But the card also gives you 25 nights towards elite status each year.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:30.140]   So just by having that card, you know, you're 25 nights into the 75 nights you would need
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.580]   for titanium status right there and a lot of the same thing, like the Delta.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.980]   If you just have one Delta card, you don't have status, but you get a little bit of a
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.980]   head start.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.980]   Right.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.380]   And that dovetails perfectly to the next step, which is to spend on the credit cards.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.480]   So a lot of these cards might give you a little bit of your way there.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.500]   But if you spend enough, you can get all your way there.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.180]   Some make this easier than others.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.240]   What would you say on the airline front?
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.900]   Who makes it the easiest?
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.500]   So I would have previously said American Airlines makes it the easiest.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.100]   But right now it's it's sort of a neck and neck race between AA and Delta.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.620]   They both make it pretty easy to do that through spend right now.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:16.380]   On the flip side, you have United, where United makes it possible to spend your way to status.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.300]   But you have to spend like an order of magnitude more with United to get the same level of
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.100]   status that you could get with AA or Delta.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.700]   So on American, you know, it's anywhere from thirty five thousand on the low end with with
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.020]   the right card all the way up to like two hundred thousand on Delta.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.860]   It's from zero, like we mentioned, with the right cards all the way up to like two hundred
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.460]   thirty two hundred fifty thousand, depending on how many cards you have.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.980]   And then on United top tier status, you have to spend four hundred and eighty thousand
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980]   dollars.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   To get there.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.980]   And on the low end, you have to spend one hundred thousand dollars.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.980]   Right.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:49.980]   Right.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.980]   So that's where you've got an order of magnitude higher.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.980]   So that's that's amazing.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.740]   If you think about Delta where you could spend zero or or let's say you just have two Delta
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:03.300]   cards, then you're spending, what, five thousand to get to that first level versus what you
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.300]   say?
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   One hundred thousand.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   One hundred thousand on United.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.060]   You know, I mean, obviously, United's not as interested as American and Delta are in
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.060]   encouraging the credit card spend by through elite status anyway.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.800]   It seems United really wants you to fly on airplanes and they're the only one that still
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.180]   has a requirement of like number of segments flown.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.060]   You have a minimum number of segments you have to fly with United to to keep status
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.100]   where the others you could totally get status without ever flying.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.580]   And then two other airlines worth calling out.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.220]   So JetBlue will let you spend your way towards status.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:42.580]   I think at an order I didn't do the math, but you need 50 to 250 tiles and each tile
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.220]   costs a thousand dollars of spend.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.020]   So 50 to two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.680]   So kind of on the same same order of magnitude, but with a lot less flexibility because they
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.280]   just don't have as many partners as all the other airlines and they don't fly as many
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   places.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.860]   And then the other is Southwest.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.040]   While you can't spend your way, I guess you can spend your way, I think, to a list, but
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.560]   it's it's hard.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.480]   You can very easily spend your way, especially with the help of signup bonuses to companion
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.120]   pass, which funny enough, is on a different track than a list.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.420]   It's like you you can every dollar you earn on your credit card or your Southwest points
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.420]   from just flying.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.860]   They all count towards companion pass.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.260]   If you get three hundred and thirty five thousand Southwest points, you get companion pass and
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.860]   you can nominate one person and that person can fly for free other than taxes all the
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.460]   year you earn it and the next year.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.860]   And I think that is actually a distinction we didn't bring up.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.660]   Usually when you earn a status, you get it for that year and the following year.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.620]   So if you time it well and you're able to earn it in January on Southwest, for example,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.740]   you would get to have a companion for the whole year and the whole next year.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.620]   And because welcome bonuses count towards that right now, for example, the Southwest
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.580]   cards are doing an eighty five thousand point welcome bonus that gets you more than halfway
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.760]   towards companion pass.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.760]   You're really close.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.180]   And having a card also takes ten thousand points off the requirement for companion pass.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.780]   So, yeah, it really makes it easy.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:19.860]   And so I know a lot of couples who will every two years alternate who signs up for two companion
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.140]   or two Southwest cards right at the end of the year so that they'll complete the spend
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.860]   for the sign up bonus in January.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.340]   Then you know, they'll have the companion pass then for the rest of that calendar year
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.500]   and all of the next and then their spouse does it two years later and they keep altering.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.980]   It is a very common points thing.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.380]   You guys have a whole article on it that I'll link to in the show notes about how to achieve
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.380]   companion pass.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.220]   But man, if you are anywhere near a bunch of Southwest flights, it is an awesome status
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   to have.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.580]   Doesn't really get you any priority boarding, doesn't really get you any feature other than
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.980]   a free companion, but no one else is doing that.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.760]   It's super valuable for sure.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.880]   And then on the hotel front, we talked about how, you know, Marriott makes it easy to get
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.360]   to Platinum Diamond on Hilton is as easy as getting the Aspire card.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.200]   So I don't want to spend too much time.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.480]   Yes, you could probably spend money on cards and earn status, right?
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.760]   But I think the coveted status is Hyatt Globalist, which, you know, best I know, I've never actually
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   had it.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.120]   It is the best status to have in the hotel world, but you can't just get it for free.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.480]   Can you spend your way to get it?
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   Yeah, you can.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.680]   Well, let's first say why it's so coveted.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.120]   I think Hyatt does a better job than the other chains of making sure that their individual
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.460]   hotels actually fulfill the promise of elite status.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.760]   You can then go to any Hyatt and you can be pretty confident you really are going to get
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.680]   free breakfast, which contrasts greatly with Marriott, where at Platinum status, you're
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.000]   supposed to get free breakfast.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:05.720]   But there are so many clauses to that statement that we made a chart showing, you know, are
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.520]   you going to get free breakfast?
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.200]   And what does it mean at all these different brands with Marriott?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.680]   But even if you know whether or not you're supposed to get free breakfast with a particular
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.880]   brand with Marriott, Marriott doesn't do a great job of making sure that the individual
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.640]   hotels adhere to that.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:28.000]   So often they'll just kind of opt out or give you a certificate for $10 at the coffee shop
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   or that.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.360]   And they're like, "Yeah, we have a beautiful buffet.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.240]   You get $10 so you can get a coffee and a bagel."
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.960]   Probably not a bagel, maybe a croissant.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.000]   There are Hyatt hotels that'll play games like that, but I just feel like overall Hyatt
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.680]   does a better job of managing that.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:48.160]   More than that, some of the benefits they guarantee are just so valuable.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.200]   Things like free parking on award stays, which can be incredibly valuable, especially in
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   big cities.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:03.960]   I mean, imagine easily saving $70 to $100 a night in New York City or LA.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   Or San Francisco.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Or San Francisco.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   Or San Francisco.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.600]   My dad had a really early doctor's appointment at UCSF and he's like, "We just want to stay
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   in the city.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   We don't have to drive in."
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.080]   And they stayed at a Marriott.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.320]   He has titanium status.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.480]   And that parking was still somewhere around $90.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.040]   Yeah, because Marriott doesn't have that benefit, but Hyatt does.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.960]   Another one that Hyatt has is on paid stays, no resort fees.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:35.840]   So Hyatt does not charge resort fees at all if you book a stay with points.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.040]   Hilton also doesn't do that with points.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.920]   Marriott does though.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.880]   But Hyatt also, on a paid stay, if you have top tier status, you're not going to pay the
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.520]   resort fee, which at some hotels can be absolutely massive.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.640]   Especially if you're staying for a week and all that stuff.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:23:00.000]   Well, I mean, there are high-end resorts that cost $1,000, $2,000 a night where their resort
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.800]   fee is a percentage.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   It's like 20%.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   Oh, I've never seen one of those.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.600]   So you're talking really big money and it's all waived.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.600]   That's awesome.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.760]   I think that in one of two ways, you get some headstart with some of the cards, right?
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.040]   If you sign up for the Hyatt business or personal card.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.080]   The personal card will give you five late nights each year.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.520]   So you're five out of 60 there to top tier.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.640]   But if you spend, you can get yourself there, I think it's about $100,000.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.640]   Does that sound right?
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.680]   If you have both cards and you spend them optimally, because one of them gives you a
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   headstart.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.560]   The other one gives you a little bit of a faster way there while spending.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   That's right.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:43.960]   So the personal card will give you two elite nights for every $5,000 you spend.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.560]   So there you're talking about closer to $120,000 spend, but then you've got to subtract out
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.920]   the five you got automatically.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.000]   So whatever that is with the business card, which doesn't give you free nights automatically
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   at all.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.540]   You can also get with $50,000 spend, you'll get a rebate on points, on points bookings
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.080]   for the rest of that year, up to a cap.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.080]   So not only are you earning more elite nights with that spend than you would with the equivalent
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:16.320]   spend on the personal card, but you're also getting that other perk.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.720]   So the ideal combination, if you just want to spend your way to Hyatt Globalist is to
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.360]   spend $15,000 on the personal card, because that $15,000 spend will also get you a second
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   free night.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.680]   Which you can use to kind of get one of your nights towards 60.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.060]   And then the business card $50,000 spend is ideal.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.440]   Yeah, I think I did the math.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.100]   And if you wanted to optimally do it, you'd have to put about $108,000 on those two cards.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:49.580]   Now I want to be clear, this is not a strategy where you just go out and spend $108,000.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.260]   A friend of mine actually did this, he had a big tax bill, and he split it out over the
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.660]   course of the year on a Hyatt card, or actually, I think he only did it on one.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.460]   So maybe he ended up spending $110,000.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:06.720]   But that $110,000 cost him, let's call it round up a little bit to 2% of fees.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.980]   So he spent about $2,000.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:15.460]   He got Hyatt Globalist, but he also got 100,000 Hyatt points, which depending on how you want
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.260]   to value them could be anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 also.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:26.740]   And so he kind of basically pre-bought 100,000 Hyatt points and got free Globalist by paying
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.340]   a lot of tax bills on his credit card.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.220]   If you were just out for the points, you'd be better off doing a Chase Ultimate Rewards
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.020]   card that earns 1.5 points per dollar everywhere.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:42.180]   The Freedom Unlimited or the Ink Business Unlimited, because those can be transferred
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:49.420]   to Hyatt one-to-one, so you'd earn a lot more Hyatt points that way, 50% more.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:55.500]   But it wouldn't give you the status, and so if the status is important to you, then that's
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   great.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.500]   The other thing to mention is Hyatt also has these milestone rewards.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.220]   So when you get 20 nights, 30 nights, 40 nights, 50 nights, 60 nights, 70 nights, etc., each
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:13.860]   time you sometimes get an automatic reward and sometimes you get to pick in addition
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.500]   to the automatic one, you get to pick something.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.820]   So those have value too.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:26.480]   So your friend not only got all those Hyatt points, but he also got upgrade certificates.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.340]   He got some extra free nights.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:38.940]   He got Guest of Honor awards, which can be used to, if you don't have Globalist yet and
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.060]   you get a Guest of Honor award, it can be used to upgrade your own stay to a Globalist
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:49.060]   stay and you get the free parking, free breakfast, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:55.700]   Or if you have a friend who you want to give Globalist status to for a stay, you could
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.440]   give them that Guest of Honor award.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:03.020]   An interesting point you made in a recent episode was around Hyatt status and I'd always
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.140]   thought, "Okay, I'm going to go for Globalist because I've got some spending to do for taxes
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.140]   this year."
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.940]   And then I realized, "Well, I'm probably only staying once or twice a year at a Hyatt."
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:18.800]   And so to go all the way to Globalist might not actually be worth it because at 40 nights,
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.540]   you get this Guest of Honor coupon that you can use for yourself to give yourself Globalist
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.540]   for a stay.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.540]   Right, right.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.200]   And you can also get a few Club Access awards, so you can use those.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.020]   So I'll just caution people that are excited about Globalist, you might not even need it
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.620]   if you're not traveling that much.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.620]   Right.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.760]   At 40 nights, you get both the Guest of Honor and you can pick a suite upgrade award.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:44.680]   And so now, unfortunately, you can't use them on the same stay, but if you have two Hyatt
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:52.440]   stays coming up, one where you'd really benefit with booking at the lowest rate and then upgrading
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:58.240]   to a suite, that would be the perfect use of that suite upgrade certificate.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.520]   And another one where you'd really benefit from all the perks of Globalist, apply your
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.680]   Guest of Honor certificate to that other one.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.380]   So you could have two fantastic stays with what you get at 40 nights.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.200]   And by the way, if you get to 40 nights and then you have two fantastic stays, those stays
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.280]   count towards the nights, so you're probably pretty close now to 60.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.220]   You don't actually need to get all the way to Globalist before you stay.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.960]   You can get to that 40K level and then maybe those nights will get you the rest of the
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   way there.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.400]   So maybe it's actually not 108 because if you're going to do all this, you better be
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   staying at Hyatt.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Exactly.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.980]   I was going to say that earlier that for most people, it doesn't make sense to spend your
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:44.480]   way entirely to it because you want to use your actual stays to help you get there and
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.360]   then you won't have as much spend required.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.160]   If you don't have actual stays at Hyatt, there's no point in doing this at all if you don't
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   have actual stays.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   Okay.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   So that's spending on cards.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.080]   And so that seems to be a way with almost every program you can get your way to status.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.640]   It's just going to cost you a lot with some like United and a lot less with others.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.540]   Can you spend money outside of a card to get status with any of these programs or is it
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.640]   always have to be on one of their cards?
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.920]   So American has a really interesting loyalty program.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.800]   They totally gamified their elite program and what they did is they said almost every
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.920]   time, not every time, but almost every time that you earn an American Airlines mile, you'll
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.440]   also earn something called a loyalty point and it's the loyalty points with American
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.400]   that decide what level of elite status you've attained.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.800]   And so if you think about it with all of these airline and hotel programs, there's multiple
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.200]   ways to earn their points.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.440]   It's not just spend on the credit card.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.040]   It's not just spend with them.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:50.960]   There's also things like there are online shopping portals where you could shop through
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:59.520]   like the Advantage eShopping portal and click through from the portal to shop at like Macy's.com
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.520]   or something.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.080]   And the American Airlines portal might say you'll get five miles per dollar for shopping
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.120]   at Macy's.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.120]   Then let's say you buy something that's a thousand dollars.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.280]   Then you'd get 5,000 American Airlines miles and 5,000 loyalty points.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.060]   So you can do that.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.820]   They also partner with like a, they have a hotel booking engine.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.600]   They have car rentals.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.560]   There's a lot of different things like that where just your normal everyday, I'm about
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.060]   to like, I'm about to spend money online.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.960]   There might be a way of doing it so that you'll get a lot of American Airlines miles and loyalty
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.240]   points towards elite status.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.680]   And now keep in mind for anyone listening, a lot of these other airlines have these same
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   shopping portals.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.800]   They just don't give you anything towards elite status.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.600]   We've talked about how to use cards and spending to get to status and obviously the standard
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   ways.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.680]   You mentioned status match earlier, just very briefly.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.940]   How do status matches work?
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.440]   When do they make sense?
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:05.240]   So status matches, usually the way it works is you are basically saying to an airline,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.680]   you know, Hey, I have been spending all my money with United, but now I want to, I want
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.160]   to try out Delta, but I don't want to start from ground zero.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.040]   I'm used to my elite perks with United.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:25.520]   So Delta then will say, okay, we'll give you a matching status level for usually it's 90
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   days.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.160]   And then there'll be a challenge component to it.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.800]   If you fly a certain amount, and in this case, if you spend a certain amount with Delta in
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:42.040]   that, in those 90 days, while you have this trial status, then you get to keep it, uh,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   for longer.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.480]   And, and, uh, Delta's status match is actually very generous right now.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.680]   It's letting you keep it for the rest of the current calendar year, all of the next and
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.920]   into January of the year after that.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.060]   So that is actually similar to how I got my status.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.020]   So there's status matches, there's status matches that have a challenge component.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.820]   And then sometimes they're just status challenges where I was able to do a challenge to get
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.620]   my United silver status where I didn't have any status at all.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.380]   And it often feels like whatever the requirement for a year is, if you can hit one quarter
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.140]   of that requirement in 90 days, they'll let you keep the status.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.700]   Now the next year you have to do the full requirement, but, um, do you see those pop
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.700]   up a lot?
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.260]   Or was I pretty lucky in finding one?
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.460]   That's very common.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:33.300]   And, um, often if you work for a large corporation, there's often deals with, uh, different brands
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.380]   that where they'll, they'll have open status matches, like what you described for any employee.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.300]   Um, Hyatt will do that with a lot of, uh, businesses.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:50.900]   They'll give you a, a challenge where, um, you have to stay 20 nights within three months,
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.780]   let's say to get a globalist status.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.860]   Now within those status matches, I'll point out that I am pretty sure that none of the
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.460]   tricks we just talked about work.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.940]   So it's not within 90 days, earn 20 nights from your credit card spend or from, you know,
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.460]   other loyalty points.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.920]   You usually in those challenges have to actually do the main way of earning points.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   Almost always.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:17.020]   And, and I mentioned though, uh, Delta's generous status match before Delta's will let spend
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.300]   on their credit cards count towards meeting that match.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   Okay.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.980]   So United will absolutely not absolutely not.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.100]   And Hyatt as well.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.100]   Okay.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.100]   And there's two websites.
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:32.260]   Status matcher is a website that just has a database of all of these different matches.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.340]   Like people report, I got success going from a to B. So you might have success there.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.340]   It's really useful.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.420]   Cause you know, you might be like, Oh, this is the first time I'm going to stay at a,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.180]   I don't know, Wyndham property or something.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.900]   I've got my Hilton status.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.340]   Can I match over?
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:53.260]   And you can check status match or.com to see does, would that work before you waste your
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.260]   time trying to do it?
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.260]   Yep.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.820]   And I'll, I'll point out that usually there's some window where you can't repeat these.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.140]   So if you do a status match because you're about to stay at a Wyndham and you can't keep
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.660]   up that status and you're not going to probably be able to do it again next year.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.660]   That's true.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.460]   There's two reasons you might want to do a status match.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:17.980]   One might be because you really think you're going to meet the challenge and keep the status
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:23.500]   longer because you really are going to start you know, flying that airline or staying in
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.140]   that hotel brand more.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.080]   The other reason is that you have a big trip coming up and you want to have elite status
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   for that trip.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:36.140]   And so you do that challenge and, and then you have that trade off of saying, well, okay,
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.700]   I'm going to do this challenge now, but depending on the rules of the particular program, it
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.020]   might be five years before I can do another one.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.020]   Yep.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:49.740]   And you often can't match a free status to a challenge.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.740]   Is that right?
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.620]   Like if I got United Silver from having Marriott Titanium, I couldn't match my United Silver
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.060]   to a Delta status if I got it for free from Marriott.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.460]   Technically you're not supposed to, but it, it often works.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.460]   Okay.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.420]   They'll often ask you for the history, your history.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.300]   So not just, not just a picture of like your screen showing that you have a certain level
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:19.180]   of status, but also in the case of airlines, like your, your flying history with that airline
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.380]   that you're matching from.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.140]   And I've done that.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:29.100]   I've matched from Delta to others where all of my Delta history or almost all of it was
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:36.660]   all like award flights, um, or earning, um, earning elite status from credit card spend.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.260]   And that's all in my like transaction history.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.700]   And they still like, they just see a pile of stuff and they don't know what it is.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.700]   Okay.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.460]   And so it's, so it's, it's worth trying for sure.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.460]   Awesome.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.660]   I mean, I guess a big theme that I hear you guys always talk about on your show is, but
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.420]   it doesn't hurt to try like the worst thing.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.420]   They just say no.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.300]   It's amazing how many times it just works, even if you just try.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.780]   And separate from status matches and challenges, sometimes they're just offers.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.920]   So there was an offer a few weeks ago that was on Southwest, which I feel like they've
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.140]   done one or two of these a year, the past few years, which is fly around trip flight
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:17.460]   and get companion pass for three months, fly to Hawaii, get companion pass for right.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.960]   Two months, that kind of stuff.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.480]   I don't know why Southwest keeps doing this, but there, there have been a handful of times
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:29.520]   where just taking one round trip flight would net you at least a couple months of companion
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   pass.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.740]   They do it because they think they're going to encourage more, you know, flying more revenue
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.060]   than they would without it.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.820]   So, you know, once you get that companion pass, you're very much incentivized to, to
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.940]   fly Southwest instead of the competition.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.940]   That's fair.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.380]   And then every now and then there's, and maybe this is kind of a similar thing to what we
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:54.620]   described with a challenge, but I know if you get to built platinum, you get Air France
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:59.780]   KLM flying blue status, um, I think for a year and I don't think it's a challenge and
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.040]   that you don't have to do anything.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.700]   So it's kind of a promotion, but it's not forever.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   Right.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   And it's not automatic.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:11.380]   It's like you have to, I think you have to transfer some, uh, points to Air France KLM
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.340]   to trigger that you'll get that status for a year.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   Exactly.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.820]   We have an Air France flight coming up this summer and I'm like, is it worth doing this?
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.600]   I mean, we might have to change our flights and whatever status it matches to does not
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.660]   waive change fees on Air France, which is what I was really hoping for.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   Right.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   Right.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.260]   Um, and, and by the way, I, I don't know if we mentioned this before, but in general,
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.820]   if you're, if you're flying, um, you know, regional first class or international business
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:43.820]   class on any of these airlines, most of these elite benefits aren't going to help you at
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.580]   all because you're already getting all the, all the perks you're getting.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.500]   You're already upfront, you're, you're already in boarding group, at least close to boarding
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.500]   group one.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.620]   The really, the only thing at that point that helps sometimes you could get, um, change
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.900]   fees waived.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.780]   You could get, uh, and sometimes you get special treatment.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.260]   You just wrote a post about getting bumped from business class on an airline that I don't
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.260]   think you had status on.
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.260]   Is that right?
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.260]   That's right.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.260]   That's right.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.260]   Had you had status on that airline?
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.420]   I'm sure I would not have gotten bumped.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.420]   That's right.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:20.900]   I was flying Lufthansa using miles from, from, uh, Avianca life miles had booked a, a Lufthansa
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.380]   business class ticket.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.020]   I got bumped to premium economy.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:30.520]   Um, some speculate that, you know, that like, why was I picked?
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:35.860]   Some speculate, and I don't know if this is true, that maybe from Lufthansa's point of
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:41.080]   view, I might've been on the cheapest business class ticket on the plane, right?
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.580]   But had you had Lufthansa status linked to that flight?
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.580]   I'm guessing.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.580]   Sure.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.580]   They would have left you, let you stay in that business class seat.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.580]   Bump somebody else.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   So Marriott actually has a, uh, guarantee.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:56.260]   So if you have elite status, um, and you get walked, they, they promise you all kinds of
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.660]   points and things.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.660]   Um, but there's also like, what will the hotel that walks you do for you?
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:11.020]   Uh, so one time we were walked in Germany in Baden-Baden from the Marriott there.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.980]   And the email we got said that they were going to put us up at, at this all suites hotel.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.820]   And I look it up, it's bad reviews.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.180]   It's, it's a cheap hotel.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.900]   Like it's, it's like half the price of the, the one we had booked.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.540]   Um, so I researched what's the best hotel in Baden-Baden and I found one that looked
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.960]   amazing.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.540]   And so I wrote back and said, you know, Hey, we were really looking forward to staying
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:39.260]   at the room, Rumors Baden-Baden, uh, cause of what a great, you know, a reputation you
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.260]   have.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.660]   And we'd expect you to put us up at an equally good hotel.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.860]   And I named the other one and they did it.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   Wow.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.980]   And in fact, uh, we were in a fairly large group.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:56.140]   One of the rooms that we had confirmed was a suite for, um, four people in one room.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.500]   And uh, they put them up in a suite at this other hotel.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.420]   It was probably much more expensive, much more expensive.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.420]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.420]   Okay.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.460]   So a few last ways to get status.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.700]   So one, you can get it gifted to you.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.060]   Uh, there are a lot of statuses that let you give other people status and I know you've
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.700]   had high tier Delta status.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.180]   So every year you could choose to give someone status.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.700]   In fact, uh, high tier Delta will let you gift two people now.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:29.620]   Like, so Delta gives you a one choice benefit when you become platinum and three when you
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.620]   become diamond.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:37.540]   So at platinum you can, um, you can, you can use your choice benefit to gift two people
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.540]   Delta silver status.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:46.220]   Um, and at, uh, diamond, you could use one of your three choice benefits to gift, uh,
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.060]   two people gold status.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.220]   So that's pretty good.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.540]   One of the other cool ones, which isn't really gifting, but when you hit a million miles
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:58.220]   on United, which I'll get to million miler and lifetime status next, you actually can
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.300]   nominate a person that just gets your status.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.300]   That's amazing.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.780]   So for, for three years, my dad had million miler and United and global services.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:11.060]   And I constantly begged him to make me his companion instead of my mom, which he didn't
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.740]   do, which is probably the best choice for him.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.780]   But I was like, come on, make me your companion.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.500]   And so now, uh, funny enough, he still has million miler status.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.400]   He has a lifetime status, so he's got one K for life.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.500]   So my mom also has one K for life.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.500]   That's awesome.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.360]   Which is really, really amazing, which I guess is a good, a good dovetail.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.600]   So there's a lot of different airlines that will gift you status, Delta, Alaska, American,
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.420]   Hilton, Hyatt at different tiers.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.940]   But that lifetime status is another one where once you've played the game enough, you can
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.620]   stop playing the game.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.220]   Um, and, and my wife and I are so close to that with, with Delta.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:53.380]   I mean, well, we both have, um, Delta diamond status, which is the top tier before you get
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.860]   to those like secret tiers.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:04.600]   Um, and, but we're both probably within about five years of getting, um, 2 million miler
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:11.320]   status, which will give us a platinum status for life, which in my mind, that's good enough.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.840]   I would miss some things about diamond, but once, once you have platinum automatically,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.940]   the extra work involved in getting beyond that is so much is so much because the bonuses
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.000]   from credit cards, you don't get to just earn the Delta.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.780]   You have to start all the way from the bottom.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.780]   Exactly.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   Exactly.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.780]   So we'll just stop there.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.420]   And with the major airlines, uh, it's about a million points.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:38.220]   Lifetime points gets you to the kind of like second tier status, like gold level.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.340]   Um, and then depending on the airline Delta, you can get to three 60 with 5 million.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.780]   You can get to global services with 4 million on United, but wow, that is a lot of miles.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.380]   I don't even know how to comprehend flying 5 million miles.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.660]   There are people that do it.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.660]   I'm never going to get there.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:59.260]   I think I, I'm closest on Marriott, which is 10 years at platinum and 600 nights.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.060]   We'll get you platinum for life.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.400]   And I feel like that is in striking distance.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.780]   Everything else is off the table.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.980]   I actually have that with Marriott.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:15.820]   And, um, the, the reason I have it though, um, is, you know, I've had, I've had status
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:21.980]   mostly from credit cards for many years now and the credit cards, the Marriott credit
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.780]   cards give you, um, nights each year.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.500]   So most of the Marriott credit cards give you 15 nights.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.180]   And while having multiple consumer Marriott cards doesn't stack, like you won't get more
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.900]   than 15 nights by having two consumer Marriott cards.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:42.080]   If you have a consumer and a business card, those two stack to 30 nights.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:47.140]   And now if, if the consumer card you have is the brilliant card, then you have 10 more
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.140]   nights.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.500]   So you have 40 nights each year automatically.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.340]   So, so let's say you, you stay, you know, 10 nights a year at Marriott anyway.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.680]   Um, so that's 50 nights every year.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.260]   That's counting towards that, uh, like 600.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   That's counting towards the 600.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.220]   So 10 years of playing the Marriott game and you're going to be pretty close to platinum
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.220]   for life.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.420]   Um, yeah, that's the way I see it is I need like three more years of platinum.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:15.300]   And so it might be worth it even to just pay, to have the brilliant card, to just make sure
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:21.740]   I get there because it's a three year cost of a, you know, five or $600 annual fee minus
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.120]   all the credits and coupons and all that.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.220]   But then you don't have to play again and then you have it for life.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   So the game of kind of hitting lifetime is super interesting on the flights.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.620]   I don't think I'll ever get there.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.500]   Um, a couple of quick ones.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.020]   One is there are a couple of cases where you can buy status.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.540]   So I think frontier allowed you to buy status, uh, and it was very open.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.540]   It wasn't a secret.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.540]   It's like, you could just buy it.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.540]   Yep.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.740]   You don't have to fly on frontier a lot, but if you do, you could do it.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.540]   If you do, it's actually a great deal, uh, you know, cause there's things like a wave
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.920]   pet fees, which if you travel with your pet, it would add up like crazy.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.380]   And you get like free changes, all kinds of things that, um, that can make it very much
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.380]   worth it.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.440]   Americans sold status in the past, but not right now.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.580]   There's a site that I think is pretty sketchy called airline status.com that will claims
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.820]   to sell you status for hundreds of dollars a quarter or a year.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.580]   I will absolutely not endorse it, but they claim to do it.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.780]   If anyone has experience there, I would love to hear how that went.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.140]   Um, and then also this isn't really buying it, but there are corporate partnerships.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:27.480]   So if you work at a large company and they have a program with Delta to save money on
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.740]   long haul flights, chances are there are a few people at that company that are getting
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.740]   comp status.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:33.740]   That's right.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.140]   And so my wife, when she worked at Lyft, she did the partnership with Delta.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.860]   And there were a few people on the executive team at Lyft that got comp status.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.940]   And so I don't know if you can make friends with whoever's doing that deal.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.300]   Maybe you can get on that short list or just be an entrepreneur and become a huge company
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.220]   and partner with Delta or United, whoever you want to fly.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.580]   And then on the corporate side, if you do run a company, maybe it's not big enough to
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:02.020]   do a partnership like that, but it is probably big enough to join one of the corporate programs.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.120]   So United has perks plus and United for business.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.440]   There's one with each, I think Sky bonus is Delta and I can't remember Americans, but
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.840]   they totally revamped it.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.640]   But there are ways to earn extra points for regular flights for everyone on your team.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.060]   So in United, you put all of your employees in, you earn a much smaller number of points,
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:26.800]   but those points can be used to generate free flight certificates or status.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:33.380]   So it ends up costing somewhere on the order of like 80,000 United miles to get United
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.380]   silver and 160,000 United miles to get United gold in their corporate program.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.940]   And then last there's this pass plus program, which basically United lets you pre-buy at
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:49.060]   the beginning of the year, dollars to use on United at a discount and not a discount
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:55.140]   like a percent off, but depending on the fare, you get a baked in corporate rate.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.420]   And if you spend enough, they will comp you status.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.980]   So it starts at $25,000, we'll start comping you gold all the way up to this year, global
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   services.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.540]   If you pre-buy $75,000, you'll get global services for a year.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.900]   The downside is the funds, as long as you keep renewing the program, which I want to
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:19.600]   say is at least $10,000 a year, you won't lose the dollars.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.500]   But to get the status, you have to commit to $75,000 of spend every single year.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.420]   So if you already spend $75,000 a year on United, you'll probably get global services
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420]   anyways.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   I was going to say.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.420]   But here's a way to get it up front.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.740]   And then there are a couple other things that I'll fall in the bucket of corporate partnerships.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:39.740]   If you get a founder's card membership, you're going to get some free hotel status, IHG and
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.740]   Hilton Gold and Caesars Diamond.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.580]   It depends on the type of founder's card membership you get.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.580]   I know, there's tiers now.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.580]   There's tiers.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:53.500]   And if you get the kind from having JetBlue status, then the tier of founder's card you
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.460]   get is the tier that is basically you get on their spam mail.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:04.280]   You get constantly, constantly spammed to pay up to the higher tier.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:09.020]   And that's really the only benefit that I could find out of it, as if that was a benefit.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.540]   And then on the vacation home side, I did a whole episode on vacation homes.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.420]   We're not going to go down that, but I noticed that there's a vacation home thing where you
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.420]   buy into a membership, like a luxury vacation property called Exclusive Resorts.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.580]   And I think every Exclusive Resorts membership also comes with a Delta Platinum status, but
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.860]   you usually have to commit to spending somewhere on the order of $40,000 or $50,000 a year
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.340]   on vacation homes.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.220]   But if you do that, there's a potential option.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.220]   Timeshare ownership.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.340]   Is that similar to what you're talking about?
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:42.300]   Because those also have elite benefits in some cases.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.300]   Yes.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   Often with the hotel.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   This is the only one that I know.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.260]   This one went to the airline, which is kind of cool.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.260]   Yeah, that's different.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.260]   Getting free.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.260]   You're not the kind of person spending $50,000 on vacation homes.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.780]   You're probably also the kind of person that could get a Centurion card and get Delta Platinum
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780]   free also.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.780]   True.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.580]   I think that's all the shortcuts that I found.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.940]   And I went through most of what you've written.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:07.500]   The one question that'll wrap us up is, is this actually worth it?
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.540]   We talked about all the ways to get it, but when does it actually make sense to get elite
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   status?
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.860]   And are there actually ways you can get some of these perks without having to chase the
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.860]   status?
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.220]   So, first of all, is it worth it?
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   Loaded question.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:29.860]   Well, so at a high level, you could sort of argue no, because if you need to do tricks
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:35.340]   to get the elite status, then it means you're not flying that airline a lot or staying in
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:40.700]   those hotels enough to get the status without doing tricks to get there.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:46.780]   And if you're not staying that much or flying that much, how much value could you be getting
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.100]   from these things?
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:53.780]   On the other hand, if you do the tricks to get status and it doesn't cost you that much,
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.700]   so take for example, getting Marriott Platinum status, which you could get just by having
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:05.580]   the Bonvoy Brilliant card, the $650 annual fee is offset by great perks anyway.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:12.620]   So you could think of it as being worth paying anyway, but you get Platinum status and you
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:19.320]   might just have, maybe you've got two big Marriott stays that year, but maybe they're
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.820]   stays that are important to you.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:28.020]   Like maybe you're staying at the, you know, St. Regis Bora Bora and breakfast there would
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:33.620]   cost you something like $50 per person per day, but you're going to get it free because
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.860]   you have that status.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:40.300]   And so the benefits can really add up even just with a couple of stays a year.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.940]   I mean, it's funny because when you say that, I think, well, I did stay at the St. Regis
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.980]   and Bora Bora and I did get free breakfast and that was awesome.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:53.020]   However, I find myself now that I have some status, when I look where we're going, it's
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.700]   almost like I put these blinders on that say, well, let's just look at places where I can
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.700]   get these perks.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:02.780]   And I often wonder, and I'm starting to push myself to not think this way.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.500]   If I didn't worry about trying to stay at the place that I had the status, could I just
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.620]   book a rate that included the free breakfast?
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.380]   And could that even be cheaper or a better experience?
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.680]   And I've broken out of the shell on airlines there because UnitedSilver just isn't really
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.880]   worth anything.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.740]   And so now I just booked the direct flight.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   That's the easiest.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.000]   And if you start playing the points and miles game enough, like you said, you're flying
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.620]   in business or even premium economy, the status kind of doesn't matter.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:33.180]   And so I do question whether sometimes having status forces you to spend more to stay in
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.180]   a thing.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.180]   That's why they do it.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.620]   I mean, that's exactly it.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.620]   People do.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.540]   And yeah, so I think you're exactly right.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:48.180]   I think that analysis is right that in most cases, you're probably better off, you know,
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:53.020]   buying your own elite status by, as you said, you know, booking a stay that already includes
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.180]   the free breakfast, if that's what's important to you.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.500]   Maybe even negotiating rates with a hotel that regardless of whether you have status
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.300]   or not.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:12.460]   So the flip side is, you know, a lot of if you're really into this game, points and miles
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:17.080]   and everything to me, like I just love the game.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.980]   And so it's a game where, you know, you win not just by earning lots of points and having
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:23.980]   the most points.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:29.300]   You win by taking advantage of it and, you know, booking the best stays, booking the
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:33.380]   best flights and travel, you know, traveling the world and enjoying it.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.780]   So the winning is amazing.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.220]   And to me, the elite status thing is almost like part of that game.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.180]   It's like badges you earn along the way.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:48.020]   And then when you enjoy it, when you get like an amazing suite at a hotel, when you get
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:53.980]   regularly bumped up into first class when you're flying, you know, regionally, those
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:53:00.140]   things, it's hard to, you know, sort of put a dollar value on that.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:08.060]   And so if you have the means where you can do these games to get elite status, you know,
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.540]   it's not hurting you financially to do it.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.580]   You might find it's worth doing just because it's fun.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.580]   That's kind of where I am.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.740]   I've enjoyed the game over the years.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.820]   I think when you have kids that are really young, you're like, well, is this game worth
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.820]   it?
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.820]   This this couple of years.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.380]   I feel like I'm kind of getting ready to go back into it.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:27.500]   One thing we didn't really talk too much about, we just touched on a couple of things is when
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.780]   it comes to getting these perks without the status, I'm actually going to point people
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:34.220]   to two episodes you did on rolling your own hotel status and rolling your own airline
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   status.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.220]   Great.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.220]   A couple highlights.
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.220]   You want free check bags?
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.300]   Yes, you can get status or you can just open up a credit card with almost any of the airlines
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.820]   and you get free check bags.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.300]   You want upgrades at hotels.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   You want early check in and late checkout.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.980]   There are a lot of upgrade programs.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:54.340]   We built one for ourselves at allthehacks.com/upgrade where you can book a rate that gives you through
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.420]   Hyatt Preve, Marriott Stars and Luminous, Four Seasons Preferred Partners, a lot of
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.420]   the perks you would get with status anyways.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:07.060]   And sometimes I caught a clip in one episode you did with maybe even a higher upgrade priority.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.460]   So those are the perks you get there.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.740]   And then I know you've talked a lot about you can just use your points and book suites.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.700]   You can use your points and book business class and just kind of do it that way.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.460]   So I'll point people to those two episodes in the interest of time.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:22.940]   But there are also a lot of ways that you could just generate a lot of these benefits
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.580]   without necessarily having to go and earn the status.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.220]   One of the funny things when we were talking about Hyatt a lot, Hyatt is the hardest of
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:35.120]   the hotel chains to get top tier status, but they have the best top tier status.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:41.820]   But they also have the most ways that you can get the benefits of similar to status
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.460]   without getting status.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:49.580]   So they're the best at allowing you to book, you know, suites with points.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.620]   They have the thing like we talked about before of guest of honor.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:55.380]   So if you have a friend who has status, you can get maybe they'll give you a guest of
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   honor certificate.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.820]   Or pay cash and upgrade with points to a suite.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.820]   Exactly.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.180]   There's so many ways with Hyatt to do that.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:07.980]   So it is ironic that it's the best top tier status, but also has the best ways of avoiding
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.300]   needing that status.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.620]   OK, so last two quick things.
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.300]   One, we didn't talk about car rental status at all.
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:18.880]   I'll highlight that the reason why is that you can get car rental status pretty easily.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.760]   If you have a Chase Reserve or Amex Platinum, you're getting top tier or right below top
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.840]   tier status on most programs.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.920]   So we kind of skipped that over.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.580]   Could you in one minute explain whether car rental status even matters or why?
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:37.300]   Yeah, I like I like national executive status because so, you know, national has that emerald
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.140]   aisle where you just pick your own car.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:43.300]   But with executive status, you go to the executive aisle and you could pick from bigger cars.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:50.740]   And what I've done with that is not just get nicer cars in the executive aisle, but also
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:54.500]   there have been times where we're traveling with enough people where we would need two
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.620]   cars or we would need something like a minivan or one of those six seater SUVs.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:05.620]   And often we so we'll book two.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:09.780]   We'll see if we find one of those big minivan or whatever in the executive aisle, because
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.580]   that's where it would normally be.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.200]   And if we if it is, then we cancel the other booking.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.780]   And for anyone who made it this far, that's a hack I've never heard.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.940]   And I love it.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.420]   Last thing before we wrap, we've talked a lot about the show.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.700]   You've been on it before.
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.220]   Everybody should go check out the Frequent Miler site.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.400]   All the episodes you do on Frequent Miler in the air.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.180]   But could you tell people really briefly why we even managed to meet up and what you're
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.180]   in the middle of doing?
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.180]   Sure.
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.660]   So our team does a challenge, some kind of travel challenge where we try to show off
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.180]   like what's the most you could do with points and miles.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:45.420]   So the first ever challenge was called 40K to Far Away, where we each had 40000 points
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:50.220]   and 400 dollars to try to go as far away as we could.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.200]   And each year we make up a different challenge.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.620]   This year it's called Flying by the Seat of our Points.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:04.000]   And the idea is that every two days ish, we're given a destination that we need to get to.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.280]   Like we don't know ahead of time until until we're doing a live stream on YouTube and we're
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.080]   being told, OK, next stop is here.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.460]   And so we're just starting the challenge.
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:21.300]   The first stop for all of us to get to is Los Angeles.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:26.420]   And so today I need to get there by about three.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:31.660]   And our check in at the hotel, we have to be there before six p.m. for our live stream
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:37.340]   check in and over live stream, we'll learn where we're going next, which will be international
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340]   destinations.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:42.020]   And so we're all going to meet up in L.A., but the three of us competing, then we'll
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.140]   go off to different international destinations and then the final stage will come back together
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.580]   somewhere internationally.
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.740]   We don't know where we're going to show off like how you could use points and miles to
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.900]   book last minute travel.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.900]   This is awesome.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.340]   By the time this comes out, this will probably have ended.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:59.460]   I wish you the best of luck on your travels.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:00.460]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.460]   It was great being here.
