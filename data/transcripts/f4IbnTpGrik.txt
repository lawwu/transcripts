[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Pastor John, we talk a lot about multiculturalism in the church, and the question for today is this.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   What does the church offer the world in race reconciliation realistically?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Is the church primarily a place to model racial harmony for the world, or does the church bear responsibility
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   to address police brutality and spearhead broader social changes?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   What would you say to listeners and to leaders who are trying to figure this out?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Well, let me start with a provocative statement, maybe, which would go like this.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   The church is not responsible for the condition of the world.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   The church is responsible for the condition of the church.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And let me supplement that statement with a second one, which I hope refines it.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The church is responsible to address the condition of the world and point the world to Jesus Christ as a great Savior
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   from the wrath of God and the guilt of sin, a Savior who gives the power to be just and loving as a person in the world.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And if you put those two statements together, there are really big implications that follow, I think.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And one is that if the church successfully takes responsibility for the church,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   one of the ways that the church will address the condition of the world is by the alternative community that it is or is becoming.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   In other words, whatever transformation happens in the world is not a primary focus of the church,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   but a reflex of her focus on being a new kind of people in the world.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   These are, of course, the words of Jesus.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   "Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   In the same way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Now, whether the world is finally transformed by such a light, such a city on a hill, is not our responsibility.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   We are primarily a witness to the truth, not an imposer of the truth.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So, let me go back to theâ€”at least, in what you said, I heard three specific questions.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So, on the basis of those general thoughts, let me give a brief answer to each one.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   What, realistically, does the church offer the world in race reconciliation?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Answer, a witness to the reconciling power of the gospel in our message, in our individual relationships, and in our visible community.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Christ died, Paul said, Ephesians 2, that he might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That is, killing ethnic hostility between Jew and Gentile, and by implication, all ethnic hostilities that would rend the body of Christ.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   We're not responsible to make that happen among unbelievers.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   We are responsible to make it happen among believers.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And if we succeed, it will be a powerful witness to the world.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Second question that I heard, is the church primarily a place to model racial harmony for the world?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Answer, no. Not primarily, but significantly.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   To say "primarily" would be to elevate one specific fruit of salvation above all the others, which the Bible doesn't do.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   What about love between men and women?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   What about love between old and young?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   What about love between poor and rich?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   What about love between educated and uneducated?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   What about the acts of love to reach lost people and unengaged peoples?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   What about sacrifices of love that aim to heal diseases or provide education or protect the helpless?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   No, we should not elevate racial harmony above all other acts of love.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It is essential. It is not supreme.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Third, and I think this is the last one in the way the question was posed.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Does the church bear responsibility to address police brutality and spearhead broader social changes?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Given what I've said, my answer is yes, responsible to address.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   No, not responsible to spearhead.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Unless you call addressing spearheading, which it may well be.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The Old Testament prophets were relentless in calling attention to the collapsing conditions in Israel and the nations.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But it was not their responsibility.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It is not our responsibility, the responsibility of the church, to take up the task of training the police.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   That's the job of the state.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And my conviction, in conclusion, is that the church will have its greatest influence for the glory of Christ,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   both individually and socially and eternally,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   if it stays riveted on giving biblical shape to the people of God by his Spirit, through his Word, as a witness to the world.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And as I mentioned earlier, we have a number of episodes on race in this podcast series.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And now there's a new way to search and navigate the archive of over 500 episodes that we have recorded and released to date.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We have apps for the Apple and Android devices, of course.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And now we have a landing page on our website.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Go to DesiringGod.org and at the top of the page, click on the tab that says "More" and then click on "Ask Pastor John."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And there you can search the entire database of episodes by title.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So go to the home page, click on "More" and click on "Ask Pastor John."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Speaking of race, we have an email from a cop who wants to know, "What can a white Christian police officer do to make a difference in the race issues of our country?"
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That's tomorrow.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   [end]
