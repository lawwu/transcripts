[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the seventh chapter, reading from verse 30 to verse 33.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Now this, as most of you will recall, is a part of the speech, the address, which was delivered by a man whose name was Stephen, who was the first Christian martyr.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Stephen was on trial before the great court in Jerusalem, which was known as the Sanhedrin, because of his Christian faith, because of his declaration of that faith, because of his living of that faith.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And they have arrested him and are charging him with blasphemy, because he was preaching and believed that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and that the Son of God had come on earth in order to save men, and that he had done so by dying for their sins upon the cross, and had given proof of all this by rising again from the dead, literally in the body.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   That was what Stephen believed and preached, as the apostles believed and preached.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And it was because of this, and in addition the mighty event on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit had descended upon these people, transforming them, filling them with amazing power, and enabling them to work miracles, it was for these reasons that Stephen was arrested and put on trial.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And here he is now asked to give his defense. The high priest said to him, "Are these things so?" And Stephen replies, and what he does, as we've been seeing, is to give a kind of a bird's-eye view of the history of these Jews, the children of Israel.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   He was a Jew himself, and they were Jews, and what he does is to show them that they've completely misunderstood their own history.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   They're very proud of it, but they've misunderstood it. They're denying it at its most vital points, and he does this by taking up certain great outstanding leaders in the history of the nation, namely Abraham first, and then Joseph, and then thirdly, the case of this man, Moses.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   One of the greatest of all the leaders, the man who led them from the captivity and bondage of Egypt into the promised land of Canaan, the man who was given the great privilege of being the lawgiver, it was to him that God gave the law.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Well, he's obviously a crucial figure in all this history, and what Stephen, you see, is rarely doing is this. He's showing these leading Jews, these masters, chief priests, pharisees and so on, the political leaders also.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They were all there. They were all members of this great court. It was the establishment, as we call it now, in those days amongst the Jews.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He's just showing that in their rejection of Jesus of Nazareth, the son of God, and his great salvation, they're but repeating the same old error of which, as a people, they have been so guilty throughout the running centuries.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's what he's doing. He's bringing it home to them, showing them how they're doing the very selfsame thing that these Israelites did so long ago, even with this great man, Moses.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But, of course, in doing that, he at one and the same time is showing them the nature of God's great salvation, and that's the thing about which we are particularly concerned at the moment.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's the thing that comes out in these verses. We've seen, we've been following Sunday by Sunday, the history of this man Moses, how he'd been brought up as the son of Pharaoh's daughter and had wonderful prospects in that respect.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But after 40 years of that, he felt this call of God, and he gave obedience to it. He gave it all up and identified himself with these miserable people who had become slaves.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   But they rejected him, they misunderstood him, and he had to flee for his life. And we see that for 40 years, this great man, with such unusual ability, we are told, that he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and deeds.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   This great man spends 40 years as a common shepherd. Then comes this amazing statement, "When 40 years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in the flame of fire in a bush."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And the record which follows, which I've just read to you. Now here, you see, is one of these great and glorious statements of the whole character of the Christian gospel, the Christian message.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's a message of salvation. It's a message of deliverance. And here it is put in this graphic form. This is a prefiguring of what God has done yet more perfectly and completely in his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   But what we are confronted by is this, that the world, instead of rejoicing this, rejects this. And alas, that so often the Christian church rejects some of the most glorious aspects of it, and that is what we are now considering together.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We began considering this very statement last Sunday night, and we did so in terms of certain teachings that are very popular at the present time, alas, in the Christian church. In America, there's that movement called the "Death of God" movement.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And I gave you some quotations from the famous Dr. Fosdick, who, while rejecting that teaching, goes on to so modify the Christian message as to make it almost unrecognizable.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And what is so tragic, as we saw, is this, that the things they deny and object to, and the world is the same outside. I'm not surprised that the world does this. You can't expect the world to do anything else.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   What they deny is what, after all, is the most glorious aspect of this. You see, they say that God's inside you. Well, there'd be no salvation if that were true. Salvation is possible because God is outside us.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   He's the God, the living God. He's personal. He's not a mere sentiment, not a mere general feeling of love and of goodness. No, no, God is. I am what I am. And he's outside us. And he acts, he intervenes, he suddenly appears, as we see here, and thank God.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He appears to us when we least expect it, in the wilderness. After forty years of frustration and disappointment and hopelessness and near despair, he comes into the wilderness of Asina, and he speaks his great and his glorious word.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Well, no, that is what we've seen so far, but we must go on with this, because that's only the beginning. The moment we say that, we are bound to consider this second question which is to engage us tonight, which is, what is our response to this? What is our reaction to this?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Now, here is a most important question. We're dealing here, in a very practical way, with the reason why most people in this country are not Christian tonight, and why so much that passes as Christianity is nothing but a denial of Christianity, and that is why the masses are outside.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   They are confused, because of the confusion amongst those who call themselves Christians, who, as I say, deny it at its most glorious points. Why do they do this? Well, the answer is that their whole approach to it is wrong, and it follows, doesn't it, of necessity, that if your approach to any subject is wrong, you'll never be able to grasp it, you'll never be able to understand it, you'll never be able to be helped by it.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   If your approach is wrong, your initial approach, there is no hope whatsoever. If you come with prejudice, well, you can't understand. The prejudiced man is not open to enlightenment. He puts himself into a position where nothing can happen to him. That's why the members of the Sanhedrin were putting Stephen on trial. That's why these same people have crucified the Son of God. They couldn't see it. Why?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, their whole attitude, their whole approach is wrong. Nothing is more important than this. And this, of course, is the essence of the modern tragedy and the essence of the modern difficulty with regard to this whole matter of the Christian faith and of its great salvation.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Oh, my dear friends, are we aware of this tragedy? We see the world as it is, in its trouble and in its pain and in its agony. But what makes the tragedy is this, that here is a message that offers to deliver us. It's a message of salvation, deliverance, emancipation, health, liberty.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   This is the thing that the world, in its blindness, is rejecting. And it does so, I say, because its whole approach to it is so grievously and entirely wrong.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Now, what do I mean by this approach? Well, again, in a very interesting way, these things keep on being repeated and they are put before us. And so I'm able to put it to you again in one of the typical modern expressions of this whole fallacy which I'm putting to your consideration.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Now, a book has been recently published, and this is its title, "The God I Want." Now, you see the title, "The God I Want." And one of the writers, who's an ordained member of a certain church and a teacher of theology in the University of Cambridge, he puts it like this.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   "The God he wants," he says, "is a God who is not mixed up with the infantile fantasies of omnipotence." Did you get that? "The God he wants is a God who is not mixed up with the infantile fantasies of omnipotence."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   The idea of an omnipotent God to this man is infantile, just a childish fantasy, the sort of thing that a child does think of, some infinite bogeyman, some great omnipotent person.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Now, he says, "The God I want is a God who is not mixed up with this sort of infantile fantasy of omnipotence." Now, there is a very perfect statement of this modern attitude that I'm trying to describe to you.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It's in line with what I quoted to you last Sunday night from those other movements. This, indeed, is a part of the same movement. Now, well, let me put it like this to you succinctly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   There's no need for anybody to read that book. The title tells you all about it. This is true of many books, isn't it? You can tell, more or less, the contents of the book by looking at the title.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And here is the title of this book, "The God I Want." You see where the emphasis is on "I." I am the important one, the God I want. I'm not ready to take any sort of God.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I want a certain type of God, the God I want. And so, you get these blasphemous statements as to what you don't want.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Well, now, let us, therefore, look at this great statement that we've got here in the light of this modern approach to this whole question of God and of religion and of the Christian faith and its great message of salvation.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It is, as I'm going to show you, because men and women approach it in that way, instead of the way that is taught here, that they reject it.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   This is the tragedy of tragedies. Now, here we are told, you see, the true way, and it's the exact opposite of that.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   When forty years were expired, there appeared unto Moses in the wilderness of Mount Simon an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   When Moses saw it, he wandered at the sight, and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   "I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abram, and of Isaac, and of Jacob."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Then Moses trembled and durst not behold. Then said the Lord to him, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place where thou standest is holy ground."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Now, this is Stephen's recapitulation or reminder to these people of the account which is put in the third chapter of the book of Exodus, where you've got these additional details.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   When Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb, and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses! Moses!"
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Moreover, he said, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And Moses hid his face and was afraid to look upon God.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Now there it is in greater fullness and in greater detail, but Stephen, as you see, gives us the essence of the story.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Well now, what is the lesson? What does it tell us?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Here, my friends, is the Christian message. Here is the biblical message. Thank God it is.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   What are its characteristics? Well, you notice the first thing that is true of it is this, that it is a matter of revelation.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   After thirty years, forty years were expired, there appeared unto him, this is a matter of revelation.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It is not of men at all. Moses, as I say, was reduced to the position and the condition of a shepherd.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He wasn't in the wilderness trying to work out a philosophy of life and searching for God.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   No, no, he was doing his job, feeling pretty hopeless.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   As I was able to show you last week, suddenly there appeared.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Now this is not of men at all. This is entirely of God. It's all given.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And this is the first thing we've got to learn about this great message.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It is not the result of human thought. It's not the result of human ability.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   It's not the result of human investigation. It is not the result of human inquiry.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   You see, we are all so taken up with this idea of the quest and the search and the research.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And we are so accustomed to reading about discoveries and inventions as the result of discoveries and so on,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   that we tend to think that everything comes to us as the result of our own effort and striving and seeking and research work and endeavour.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And that all we have is the result of our quest and our search.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Well, we're all accustomed to that. It's become second nature to us.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And it is because of that that we, when we hear this message, we instinctively react against it and we tend to reject it.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Because this, you see, is the absolute antithesis of everything we've ever known.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   This is something that comes to us, comes to us as a great surprise.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   It comes altogether to us from God.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Now, I want to emphasise this. There is no mixture even of human wisdom and reason and understanding yet, none at all.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It is all of God. Moses made no contribution to this crucial event in his life and in his story.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   He made no contribution. It all came.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   This didn't happen to Moses as the result of a long period of preparation, nothing at all.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Taken completely by surprise.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Just when we are safest, there's a sunset patch, someone's death, a chorus ending from Euripides.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   You remember how Browning puts it in Bishop Blogram's Apology.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   That's it. Suddenly, just when we are safest, when we least expect it.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And we've made no contribution whatsoever to it.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   You know, this Gospel is altogether from the outside. It's altogether from God.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It's not a supplement to our thinking. Many have misunderstood it in that respect.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They say men go so far, well then he comes to a dead end, then God supplements it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   That's not what we are told here. We are told that men's thinking is all wrong.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   That's why the Lord Jesus Christ said to that learned teacher, Nicodemus, you must be born again.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Christianity is not a supplement to human philosophy. It's altogether different.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It doesn't base anything upon human philosophy, human thinking, human endeavour, human anything.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Nothing at all. It is entirely of God. It's revelation. It's given.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Now this is a very vital point, of course.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I know, as I say this, that I'm saying something that is particularly obnoxious and objectionable to the modern men.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I'm sorry, I can't help that. I was born a natural man myself and I know the reaction.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I'm not here to please men. I'm here to preach the word of God because I know that's the only thing that can do men any good.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I could please you. I can please men. I think I might have made a politician if I wanted to.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   But my dear friends, I'm not here to please men.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I'm here to preach this gospel, to expound the word of God that is here open before me.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And no consideration of pleasing comes in. It's what's good for the souls of men that matters, nothing else.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And here it is. And I therefore have to emphasise that it is revelation, which means not only that it comes altogether from God,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   but that it is a complete system, a complete system which has got to be taken as it is and in its entirety.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   God didn't call Moses into a consultation and say, "Now Moses, what do you think about this problem of rescuing your fellow countrymen who are in the bondage of Egypt?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   What are your ideas?" And Moses said, "Well, I've been thinking a lot about this and this is my idea. I'd like a little help if you don't mind."
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   You see, that's the exact opposite of what took place. And that is the simple truth still about this gospel.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   In the Bible, you have a complete scheme of salvation, entire. It's a whole, and it's all from God.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   It's God's plan, it's God's purpose, and he's worked it out in detail. It is, as I'm going to show you, God-willing.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Something that God has worked out from the beginning to the very end, and it's presented to us as a whole, and we've got to receive it as a whole.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   You don't be confused with this. It's one great, complete, entire message to which we make no contribution whatsoever.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   There it is. Revelation. Moses doing his work, taking these sheep round the back side of the mountain and looking at them and wondering how they were going to get on there because it was a wilderness.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Suddenly, there it is, and he's confronted by it, and the whole course of his history and the whole course of human history is changed because of what God did and what God said.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And it's all of God. Well, that's the first thing we find.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   The second thing we find is this, that the outstanding characteristic of this action of God is that it is supernatural.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Now, I'm really saying it, am I not? Supernatural.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   What, says somebody, are you standing in a pulpit in 1967 and talking about the supernatural?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   My dear friend, I wouldn't be in the pulpit but for the supernatural. I'd be in a political or a social meeting.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's because it's supernatural I'm here. That's what makes it what it is. That's why it's the only hope for the world tonight.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   The condition of mankind is such that nothing less than the supernatural is going to make the slightest difference to it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Everything else has failed. Supernatural.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But let me be yet more vile and let me show you what you are asked to believe as you listen to this gospel.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   In other words, if you want to go out of this building a new man or a new woman, this is it. This is the supernatural message.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   An angel appeared. Angels. Do you believe in angels?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Is it possible for the modern sophisticated scientific men to believe in angels?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   This is something that's left at one of the fantasies that the learned people talk about.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Children, of course, believe in angels. Primitive men believe in angels, but not the men of the 20th century.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   But now wait a minute. Why not? Why not?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   What does the 20th century know that makes any difference to angels?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Why shouldn't you believe in angels? The Bible is full of angels.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Angels appearing. Angels bringing messages. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews says that the angels are the ministering servants of God.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And that he uses them to speak to people, to bring messages, even as he did here in the case of Moses.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   No, no, this is a frankly supernatural message.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It tells us, you see, of the everlasting and eternal God existing in three persons, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It tells us that no man has seen God at any time, and that yet God is and has made everything, and that the universe would collapse without him.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   God, Spirit, God is Spirit. No man has seen God at any time.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Here it is, supernatural, and not only the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Myriads of angels, and archangels, seraphim, cherubim, all that unseen realm is peopled by these august beings.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   This is essential to the biblical message, that we are surrounded by an unseen spiritual world,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   and that occasionally these others visit this world in visible form, and do their work.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   You can't begin to understand the message of the Bible unless you believe this.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And then, of course, on top of that is this whole element of miracle.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Miracle. Again, the modern sophisticated man says, you surely don't believe in miracles.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Not now, surely, not now in this scientific age. Miracle, a bush burning on fire and yet not consumed.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   There it is flaming, and yet it goes on flaming. It doesn't suddenly disappear, the flame doesn't go out.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   No, no, it's blazing in fire, and yet it goes on existing. It's a miracle.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And then a voice speaks out to the bush, and addresses Moses.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Now this is an essential part of this message.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And as I say, it's essential in the sense that if this aspect of it isn't true,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   we've got no gospel at all, and there is no hope for anybody.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   This gospel is, frankly, miraculous and supernatural.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   What is this? Well, it is a message of God's mighty acts, and their supernatural acts.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   As Peter put it, and as the people put it indeed on the day of Pentecost,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   these men, they say, are speaking to us in our own tongues, the wonderful works of God.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And they're wonderful, they're amazing.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   We are told here that when Moses saw it, he wandered at the sight.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It is, it's miraculous. It is supernatural.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   And this is the characteristic of all the works of God as they're recorded in the Bible.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   This is the first thing you've got to start with.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   You say, the God I want. This is the God you need.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   The only God who can save you.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   What is, what are we told about him?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Well, I could keep you for hours because this is the whole message you see of the Bible.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Take the Old Testament.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   In the beginning, God created.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   That's a miracle. God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   There was nothing there. God produces it. That's a miracle.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   That's supernatural action. On you go.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   The flood, the destruction. Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   All these are miracles.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Jacob, running away from his brother, puts himself down to sleep that night at a place called Bethel.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   As a vision, God appears. It's miraculous, supernatural.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   He wakes up and he says, "This is the house of God. This is the gateway of heaven.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   God is in this place and I didn't know it."
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And he feared God appearing. Always supernatural.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Same thing exactly as he went back later, years later, in order to meet his brother Esau.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   That event at Peniel.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   This person who came and struggled with him and who lamed him.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   But oh, it was the biggest thing that ever happened to him.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Another had appeared to him and had dealt with him and had done something to him and had made a new man of him.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Jacob becomes Israel. What is it? God?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And on it goes. Here it is in the case of Moses.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And as you go on with this story of Moses bringing the children of Israel out of the captivity of Egypt.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   What are you confronted by?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   You're confronted by a whole series of miracles.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Ten of them happened before they even left Egypt.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Then they come out of Egypt in a marvelous manner.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And they go on and suddenly there's a dead stop. Red Sea.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Mountain here, mountain there. Hosts of Pharaoh behind.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   An impossibility. The sea divides.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Now this is history.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   This is salvation history.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   This is God's facts of history.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   If this isn't true, I have no message for you.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   This is the God of salvation.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   The Red Sea divides. It's a miracle.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Then the giving of the law on the mountain quaking on fire.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Then the crossing of Jordan in a miraculous manner.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   The destruction of Jericho in a miraculous manner.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   The miracles of Elijah. The miracles of Elisha.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   At all the crucial moments in the history of these people.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Miraculous interventions. Supernatural interferences.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   This is the essence of the story.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   You can't understand the history of the Jews.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Except in terms of this miraculous supernatural and divine action.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And of course when you come to the New Testament.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   The thing is still more plain and obvious.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Go back and read the introductions.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   To the gospels according to Matthew and Luke.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And you know what you'll find? You'll find angels.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   A man called Zacharias went in to do his turn of duty one day.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   As he'd been doing it for so many years.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   He was an old man now at the point of retirement.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Suddenly an angel appears to him.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   The angel of the gospel is introduced into the gospel of Luke.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   An angel appears and speaks to this man and he's struck dumb.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And then he's given his speech back.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   An angel. Same thing.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   You take angels out of the Bible. What have you got left?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   You haven't got the gospel. You've got no real message.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And then you remember.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   In the case of Mary the mother of our Lord.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Suddenly an archangel appears to her.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And speaks to her saying, "Blessed are thou Mary above all women."
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And he gives the message. An angel? An archangel?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   This is the essence. The very essence of this message.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It is altogether supernatural and miraculous.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And likewise the virgin birth of Christ.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Now my dear friends you've got to be clear about these things.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Jesus of Nazareth had no human father.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Mary herself stumbled at this.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   The archangel said to her, "The power of the highest shall overshadow thee."
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Mary says, "How can I of being a virgin bear a son?"
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   She says, "The thing's impossible. I've never known a man."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Those were her exact words.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   The archangel replied, "The power of the highest shall overshadow thee."
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "The holy thing that's to be born of thee is to be conceived of the Holy Ghost."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   "With God nothing shall be impossible."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   The very birth of our Lord was a miracle.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   This is not just a man, you know, thrown out suddenly and unexpectedly by a race.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   No, no. It's God the eternal Son coming into the world out of the eternal glory.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And being born as a babe in a miraculous manner.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   It's a sheer miracle.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   This is the essence of the New Testament message.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   They all preached this.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Made of a woman, made of the law.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Born of the seed of David according to the flesh.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   But declared to be the son of power according to the spirit of holiness.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   By the resurrection from the dead. The virgin birth.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And then you go on. Read his history.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   What you find?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Well, you find that he worked miracles.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   He was only a carpenter.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   He hadn't been trained in the schools of the Pharisees.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   He wouldn't have been a member of the Sanhedrin. He hadn't got the qualifications.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And yet, you see, here he is dominating the whole scene.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Gathering the people after him.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   What was his secret?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Well, he did speak amazing words.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   They were astounded at the gracious words that came over his lips, we are told.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   But you see, the thing that really arrested the people was his miracles.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   This was the thing that shook them.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Do you remember how Nicodemus put it to him?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   We know that thou art a servant come from God.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   A teacher come from God.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   What was it, you think, that made people listen to this carpenter?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   This unknown person?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   This man who was learning never having learned?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   What was it?
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Oh, it was the miracles.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   This was the attestation of his power.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And on one occasion he remonstrated with the Jews and he said,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Even if you don't believe me and my words, believe me for the very work's sake.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Look at the facts.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   The miracles.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   You take the miracles out of the life of Christ, what have you got left?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   John says that they are signs that the word he uses for them.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   This sign did Jesus.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   These are the attestations of his person.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   It's all miraculous and supernatural.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And then I hurry on to the greatest miracle of all, the resurrection.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   He is the first to rise from the dead.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Bursts asunder the bends of death.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Not a resuscitation as in the case of Lazarus or the case of the son of the widow of Nain.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   No, no.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Here is a resurrection.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   The firstborn from amongst the dead.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   The great miracle, the conquest of death.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Here it is.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It's a part of the preaching.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   There would have been no Christian church but for this.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Stephen would not be in trial were it not for the fact that he was asserting this.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   This thing.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And on top of it all, that great fact of the coming of the Holy Spirit and the day of Pentecost.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And then, once these men are filled with this power, they begin to work miracles.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   You remember the story.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   You read these early chapters of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   The apostles had already been thrown into prison more than once before Stephen was ever arrested.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Why were they in trouble?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Well, it was because Peter and John were going up into the temple one afternoon at the hour of prayer to say their prayers.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   They were confronted by a poor fellow sitting on the pavement outside the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   He'd never walked in his life.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   He was over 40 years of age.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Nobody could do anything for him.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And he expected to receive a gift, to receive alms from Peter and John as he'd received from so many others.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   But Peter and John fastened their eyes upon him and said, "Look on us."
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And he looked.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And Peter said, "Silver and gold am I none, but such as I have, give I thee.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And he rose up immediately.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And there he is in a minute walking and leaping and praising God in the temple.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   There would have been no church but for this.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   There would have been no Christianity.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   We wouldn't be here tonight.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   This is the essence of the message.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   An angel appeared, the flaming bush which isn't consumed, miracle supernatural.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And this is equally true of the way of salvation that is offered us.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   What is it?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   What does Christianity offer us?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Is it an exhortation to you to live a better life?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Is the business of preaching for me and others to tell you stop drinking, stop committing adultery,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   don't do this and that, try and pull yourself together, read good books, get a little moral uplift,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   gradually make yourself a better man, a thousand times no because that's no message.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   We can't do it.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   What is it then?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Well, as you saw there our Lord puts it so plainly to Nicodemus, "You must be born again."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   This is the message and it's a miracle.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   We can't be improved.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   We need the miracle of a rebirth, a new generation, a new nature, a new creation.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   The God who created all at the beginning is going to create us anew, make new men of us,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and here is the hope and the only hope.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   It isn't moral reformation, it is regeneration and life in the spirit.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   It offers us a new start, a new beginning.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   It offers us a new power which is the power of God himself unto salvation.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It offers us power to live the remainder of our lives in this world,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and at the end it promises us a like conquest over death, a glorious resurrection,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   and an eternity in the presence of God.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   But it's all a miracle.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   It's not an educational scheme.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   It's not a moral ethical scheme.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   It's not a political scheme.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   It's nothing but the recreating work of the almighty God.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   It is miracle, it is supernatural, it is divine action from beginning to end.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   This is the message of the Christian gospel of salvation.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Well, now then, here is the next vital question, isn't it?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   What is our attitude and reaction to this?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Here is the question.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   The Sanhedrin rejects it.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   They rejected the Son of God and his preaching,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and they're rejecting his apostles.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   They're rejecting his deacons, of whom Stephen was one.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Oh, here's the great question.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   What's our reaction to this?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   What's our attitude to it?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   This is where the world goes so wrong today,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   and, alas, as I say, where the church, to her eternal shame, goes so wrong.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   These men who think that they're going to appeal to the people who are outside
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   by diluting this gospel, by taking out the miraculous,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   taking out the supernatural, taking out the divine,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and reducing it to a mere moral, ethical, social, political system.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   They think they're going to win people.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They're driving them from the churches,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   because they're denying the essence of the gospel.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   The gospel is a miracle.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   It's the action of God.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   With God, nothing shall be impossible.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Don't marvel, says our Lord to Nicodemus.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   This is it. I'm announcing it to you.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Now then, what is this wrong action?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Well, Moses, unfortunately, but he was only human.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   You see, Moses wasn't divine.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Moses was human like us, and Moses at first himself went wrong.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   When Moses saw this phenomenon, he said,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   "I will turn aside, and I will see this great sight."
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Typical modern scientific men, you see, a phenomenon.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Ah, well, investigation. What is this?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   So I bring all my ability to it.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   He has a desire--he's moved by curiosity,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   so he has a desire to investigate.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   He has a desire to understand.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   He wants to explain this thing.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   What is this?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Exactly like Nicodemus.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   When our Lord says to him, "You must be born again,"
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Nicodemus says, "How can a man be born when he's old?"
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   He's trying to understand.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He's using his own critical apparatus.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   How can this happen? How can these things be?
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   So Nicodemus, you see, comes with the typical human confidence
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   as Moses did when confronted by the burning bush,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   filled with a confidence in men's ability and men's understanding,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   men's attitude which says, "The God I want."
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   You investigate God.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You begin to examine God.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   You say, "I don't want this. I don't want that infantile fantasy,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and I don't want the--this is the God I want,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and I'm not accepting any God unless He conforms to my dictates and my demands."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Now, that's typical of the modern attitude.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Man decides. What is this?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Man is the final judge and arbiter in all matters.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Man has the capacity to pronounce judgments, even on God.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Oh, my dear friend, learn the lesson that Moses had to learn.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   He was shown how completely wrong he was.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Here he is. He's about to advance and to investigate.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Suddenly, a voice comes to him out of the bush and says, "Moses! Moses!"
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   And he stands back.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   What's he being told?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Well, he's being told that his whole attitude is wrong.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   He should have seen this.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   We are told that he wandered at the sight.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   It was a marvel.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   To translate that, he marveled at the sight.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Shouldn't that in itself cause us to be humble?
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Whenever you see anything extraordinary,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   you don't rush forward in self-confidence.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   You stand back in amazement and in astonishment.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   That's what Moses should have done,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   confronted by something so extraordinary and unusual.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   He should have held back.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And when you go on to consider further reasons
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   why this should be our attitude, you see it's still more plainly.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   What are we concerned about here?
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Well, we are concerned about the nature of the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   God is. Can you conceive of God?
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Can you measure God?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Can you think of absolute qualities?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Can you think of omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Of course you can't. Our minds boggle.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And yet modern men in his folly comes to investigate God.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   The God I want puts his little tape measure,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   tries to put his little tape measure on God.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   What a fool man he is.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Here he is confronted by the infinite, the absolute, the eternal God.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   And he wants to understand.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   The very word God should show him the utter impossibility.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   If I could measure and understand God, He wouldn't be God.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   He'd be smaller than my mind. There's the first reason.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   But then consider the second, which is men himself.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   The utter inadequacy of men. What do I mean?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Well, I mean that men is finite.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Very finite, very small.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Oh, but you see, look at all we've learned and discovered in this 20th century.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   You think of what you don't know. Think of the appalling ignorance,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   especially in the matter of your knowledge of yourself and how to live and so on.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   All the finite character of men.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   How small he is.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   What's the use of bursting about sending people up into outer space
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   and talking about millions and millions and millions of miles and of years
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   if it doesn't make you see your own finite condition
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   and your smallness and your insignificance.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   How contradictory we are in our proud boastings and vaporings.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   The finite condition of men, but he's not only finite, he's sinful.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   In other words, he can't think straightly.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   We've seen that on previous Sunday evenings,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   there is that about us that vitiates all our best efforts.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   We are biased. We are prejudiced.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   We are not clear. Our minds are not open. They're not free.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   There's no such thing as free thought.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   All our thinking is blinded by prejudices, preconceived notions and ideas.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   We are sinful, biased.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   We are even perverted.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   We are liars. We'll twist and turn.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   We'll do anything to wriggle out of things.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   There is no health in us.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   And yet you see, in spite of that, man like Moses goes on to investigate.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And it's because he's foolish enough to do that,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   he ever goes away rejected and rejecting.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And he goes on in his misery and his failure and his shame.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   That's the wrong way of reacting to God's supernatural intervention.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   What is the true way?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Thank God we are told this here quite clearly.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   But you notice this, don't you?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   We are in such a terrible case and condition as human beings
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   that we even need to be taught how to approach this matter,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   how to listen to it.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   We don't even know that.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Still less can we understand the miraculous and the supernatural and the divine.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Man is so completely hopeless that he needs to be instructed
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   as to how he conducts himself and behaves himself even as he listens.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   You see, we come confident in our knowledge, scientific requirements.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   We are ready. We are now able to measure all things.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   We have put God, as it were, on the table.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   We are ready for the great inspection and the great analysis.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   The God of all we want.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And as you begin your investigation, he shouts at you.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   He calls to you. Commends you.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   "Stop," he says. "Man, do you realize what you are doing?
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Moses, Moses."
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Moses is arrested. He is commended to stand still.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   And you know, this is the great word that I read in the New Testament,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   that three times a voice came from heaven
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   attesting the claims of Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   and the voice from heaven said this,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   "This is my beloved son. Hear him. Listen to him."
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   God commends us.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   And he commends every one of us tonight.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   What does he say to us? He tells us this.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   He says, "Your whole attitude is wrong. Stop. Go back. Stand back.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Who are you to advance and to examine and investigate and analyze?
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Stand back.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   You must be born again. Your whole attitude is completely wrong."
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   And Moses recognizes the voice of authority, the voice of God, and he listens.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   You see, there are two kinds of wondering.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   There is a wondering that is wrong, and there is a wondering that is right.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   The wondering that leads to curiosity and investigation is wrong.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   It's of that our Lord says, "Why marvel ye at this?"
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   But there is a true wondering.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   It's the wondering that Moses now began to feel.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   He hears the voice, and then I read,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   "Moses trembled and durst not behold. He put his hands on his face.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   He dared not look at God."
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Here is the true response.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   There do you realize that you're in the presence of the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Moses trembled.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   He was filled with a feeling of fear and of awe and of reverence.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   He was humble.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground."
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   You're in the presence of God.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Your pride must be broken. Your spirit must be broken.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   You must approach God with reverence and with godly fear. Why?
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Well, because God is who and what He is.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   He's the God of glory.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   He's the God of holiness.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   He's the God of power.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   My friend, don't you realize that you are in the hand of God?
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   The God that you were proposing to investigate is the God who has not only given you life and being,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   your breath is in His hands.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And He can destroy you in a second if He chooses to do so.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   You can do nothing about it.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   You can no longer control God than you can control the lightning and the thunder and the raging of the sea.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   God, who is over all, and He's there, and you are nothing.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Take off thy shoes from off thy feet.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   You are going to judge God.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   You say, "The God I want, I'm not going to believe in a God who has any part or is mixed up in any way with that infantile fancy of omniscience."
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Aren't you?
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   Well, whether you say that or not, you do play a part with Him, and you'll have to play a part with Him.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Your times, your life is in His hands.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Your breath is in His hands.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   And we've all got to die and we've got to stand before Him
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   before you go further with your examination and your investigation
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   and your desiderata and your postulation of what you want in God.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I say, realize what you are, that you're nothing, that you're a dying, vanishing worm.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   And that you'll have to stand in the presence of Almighty God.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   My dear friend, it's not your opinions that matter finally, it's your whole attitude.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   It's the title of your book that condemns you.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   It's your self-righteousness, your self-confidence, your self-assurance in the presence of God.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Stand back, take off your shoes from off your feet.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   You are standing on holy ground.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   And then imitate and emulate the example of Moses.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   He's ready to listen.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   He's afraid to look.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   He feels the presence of God.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   This is what makes a man a Christian.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   No man has ever become a Christian without going through this in some shape or form.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   It isn't always as dramatic as in the case we're dealing with, but no man can be a Christian
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   who doesn't know what it is to tremble in the presence of Almighty God.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   To see his own smallness, his own insignificance, his own vileness, his own utter hopelessness.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   And here he is, what can he do?
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Well, he's just ready to listen.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   He knows he can do nothing.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Here is a message, he's ready to listen to it.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Whether he understands it or not is not the question now.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   It is that he's face to face with God.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   And the moment you become conscious of the presence of God, you do what Moses did.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   You put your hands over your face.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   You dare not look, not because God is cruel, but because he's kind, because he's pure,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   because he's holy, and you feel vile.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Or do you remember what we are told about Job?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Poor old Job, a good and a godly and a righteous man.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   But he was afflicted and he was pride, and he grumbled and complained, and he criticized God.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   And he said many things that he shouldn't have said.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   He was a much better man than those miserable friends of his.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   And then God suddenly appears to him.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   And poor Job says, "I put my hand upon my mouth.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I've spoken unadvisedly with my lips.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   I have heard of thee with the hearing of my ear.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   But now mine eyes see thee."
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   And he puts his hand upon his mouth.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   There's no hope for any of us until we are silenced, until we are utterly ashamed,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   until we become like the publican depicted by our Lord in his parable of the publican
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and the Pharisee that went up into the temple to pray.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   You remember the proud Pharisee goes to the front.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   "I thank thee, O God."
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   He can speak to God as an equal.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   He's such a good man.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   He goes home unblessed.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   He goes home damned, as he richly deserves to be.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Who's the man who's blessed?
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   The poor publican, who's so aware of his sinfulness, his vileness, and his shame
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   that he beats his breast.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   He can't lift up his face even.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   He can just cry out in his agony, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   He isn't investigating.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   He knows that he has been investigated, and that the judgment has been pronounced.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   "Mene, mene, tekele, uphausen."
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Thou hast been judged and weighed in the balance and found wanting.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   He's got nothing, no excuse, no plea.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   He knows nothing, and he's silent.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   This is repentance, acknowledgement of your sin, your shame, your utter unworthiness
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   of anything from God.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And then you just cast yourself as you are and listen to him.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   And the moment you do so, he will do what God, through the angel, did to Moses
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   at the burning bush in the wilderness of Sinai.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   He'll tell you the message of deliverance.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   He'll tell you that he has loved you with an everlasting love,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   that he so loved you that he sent his only begotten Son into the world to die for you,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   that you should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   He'll tell you that he's been seeking you,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   that that's why he's disturbed your life and entered into it.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   That's why he's drawn you to himself.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   He wants you in spite of your arrogant rebellion
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   and all your defiance and self-confidence.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   He wants to make you his child.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   And having forgiven you, he'll make a new man, a new woman of you,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   and he'll put a new heart into you and a new mind,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   new desires, a new understanding, a new power.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   He'll make of you a new being.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   That's the way.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   You stop, you're silent, you listen.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   You hear the glorious message and you yield yourself unreservedly to it
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   and you begin to glory in it.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Glory in the fact that it is of God.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Glory in the fact that it's miraculous and supernatural,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   that you can have a new nature.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   That whatever you were when you came into this service,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   under this power, you can become a new creature.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   You can go home tonight a new person,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   so different from what you were when you came
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   that you'll find it even difficult to recognize yourself.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And everybody who knows you will say, "What's happened to you?
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   You're different. You're a new person."
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   And you'll say, "Of course I am, for I have believed the gospel,
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   which is the power of God unto salvation."
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   The power of God unto salvation.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   To everyone that believeth.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   When the world by wisdom knew not God,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   to save them that believe.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Amen.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
