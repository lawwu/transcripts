[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   when you're ready to go, Dave.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.600]   - Hi, I'm here with Buck.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.140]   Buck, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.780]   - Hello, my name is Buck Wilford.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.980]   I live in Strongsville, Ohio,
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.860]   and I pastor at Brunswick Community Church.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740]   - And Buck, you've been reading through the LSB.
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.140]   You want to tell us a little bit about your experience?
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.540]   - I've read entirely through the LSB last year.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.180]   I do a daily Bible reading plan,
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.740]   and I lead my church, and about 80 people that follow me
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.220]   as I write devotion, but what I read each day,
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.660]   I'm on my second time through that this year already,
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.460]   and I really love the LSB.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.260]   I love the way the word slave is brought out so much,
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.820]   and showing as we're a servant of God,
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.780]   we're a slave of God.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.960]   I love the way the word loving kindness
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.740]   is brought out so much, wherever it should be brought out,
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.260]   because it's one of God's biggest traits
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.060]   and characteristics, and I love the word Yahweh,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.020]   because it brings God so personal.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.140]   Rather than just reading L-O-R-D
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140]   and getting confused with Lord to Lord
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.760]   with capital letters, you have that personal name of God,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.460]   and it draws out so much strength with it there.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.260]   - Thank you so much, Buck, we appreciate it.
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.100]   - Thank you so much.
