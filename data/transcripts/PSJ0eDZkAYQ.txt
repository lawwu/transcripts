[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720]   - Well, we end the week with a good question
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.520]   that moves us into a discussion on what to think
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.440]   of things like fortune tellers and necromancers
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.220]   and palm readers and witches.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.200]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Kristen,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.120]   a listener to the podcast in Norway.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.260]   In 1 Samuel 28, Saul wants to contact Samuel
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.400]   through a medium, and he does,
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.940]   but how can this be possible?
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.800]   You can't contact dead people.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   And all spirits, except the Holy Spirit, is from the devil.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.400]   So why does not chapter 28 forbid it,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   and what are your thoughts in the realities
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200]   at play in this passage?
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   - Here's the short answer to Christine,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.520]   and then I'll say just a bit more.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.520]   1 Samuel 28 has lots to say about consulting
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.880]   with necromancers and mediums who interact with the dead,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.340]   and all of it is negative.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.460]   And the point here, and throughout the Old Testament,
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.460]   is that God's people should not consult with mediums,
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.020]   not because there's no such thing
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440]   as communication with the dead,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.180]   but because it is an abomination
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.220]   to try to communicate with the dead.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.160]   The point is never in the Old Testament
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.960]   that it's impossible, but that it is wicked and sinful,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.820]   and will bring down God's judgment if we do it.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.980]   That's the short answer.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.980]   The situation in 1 Samuel 28 is that Saul and David
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.860]   have been at odds for a long time,
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.320]   and David is rising in God's favor to be the new king,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.400]   and Saul is becoming increasingly disobedient
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.940]   and unacceptable as God's king.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.320]   Back in chapter 15, Saul disobeyed God
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.900]   and failed to destroy the Amalekites.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.880]   Samuel the prophet confronts him
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.020]   and says that God has now rejected him as being king.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.640]   He's torn the kingdom away from him.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.380]   He's gonna give it to David.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.380]   Then Samuel says something very significant
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.340]   in chapter 15, verse 23,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.940]   and it's very relevant to what's gonna happen
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.280]   over in chapter 28.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.340]   Saul had defended his disobedience
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.940]   by saying he intended to sacrifice
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.960]   some of the stolen things to God.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   And Samuel says, "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.500]   for rebellion is as the sin of divination."
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.940]   Necromancy, mediums.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.380]   "And presumption is as the iniquity of idolatry,
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.060]   because you have rejected the word of the Lord.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.700]   He has rejected you from being king."
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   So did you hear the reference to divination?
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.380]   Divination refers to trying to get revelation
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.780]   about the future and about God's secret plans
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.220]   by using demonic means or means
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860]   that involve transactions with the dead.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.860]   Samuel says it is in essence rejecting the word of the Lord.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.340]   The Lord's word is not enough.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.740]   And Samuel says that Saul's disobedience,
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.660]   therefore, is like divination.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.380]   It's like idolatry.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.900]   He puts divination and idolatry in the same category,
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900]   and that's the root issue
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.220]   in using mediums and necromancers.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.780]   It puts the mediums and the necromancers
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.680]   in the place where God belongs.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.940]   God tells us as much as he wants us to know
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.900]   about the secret counsels of his plans for the future.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.380]   So when the prophet Isaiah indicts the people
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.700]   for their involvement with mediums, he says it like this.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.500]   When they say to you, "Inquire of the mediums
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.860]   and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,"
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.860]   should not a people inquire of their God?
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.180]   Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.380]   This is why Samuel calls it idolatry.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.940]   If we go to mediums to find out something about our life
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.460]   that God has withheld from us,
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.220]   we put them in the position that only God should have.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.700]   This is a great abomination, and Samuel calls it idolatry.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.100]   Moses, in Deuteronomy 18.10,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.060]   speaks like this when he goes after mediums.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.700]   "There shall not be found among you
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.380]   anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.140]   or interprets omens or a sorcerer or a charmer
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.060]   or a medium or a necromancer
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.140]   or one who inquires of the dead,
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.520]   for whoever does these things
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.660]   is an abomination to the Lord."
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.660]   So when we get to chapter 28 of 1 Samuel,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.900]   we see that this is exactly what Saul does.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.580]   He does this abomination.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.420]   Even though he has already cast out
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.020]   all the mediums from the kingdom,
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.140]   he disguises himself, he goes at night,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.780]   so he knows he's doing a great evil,
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.860]   but he has sunk this low.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.020]   He asks the medium, the witch of Endor,
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.260]   the medium, the necromancer, to call up Samuel from the dead.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.500]   Samuel has died in the meantime, and she does it,
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.820]   and he sees him, and she sees him,
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.820]   and they know what's happening.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.460]   And Samuel confronts him and predicts he's gonna die
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.740]   in the battle because he's broken the law of God
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.700]   at every level and sunk to the degradation now
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.960]   of using an illegal medium.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.860]   This is the bottom of Saul's degradation,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.460]   and that's the point of the chapter.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.460]   He has sunk this low in spite of all God's privileges to him,
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.220]   and so in his next battle with the Philistines,
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.660]   he is a dead man.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.340]   So the point of this chapter is not that necromancy
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.180]   and divination or the work of mediums is impossible,
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.180]   but that it is to be avoided at all costs by God's people
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.500]   because it is an assault on God's wisdom
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.060]   and authority and love and is therefore in the category
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.300]   of idolatry and rebellion and abomination.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.780]   So I would say to Christine,
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.780]   the Christian answer to witches and mediums and sorcerers
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.260]   and charmers and necromancers and the users of omens
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.500]   and divination and Ouija boards or anything like that,
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   the answer is not that such things are unreal or impossible.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.940]   We're not secularists, we're supernaturalists.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.780]   The point is not that they're unreal,
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.780]   but that you should not in any case participate in them.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.660]   They are evil, they are idolatrous, they are rebellious,
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.380]   they are abominable, to use all the words
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.940]   that the Bible uses, and for that reason,
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.740]   they are to be renounced by the people of God.
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.740]   And those who use them are to be prayed for and pleaded for
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.860]   to step away from that kind of abomination.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.020]   - Yeah, powerful.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.260]   If I recall correctly,
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.880]   this is a very similar line of thinking,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.380]   I think that came up in the episode
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.220]   on what to do with people who claim to die,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.780]   go to heaven, return to earth,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.380]   and then write a book about it.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.100]   That was back in episode number 302,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.000]   when we talked about the book "Heaven is for Real."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.500]   And the weekend for us is here,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.420]   and this is my opportunity to encourage you
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.340]   to subscribe to our podcast and to find our audio feeds
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.020]   and search our episode archive
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.580]   and even reach us by email with a question
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.540]   that you may have on your own.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.300]   Do all these things through our online home
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.500]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.460]   Well, many of us know that God loves us.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.620]   The shed blood of Jesus proves that God loves us.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.320]   But does God actually like me?
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.940]   Or does God just put up with me?
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.900]   That is a profoundly deep question,
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.100]   and we're gonna address it when we return on Monday.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.380]   Don't miss it.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.380]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.820]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you on Monday.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.400]   (upbeat music)
