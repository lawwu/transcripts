[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.860]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.680]   Today, we are discussing fertility.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.040]   We will discuss male fertility and female fertility.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.320]   And I should mention that today's discussion
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400]   is not just for people who are seeking to conceive children
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.920]   or who want to know how their children were conceived,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.480]   but it's really for everybody.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   And I say that because it is the story of all of us.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.460]   All of us are here because a specialized set of cells
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.240]   called germ cells, that is the sperm and the egg,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.320]   and I'll make it very clear why they're called germ cells
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.740]   a little bit later, it has nothing to do with infection,
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.340]   but it's because a sperm cell and an egg cell
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.880]   arrived at one another,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.280]   either in vivo inside of our mother or in vitro,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.640]   so-called in vitro fertilization,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.680]   and then were implanted into our mother and became us.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.880]   And so understanding the process of how the egg cell
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.080]   and the sperm cell came to be is really the key
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680]   to understanding how that fertilization process came to be.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.520]   I know everyone's thinking,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.180]   I know how fertilization occurs.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.120]   It occurs through sexual intercourse and so on.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.220]   And we'll talk a little bit about that,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.380]   but I promise you that if you understand the menstrual cycle
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.760]   and the menstrual cycle in today's conversation
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760]   can best be thought of as a biological cycle
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.000]   that occurs in females that allows the potential
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.860]   for fertilization by the sperm,
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.980]   because that's really what it is.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.040]   And it's a beautifully orchestrated process
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.400]   that I'll describe to you.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   And I should say all people, males and females,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   should really understand how the menstrual cycle works,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.860]   how it impacts fertilization,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.320]   but also how it impacts the brain and body,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.280]   behavior, psychology, et cetera.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.500]   And we will also talk about spermatogenesis,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.700]   how sperm cells come to be and how they arrive,
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580]   that is how they swim to the egg
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.780]   and the incredible interplay between the biology
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.580]   of the sperm and the biology of the egg
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.900]   leads to this incredible thing that we call embryogenesis
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.060]   and the birth of the child.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.300]   And of course, the development of that child
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.260]   into an infant, a toddler, an adolescent,
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.760]   a teen and an adult.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.220]   Today's discussion again is not just for those of you
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620]   that are seeking to have children.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.420]   And I say that because when you look at the data,
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.920]   you look at the literature on longevity and vitality,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.600]   two themes in biology that oftentimes people lump together,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.860]   but aren't always the same.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.020]   For instance, there are a lot of things that we can do
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.700]   to increase our vitality
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.620]   that actually can harm our longevity.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.980]   But there are a subset of biological rules and mechanisms
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.680]   that when aligned, allow us to maximize
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.200]   both our vitality and our longevity.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   And I think it's fair to say
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980]   that all of those mechanisms and tools
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.320]   are housed in the discussion around maximizing fertility.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.080]   And that's true whether or not you're male or female.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.860]   In other words, if you want children or if you don't,
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.260]   if you already have children or if you don't,
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.940]   understanding how fertility and fertilization occurs
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.340]   in the brain and body
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.720]   will allow you to maximize your vitality and longevity.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.260]   And of course, today's discussion will provide
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.160]   an understanding of the biology and many actionable tools
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.960]   that will also help you conceive children
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.040]   if that's your wish.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.880]   So of course, as is characteristic of this podcast,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.040]   we will discuss science-based tools,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.500]   including behavioral tools, both the dos and the don'ts.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.540]   And we will discuss nutrition-based tools
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.260]   and supplementation-based tools and some other practices,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.220]   including things like acupuncture,
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.040]   which have quite good data to support them
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.740]   in terms of improving fertility.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.860]   And we will discuss why those certain practices can work.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.920]   And we will discuss prescription drugs
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580]   that your doctor can prescribe to you.
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.680]   If, for instance, you have a deficit
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.260]   at the level of hormone production
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.400]   or neurotransmitter production at the level of the brain
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.480]   or the pituitary gland,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.860]   I'll explain what all of those things are soon,
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.700]   or the gonads, the ovary and the testes
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.820]   in females and males respectively.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.520]   Again, by the end of today's episode,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.000]   you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.940]   related to maximizing fertility,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.980]   and you will have a lot of knowledge and actionable tools
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.820]   related to maximizing vitality and longevity.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.440]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.180]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.300]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.140]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.540]   to the general public.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.820]   Our first sponsor is Maui Newy Meats.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.760]   Maui Newy Meats, I can confidently say,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.100]   are the most nutrient-dense
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.100]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.740]   Maui Newy spent nearly a decade
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.060]   building a USDA-certified wild harvesting system
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.320]   to help balance invasive deer populations
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.860]   on the island of Maui.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.780]   The solution they built
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.140]   turns the proliferation of an invasive species
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.660]   into a wide range of nutrient-dense products,
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.580]   from fresh butcher cuts and organ meats
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.300]   to bone broth, jerky, and even pet treats.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   Their bone broth has an unmatched 25 grams of protein
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.580]   per 100 calories.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.960]   I've talked before on this podcast,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.540]   and I've had several expert guests come on this podcast,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.780]   to talk about the fact that most people
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.860]   should aim to get one gram of quality protein
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.580]   per pound of body weight per day
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.260]   in order to maximize their health, tissue repair,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.180]   which includes brain tissue repair,
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.140]   and if you're an active exerciser,
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.940]   to support recovery from exercise.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.180]   Maui Newy Meats have an incredible
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.460]   quality protein-to-calorie ratio.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.020]   And I mentioned the bone broth.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.980]   I should also mention that their ground meats
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.380]   and their venison steaks are absolutely delicious,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.060]   and their jerky is absolutely terrific.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.620]   In fact, it's the only jerky that I've eaten consistently
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.980]   that I happen to like consistently over time.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.100]   If you'd like to try Maui Newy Venison,
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.540]   go to mauinueyvenison.com/huberman

[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.300]   Again, that's mauinueyvenison.com/huberman
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.460]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.800]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.620]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.860]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.300]   about the fact that sleep is the fundamental layer
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.500]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.580]   Now, one of the key things
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.960]   for getting a great night's sleep every single night
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.060]   is to optimize the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.500]   Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.820]   your body temperature needs to drop
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.380]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.020]   And waking up, on the other hand,
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.780]   involves a heating of your body
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.740]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.460]   With Eight Sleep, you can tune the temperature
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.660]   of your mattress cover or mattress
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.300]   to be cooler or hotter, depending on whether or not
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.980]   you tend to run too hot or too cold.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.740]   And you can even vary it across the night
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.700]   so that you can access the best deep sleep
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.720]   early in the night, the so-called REM sleep,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.740]   rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.500]   that's more pronounced in the later half of the night.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.300]   And in doing so, really get your sleep optimized,
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.760]   not just in terms of duration, but in terms of quality
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.900]   and the overall architecture of your sleep.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.140]   This has a profound influence on your alertness, focus, mood,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.300]   and many other important factors throughout the day.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.600]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.060]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.800]   to save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.580]   by Momentous Supplements.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.700]   I want to acknowledge that not everybody needs supplements
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.560]   and yet many, many people derive tremendous benefit
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.340]   from proper supplementation.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.980]   I would count myself in that group.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.540]   There are excellent supplements for improving the depth
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.500]   and quality of sleep, for improving focus,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.460]   and for improving energy, and for hormone optimization,
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.860]   and many other factors related to our mental health,
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.500]   physical health, and performance.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.980]   We've partnered with Momentous Supplements
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.180]   for three important reasons.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.700]   First of all, Momentous Supplements
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.260]   are of the very highest quality.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.040]   Second of all, they ship internationally,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.380]   and we know that many of you reside
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.860]   outside of the United States.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.540]   And third, they focus on single ingredient formulations.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.760]   This is very important.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.700]   There is a place for blends, but in most cases,
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.580]   if you're going to develop a supplement protocol,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.100]   you want it to be single ingredient formulation
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.300]   so that you can adjust the dosages of different things
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.200]   according to what works and doesn't work for you,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.820]   which is essentially impossible to do
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.640]   if you are using multi-ingredient formulations.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.300]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.620]   and that we've discussed here on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.780]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.500]   so livemomentous.com/huberman,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.660]   and get 20% off any supplements.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.540]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.780]   Let's talk about fertility.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.500]   And in doing so, let's take a step back
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.580]   from this word fertility and ask,
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.740]   what is fertility and fertilization really all about?
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.700]   Well, the obvious answer
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.920]   is that it's about producing offspring.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.940]   But more importantly, it's about producing offspring
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.780]   that contain the genetic components of both parents
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.780]   and indeed contain half of the genes from one parent
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.920]   and half of the genes from another parent.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.960]   Now, there are two general types of cells in the body.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.440]   The most common types of cells in the body
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440]   are called somatic cells.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.200]   So this would be all the cells in your body
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.980]   except the egg in females and the sperm in males.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.300]   The egg in females and the sperm in males
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.020]   are part of what's called the germ line.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.980]   And again, it has nothing to do with infection.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.660]   It's just that the cells of the germ line
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.780]   have genes that cannot be modified by the behavior
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.260]   of the individual that houses those genes.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.140]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.700]   Well, if I were to tell you that by exercising,
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.780]   you can improve mitochondrial function,
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.600]   you can change hormones.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.980]   By reducing stress, you can reduce cortisol.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.100]   By hitting puberty, for instance,
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.260]   you will have the secretion of hormones
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.140]   that then change gene expression in other cells
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.160]   leading to development of body hair, facial hair,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.920]   deepening the voice, breast growth, et cetera.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.940]   You'd say, okay, great, that all makes perfect sense.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.720]   But that's all occurring in the so-called somatic cells.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.960]   The germ cells or the germline cells,
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.080]   that is the egg and the sperm,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.040]   are a very unique and protected set of cells
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.600]   that are generated in a particular way
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.320]   and whose genetic components
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.040]   are not modifiable by experience.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.440]   And when you take a step back and you think about it,
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.480]   you say, oh, that's right.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.120]   There's no reason to think that exercising
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.440]   will make the children that you have not yet had stronger.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.280]   Of course not.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.100]   Well, why is that?
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.360]   Well, that's because there is a barrier
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.080]   between the genes of the germline cells and behaviors.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.120]   They cannot be modified by behaviors
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.460]   and the various things that you do in your lifetime.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.860]   Now, I suppose there's an exception
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.960]   in the negative direction.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.280]   And what I'm referring to here is
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.240]   if you were to say be exposed to a chemical
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.300]   that could mutate the DNA of your egg or sperm,
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.360]   or if you were to fertilize an embryo in a certain way
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.580]   or at a certain stage of life
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.700]   that it got an extra chromosome, for instance,
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.280]   we'll talk about this a little bit later,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.900]   well, then of course you could end up with offspring
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.880]   that have modified DNA
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.100]   that don't faithfully represent half of the genes from mom
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.340]   and half of the genes from dad,
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.420]   but that's not the same as specific behaviors
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.540]   modifying the genes of those cells,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.340]   the sperm and the egg cells,
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.700]   in a way that improves the offspring.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.920]   So the key first thing to understand today
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.760]   is that there's a distinction between somatic cells,
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.420]   which is the vast majority of cells in your body
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.580]   and the so-called germline cells,
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.780]   which are the egg and the sperm.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.860]   The egg and the sperm
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.660]   are these highly protected populations of cells
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.660]   that in females actually come to be during embryogenesis.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.340]   Okay, so for all females out there,
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.060]   you generate what today I'm going to refer to
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.420]   as a vault of cells.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.800]   You have a vault of eggs that are your germline.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   Those eggs all contain all the chromosomes of your DNA.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.680]   So it's going to be, as most of you know,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.560]   there are 23 chromosomes
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.320]   and chromosomes exist in pairs.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.520]   So the way to think about this is each pair is one strand
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.600]   and you have 22 so-called autosomes
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.360]   and then you have one sex chromosome.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.340]   The sex chromosome will be either X or Y.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.620]   So in a female, they have two X chromosomes.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.080]   So in each one of the eggs that a woman has
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.740]   and that she's had since she was an embryo
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.620]   and that's contained in this vault,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.620]   those eggs are of course going to be very immature
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.480]   at birth, right?
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.940]   She hasn't undergone puberty yet
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.680]   and certainly as an embryo, she hasn't undergone puberty
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.980]   and those cells are going to contain
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.680]   23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.880]   Okay, this is very important.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.120]   23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.260]   The chromosomes are essentially the wrapped up DNA
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.340]   that contains all the genetic information
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.140]   to create any cell type in the body
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.360]   and actually to create an entirely new individual.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.220]   Now there are 23 pairs of chromosomes,
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.540]   22 of which are called autosomes.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.800]   Okay, if that doesn't make sense to you,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.180]   just remember autosome, okay, there's 22 of them
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.480]   and then there's one so-called sex chromosome.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.920]   The sex chromosomes are either X or Y, but this is a female.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.460]   So she's going to have 23 pairs of chromosomes
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.020]   and she's going to have two X chromosomes
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.020]   for the sex chromosomes.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.120]   Okay, if this is already confusing to you, don't worry.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.220]   I'll make it very clear how this all relates to fertility
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.940]   and how it relates to chromosomal segregation
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.700]   and a bunch of things that I think maybe you've heard of
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.120]   and that perhaps were opaque to you,
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.180]   but I promise to make them clear.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.240]   But just understand that within each of those eggs,
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.640]   they have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.780]   And for those of you that like nomenclature,
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.420]   I'll tell you that those cells are considered diploid,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.820]   they're called the diploid.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.180]   And that means that they have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.820]   As distinguished from cells that are haploid,
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.060]   where there's only one set of those 23 chromosomes.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.160]   So instead of 23 pairs, there's only 23 chromosomes.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.060]   We'll come back to haploid cells a little bit later.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.020]   Okay, so when a female is born,
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.140]   she has all these eggs in the reserve, in this vault
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.580]   that she'll have for her entire life.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.300]   She's not going to make any more,
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.260]   but they are very, very immature.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.740]   So when a woman is in embryogenesis,
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.040]   she develops these very immature eggs, okay?
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.820]   Today, we're also going to talk about follicles
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.820]   and we will be careful to distinguish follicles from eggs.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.740]   They're often talked about interchangeably
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.320]   online and elsewhere, and even by fertility docs and OBGYNs.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.780]   But right now we're just talking about the egg cells, okay?
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.740]   The eggs themselves, which are cells.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.620]   Now, the goal of fertilization is to bring that egg cell
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.360]   into close enough proximity that it can be fertilized
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.340]   by a single sperm cell.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.820]   And that sperm cell will bring 23 chromosomes as well,
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.740]   that include, just as in the female egg,
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.140]   it'll have 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.820]   And in the male, that sex chromosome
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.380]   can either be an X chromosome,
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.380]   which then would give rise to female offspring,
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.020]   or a Y chromosome, which would give rise to male offspring.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.580]   And today we're not talking about sexual differentiation.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.560]   That's a topic of a previous and yet another future episode.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.940]   But just to give you a sense of how X chromosomes
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.220]   and Y chromosomes can actually accomplish
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.740]   that sexual differentiation, both of body and brain.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.700]   I'll just mention in two sentences that, for instance,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.560]   if there's a Y chromosome as opposed to an X chromosome,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.060]   that Y chromosome contains genes that suppress,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.040]   for instance, the development of female genitalia,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.560]   and thereby give rise to male genitalia.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.220]   So rather than the formation of a clitoris,
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.940]   it's the formation of a penis.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.580]   And rather than the formation of ovaries,
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.260]   the formation of a testes, okay?
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.940]   So that's more directed towards sexual differentiation.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.080]   We're not going to get into that right now.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.220]   We'll get into that in a future episode.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.480]   But even if you're only tracking about 10%
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.020]   of what I'm saying right now, I promise you're doing great.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.620]   If you're tracking more than 10%,
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.220]   well, then you're doing terrifically well.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.740]   Because the essence of fertility and fertilization
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.240]   is to bring together that haploid cell that is the sperm,
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.260]   that only has 23 chromosomes,
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.540]   but not pairs of chromosomes, right?
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.540]   'Cause that's the DNA from dad, together with the egg,
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.000]   which is, I told you already, has 23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.020]   So part of the fertilization process has to be
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.140]   to get rid of one half of those 23 pairs in the female.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.540]   You got to get rid of it.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.840]   And you have to get the egg and the sperm in proximity
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.380]   so that the egg can potentially be fertilized
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.780]   by the sperm bringing the DNA,
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.260]   the 23 single strands of chromosomes from dad
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.060]   into a cell that has 23 single strands from mom, okay?
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.660]   So I realize I'm probably being
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.740]   a little bit repetitive here,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.340]   but I want everyone to understand this
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.580]   'cause it really frames up fertility and reproduction
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.860]   in the proper way.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.420]   We've got a cell from mom, the egg,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.940]   which has 23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.820]   We need to get rid of one set of those pairs
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.860]   so that there's only 23 chromosomes.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.500]   We need to get rid of half of those chromosomes.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.660]   And then we need to bring that cell together physically
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.180]   with the sperm cell that contains
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.800]   the 23 chromosomal strands from dad.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.940]   And we need to bring those together
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.860]   so that you get 23 chromosomal pairs from dad
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.180]   and 23 chromosomal pairs from mom.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.920]   And in doing so, you create a cell,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.580]   which then becomes multiple cells.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.360]   That's going to be the developing embryo
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.600]   that has half the genes from mom
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.220]   and half the genes from dad.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.640]   So I hope that's clear.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.920]   That is the biological logic,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.540]   which I realize is a bit of a tongue twister,
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.880]   but forgive me,
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.800]   it is the most accurate way to describe this process.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.400]   We're trying to bring together
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.700]   the 23 single strands of chromosomes from dad
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.960]   and the 23 single strands of chromosomes from mom
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.040]   into the same cell.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.820]   Now that requires a literal physical contact
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.520]   and pairing of the two cells.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.420]   But as I mentioned before,
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.740]   all these eggs in mom are sitting in a vault
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.660]   and they're very, very immature.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.460]   So the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.980]   are really about first eliminating
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.640]   half of the chromosomal pairs
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.700]   in that 23 sets of chromosomes
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.180]   and not getting rid of, for instance,
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.180]   half just going one to 11 or 12 to 23.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.300]   That's not the goal.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.780]   The goal is to have chromosomes one, two, three, four,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.920]   five, six, all the way up to 23,
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.140]   but only to have half of the chromosomes there.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.240]   And to bring that cell together
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.340]   with the sperm cell physically,
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.980]   then allow them to fuse
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.940]   and allow the chromosomes from dad
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.060]   and the chromosomes from mom
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.320]   to fuse within a single cell
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.060]   and duplicate into cells that contain
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.620]   half of the chromosomes from dad
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.340]   and half of the chromosomes from mom.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.340]   That's what the ovulatory and menstrual cycle
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.940]   are really all about.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.140]   So when thinking about it that way,
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.040]   I'd like to just initiate the discussion
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.960]   by focusing first on the female component
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.040]   or the egg component of fertility and fertilization.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.400]   As I mentioned before, a female has all the eggs,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.300]   albeit very immature eggs that she's going to have
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.420]   at the time that she's born.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.500]   Now, puberty will happen at some point
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.460]   and will allow the ovulatory
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.260]   and the menstrual cycle to commence.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.240]   Now, one question that you perhaps are asking is
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.040]   what controls the onset of puberty?
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.100]   And there are a number of different results,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.680]   each of which could be an entire episode
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.180]   of a podcast on its own.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.460]   But I'll just highlight a few things that we know
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.780]   about the onset of menses or menstruation,
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.420]   or it's sometimes also called menarche, all right?
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.100]   One thing that you'll notice about today's discussion
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.980]   is that if you were to take any number of your notes online
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.340]   and put them into a search function,
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.700]   that you would see a lot of different language used
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.540]   for the same thing.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.780]   So for instance, some people will talk about
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.660]   the egg and the follicle as the same thing,
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.900]   even though they are not.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.200]   I'll explain the difference soon.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.460]   Some people will talk about menses or menstruation
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.060]   or menarche is the exact same thing.
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.360]   And in fact, they are not the exact same thing,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.280]   but oftentimes these words are used interchangeably.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.220]   I'll do my best today to not overload you with nomenclature,
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.000]   but rather to use the most commonly used terms
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.980]   for the different aspects of fertility and fertilization.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.860]   But when it comes to the onset of puberty,
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.320]   first of all, most of you have probably heard
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.840]   that the onset of puberty is happening much earlier
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.180]   in females now than it was some years ago.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.220]   And in fact, that is the case.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.620]   And I'll talk about some statistics related to this,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.180]   which are pretty striking,
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.760]   but don't necessarily point to anything detrimental.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.380]   It doesn't necessarily mean that something bad is happening.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.320]   What do we know for sure?
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.260]   Well, we know that there are a number of signals
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.460]   that come both through the brain and through the body
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.440]   and more likely both in order to control
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.300]   the onset of puberty in females.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.500]   A couple of examples.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.460]   The first is a mechanistic one.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.340]   We know for instance, that the entire process
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.420]   of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.780]   is initiated from the brain.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.340]   We're going to get into this in a lot more detail
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.760]   in a few minutes, but there's a certain number of hormones
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.140]   and neurotransmitters that are communicated from the brain,
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.860]   a structure called the hypothalamus,
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.780]   which roughly sits above the roof of your mouth.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.180]   And that communicates with a gland, an endocrine
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.620]   or hormone releasing gland called the pituitary gland.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.020]   The pituitary gland looks like a stalk
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.900]   that essentially extends out of the brain.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.060]   It's also located not far from the roof of your mouth.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.820]   And that has two sort of small marble
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.480]   or grape-sized protrusions,
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.900]   the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.320]   And they release different hormones into the bloodstream.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.540]   Puberty is in part controlled by the fact
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.900]   that up until puberty, there are neurons in the hypothalamus
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.940]   that release a neurotransmitter called GABA,
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.940]   which is inhibitory.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.220]   And that prevents the neurons in the hypothalamus
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.860]   from releasing a very important hormone
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.260]   called gonadotropin-releasing hormone or GnRH.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.640]   So the first thing I'd really like everyone to know
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.540]   and commit to memory today is very easy.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.880]   GnRH stands for gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.420]   This comes from the brain and will communicate
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   to the pituitary to release certain hormones.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.140]   Prior to puberty in both males and females,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.660]   there are neurons in the brain
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.180]   that are actively suppressing the neurons
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.480]   that release GnRH.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.340]   It's like no puberty, no puberty, no puberty.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.840]   Can't have puberty, can't have puberty.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.340]   And in fact, those cells are releasing
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.300]   this neurotransmitter called GABA because it's inhibitory,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.620]   prevents the firing of those neurons.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.140]   So puberty is actively suppressed up until a certain point.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.900]   It's also actively suppressed at least in some species.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.380]   And we think at least partially in humans,
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.800]   by the tonic release, that means the ongoing release
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.540]   around the clock of a hormone called melatonin.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.640]   Later in life, in fact, after puberty,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.300]   melatonin will be secreted only in the dark phase
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.240]   of each night and around the time that one goes to sleep.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.460]   But in children and in particular in children
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.960]   prior to puberty, melatonin is released
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.820]   more or less constantly.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.260]   Now, melatonin isn't the only source of suppression
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.460]   of puberty, it's also these neural mechanisms
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.980]   involving GABA, but it is certainly a great candidate
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.500]   for one of the reasons why puberty
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.480]   doesn't generally tend to happen at say age four, age five.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.820]   That would be very unusual.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:07.600]   Another component of suppression of puberty
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.480]   is that typically in children,
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.700]   they have relatively low body fat stores.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.700]   Why is this important?
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.140]   Well, we know that one of the things
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.780]   that can trigger the onset of puberty,
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.820]   in particular in females,
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.340]   is that when enough body fat accumulates,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.780]   that body fat releases a hormone called leptin.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.500]   And that hormone leptin travels in the bloodstream
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.340]   across the blood brain barrier and goes to the hypothalamus
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.940]   and can trigger the onset of puberty
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.980]   by activating the neurons
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.620]   that release gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.300]   So many people believe that one of the reasons
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.800]   that puberty is happening earlier and earlier in females
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.260]   is because of the accumulation of more body fat
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.180]   at younger ages than was observed 30 or 40
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.940]   and certainly 100 years ago.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.660]   Now I can already imagine a number of people are thinking,
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.900]   oh, this must relate to the obesity crisis.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.780]   And indeed there is a crisis of obesity.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.780]   Obesity is something that is causing all sorts of problems
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.060]   with people's health at various levels, brain and body.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.700]   And that is far more frequent today
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.760]   than it was even 20 years ago.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.120]   So it is indeed a crisis
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.360]   because it has enormous detrimental effects
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.340]   for so many aspects of brain and body health and longevity.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.840]   But this whole process of thinking about body fat
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.380]   signaling leptin to the hypothalamus
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.880]   and the onset of puberty doesn't necessarily
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.440]   have to do with the obesity crisis.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.480]   It might relate, but it could also relate to, for instance,
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.300]   improved nutrition, which is allowing body fat stores
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.840]   to accumulate, maybe not to the level of obesity,
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.640]   but to accumulate earlier and at younger ages in females,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.400]   which is then causing earlier puberty in females.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.680]   To just highlight how that might be possible,
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.380]   I want to review some data that talk about
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.780]   the onset of menses, menstruation, that is puberty,
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.480]   in females according to country and according to age
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.920]   over the last 100 or more years.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.400]   So what are the general trends
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.180]   in terms of the onset of puberty in females?
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.960]   Well, that's an easy one to answer.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.100]   Over the last 100 years or so,
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.400]   the onset of puberty has been occurring much earlier
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.880]   with each passing decade.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.400]   It's really an incredible set of statistics.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.680]   I will provide a link to these data
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.040]   since I know a number of you are listening
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.720]   and not just watching on YouTube.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.400]   This is from a study in which the onset of puberty
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.200]   has been analyzed from as early as the 1850s, right?
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.580]   In certain countries, there are data on that.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.920]   Out to the 1970s in another country starting at about 1900,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.480]   extending out to about 1990.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.020]   These are ongoing collections of data,
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.060]   but just to give you a sense how the data are falling out
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.440]   in a couple of different countries,
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.160]   just to give you a flavor.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.180]   But for those of you listening
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.260]   and for those of you watching,
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.420]   the essence of all of these findings
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.840]   is that puberty is happening much, much earlier
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.120]   with each passing decade.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.560]   So for instance, in the United States,
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.080]   around 1900 or 1903, the average age of men are,
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   the onset of puberty in females was about 14 years old.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.940]   Whereas in 1990, the average age is 11.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.600]   So that's a pretty significant,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   we can say acceleration of the onset of puberty.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.960]   Now, of course, these are averages,
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.400]   so there will be exceptions.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.600]   There's a distribution of data.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.040]   Today still, there will be young females
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.460]   who will undergo puberty at age 11 or 10,
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.820]   or maybe even nine and others who will undergo puberty
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.420]   at age 13, 14, maybe even 16 or 17.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.880]   However, if we look at, for instance, the data from Norway,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.400]   which dates back quite far,
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.680]   they have excellent record keeping to 1850.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.760]   What we see is that the average age
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.800]   of the onset of female puberty in 1850 in Norway
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.720]   was 17 years old.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.700]   Whereas in 1970, it's 13 years old.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.360]   So this is a dramatic acceleration of the onset of puberty.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.540]   And you see a similar trend in other countries as well.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.100]   So if we were to look in, for instance, in the UK,
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.000]   they have a smaller data set,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.760]   meaning it only extends back to about 1940,
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.200]   but the average age of the onset of puberty in the UK
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.680]   in 1940 was 13 and a half years old.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.640]   Again, this is just for females.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.500]   And in 1970, it was closer to 13
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.880]   with a trend towards declining even further.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.920]   Unfortunately, they didn't continue
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.840]   to collect data out to 2022.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.040]   And as a final point, if we were to look at,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.420]   for instance, in Germany and Finland,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.960]   the average onset of puberty in 1870
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   was 16 and a half years old.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.200]   By 1940, it was down to 13 and a half years old.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.240]   So all of these data have borne out over and over again,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.940]   regardless of location in the world,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.440]   which is important because when you start to think
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.920]   about the obesity crisis, you can say, well,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.720]   that's mainly in developed countries, believe it or not,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.260]   or perhaps not surprisingly.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.500]   And maybe it has to do with the obesity crisis.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.300]   And yet I don't think we can conclude that at all.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.660]   Something is happening.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.140]   However, it could be increased body fat stores
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.640]   due to overeating and obesity.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.360]   However, it could also be unrelated to obesity.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.340]   It could be, for instance, improved nutrition
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.220]   and the availability of quality nutrition,
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.260]   which can signal the maturation
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.780]   of the brain and body mechanisms
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.000]   that trigger the onset of puberty,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.880]   ovulatory cycle and menstruation.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.340]   So we want to be very careful about leaping to conclusions
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.560]   about what these trends mean,
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.760]   but the trends themselves are very, very apparent.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.660]   And as a final point, I should also mention
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.920]   that there are a number of different behavioral
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.080]   and psychosocial, as they're called,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.640]   interactions that can influence puberty as well.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.500]   This has been most strikingly observed in animals.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.340]   And so I don't want anyone to be alarmed
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.180]   or to leap to any great conclusions
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.680]   about the onset of timing of puberty in humans,
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.520]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.680]   about a certain result,
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   which shows that if a young female is exposed to the odor,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.140]   not necessarily the pheromones, right?
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.740]   There's a distinction between odors that we perceive
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.820]   and pheromones, which are subconscious, right?
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.360]   We don't actively perceive, but that can impact our biology.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.520]   And pheromone effects in humans are very controversial.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   But we know, for instance, that if you take a female animal,
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.680]   and there's some evidence from humans
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.780]   that if you take a young pre-pubertal female
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.320]   and you expose her to the scent
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.780]   of a reproductively competent male
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.060]   for a series of days,
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.940]   but maybe even as short as a few hours,
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.660]   and she is also not regularly being exposed
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.720]   to the scent of her father,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.000]   that she can undergo puberty earlier.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.840]   That's right.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.680]   There is something about the odor and/or pheromones,
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.840]   or perhaps something else that occurs
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.360]   when a young pre-pubertal female has a father
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.680]   that she's in regular contact with,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.160]   he wouldn't necessarily have to live at home,
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.760]   but that is around a lot that his smell, excuse me,
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.780]   is registered by her biological systems
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.960]   that I don't want to say protects
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.120]   because it kind of skews the valence of the conversation,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   but that offsets or buffers the otherwise observed effect,
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.800]   which is that the scent of a reproductively competent male,
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.060]   if it's present often enough or perhaps intensely enough,
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.380]   that it can trigger the onset of puberty in that female.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.160]   In other words, the scent of a male that is not the father,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   and we think also that is not biologically related to her,
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.040]   can trigger earlier onset of puberty,
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.520]   and that effect can at least be partially buffered
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.040]   by her being in the presence of the scent
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   from her biological father.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.520]   Now, some of you are probably already leaping to conclusions
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.440]   about what this means.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.240]   Should you not allow your daughter to be exposed
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.840]   to any males who are of reproductive age, et cetera?
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.800]   And that's certainly not what I'm saying.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.220]   There's a huge number of considerations
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.720]   that go into that calculation for everybody
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.600]   in circumstances, et cetera.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.080]   But the point is that the odors of individuals,
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.320]   both related, in particular closely related
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.520]   and non-related individuals,
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.400]   can shape the neural systems and the hormone systems
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.920]   that can trigger the onset of puberty
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.660]   or suppress the onset of puberty.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.860]   So whether or not we're talking about onset of puberty
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.020]   at this age or that age,
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.100]   and whether or not biologically related male
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.580]   or non-biologically related male scents around, et cetera,
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.040]   the thing I want everyone to know
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.900]   is that at some point during development,
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:32.900]   typically nowadays between the ages of 11 and 15 or so,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   again, there's variability there,
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.600]   the suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.800]   released from the hypothalamus is removed.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.520]   And then gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.240]   can activate cells within the pituitary.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.420]   And if you really want to know,
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.920]   it's the anterior pituitary in particular,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.360]   and then the anterior pituitary gland,
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.280]   which sits at and kind of bridges the brain and the body,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.100]   because it allows the release of hormones
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.420]   into the bloodstream,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.780]   that anterior pituitary is going to release two key hormones
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.360]   that everyone should know the name of and what they do.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.560]   And when I say everyone, I mean,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.320]   males and females need to know about these hormones
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.000]   because they have an active role in both males and females.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.400]   And of course, you should want to know
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.200]   and should know about the biology
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.000]   of everyone on the planet, in my opinion,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.920]   because it tells you a lot more about humans
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.960]   than if you just focus on your own biology.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.500]   But those two hormones are called luteinizing hormone,
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.280]   which is abbreviated LH,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.760]   and follicle-stimulating hormone,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.840]   which is abbreviated FSH, okay?
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.840]   So the simple picture that you need to have in your mind
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.200]   is gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the brain,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.560]   from the hypothalamus in particular,
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.960]   is causing the release of luteinizing hormone
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.040]   and follicle-stimulating hormone.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.040]   GNRH stimulates LH, luteinizing hormone,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.120]   and follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.920]   LH and FSH travel in the blood
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.220]   and can access all the cells and tissues of the body.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.520]   This is one of the incredible things about hormones
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.480]   is that many hormones and LH and FSH
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.800]   are included in this group, can travel into cells,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.480]   and they can actually change the genetic expression
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.320]   of those cells.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.880]   They can change which genes are turned on
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.920]   and which genes are turned off,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.640]   and they can also attach to the surface of those cells
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.320]   and make those cells take on different properties.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.640]   So they can mature those cells.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.680]   So for instance, a good example of this
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.060]   outside of the context we've been talking about
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.460]   is the hormone testosterone can travel to the hair follicle
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.160]   and can stimulate changes in the genes
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   of the cells of the hair follicle that can make hair grow.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.880]   A different hormone, estrogen,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.840]   can travel to the cells of the breast tissue
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.920]   and activate genes that control enlargement
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.480]   of the cells of the breast tissue.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.760]   Prolactin, a different hormone,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.480]   can travel to the mammary ducts
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.180]   and control the production and the secretion of milk.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.400]   And in males, that can actually happen in certain cases,
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.240]   although it's rare, but prolactin can also travel
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   to areas of the brain that control libido, for instance.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.380]   And just so you'll never forget it,
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.400]   males' elevated levels of prolactin
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.500]   are actually what set the refractory period
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.600]   after ejaculation and prevent erection
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.960]   for some period of time.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.620]   So you'll never forget prolactin.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.140]   The point being that different hormones
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.840]   have different effects on different cells,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.660]   depending on what cells those are, right?
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.640]   Estrogen or estradiol is going to have different effects
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.440]   on the breast tissue than it would on skin,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.940]   although it has effects on both.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.740]   Similarly, when LH and FSH, luteinizing hormone
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.280]   and follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.840]   travel in the blood to the gonad,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.840]   and the gonad is an ovary,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.860]   it will have a certain set of consequences.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.020]   And when luteinizing hormone
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.580]   and follicle stimulating hormone travel in the blood
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.640]   to a gonad and that gonad happens to be a testy,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.800]   then it will have a different set
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.720]   of biological implications.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.680]   So let's focus now on what happens
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.000]   when LH and FSH arrive at the ovary.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.980]   And let's assume now that we're talking about a female
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.920]   who has already undergone puberty,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.500]   or perhaps we could even frame this in the context
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.600]   of a female who is about to undergo puberty.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.200]   FSH and LH are now able to be released
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.260]   because she's undergoing puberty,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.400]   but the same set of processes essentially would occur
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.480]   for any point from puberty onward until menopause,
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.000]   which is the depletion of that vault,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.680]   that ovarian reserve of all those immature eggs.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.080]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.880]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.300]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.560]   and adaptogens.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.660]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.780]   So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.880]   every single day.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.240]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.080]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.220]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens,
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.200]   is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.840]   So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not,
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.560]   I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   for vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.520]   adaptogens to combat stress,
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.140]   and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.700]   I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.080]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.920]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.440]   And for the month of January,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.460]   they have a special offer
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.020]   where they'll give you 10 free travel packs,
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.540]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.680]   Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function,
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.480]   metabolic function, hormone health,
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.900]   but also calcium regulation and heart health.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.880]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.100]   to claim their special offer in the month of January
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.420]   of 10 free travel packs,
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.340]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.760]   Okay, so we're now going to talk about
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.000]   ovulation and menstruation,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and let's just remember what this is all about.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.800]   This is all about creating the potential
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.240]   for an egg to be fertilized,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.220]   and that egg needs to have half of the chromosomal pair.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.160]   So no pairs,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.240]   but it's got to have 23 chromosomes just from mom.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.540]   And we need to position that egg
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.760]   so that the egg can be met by the sperm,
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.000]   and that sperm can penetrate that egg
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and donate its 23 individual strands of chromosomes
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.800]   to that egg so that you can bring together
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.440]   the DNA of dad and the DNA of mom.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.600]   So the ovulatory and menstrual cycle occurs
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.360]   when luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.240]   have been released,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.920]   and the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.880]   and here I have to kind of pick what I want to call it.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   I guess to be really accurate,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.480]   we would just call it the female reproductive cycle,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.720]   but that includes underneath it,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.640]   but the menstrual cycle, as it's sometimes called,
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.840]   and the ovulatory cycle.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.100]   So you decide, I'm going to interchangeably discuss
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.680]   the ovulatory cycle and the menstrual cycle.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.180]   The problem is when you say menstruation,
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.960]   people often think about just the period,
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.640]   the shedding of the uterine lining
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.660]   when fertilization has not occurred.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.480]   So if I start saying ovulatory cycle,
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   just keep in mind I'm referring to the entire thing.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   Now, this is probably also a good opportunity to say
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.320]   that if you heard that the ovulatory/menstrual cycle
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.840]   is 28 days long, that's true in some cases,
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.280]   but that's not always true.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.300]   It's on average 28 days long.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.160]   There are some females for which the ovulatory cycle
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.860]   will be shorter, can be as short as 21 days,
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.520]   and other females for which it will be 35 days long.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.560]   Shorter than 21 days and longer than 35 days is rare,
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.760]   although it does occur.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.560]   One of the key things when thinking about fertility
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.560]   is if you talk to OB/GYNs who are focused on fertility,
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.800]   which I have in anticipation of this episode,
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.660]   they'll tell you that whether or not your cycle
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.860]   is 21 days long or 35 days long
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.560]   is not as much of an issue necessarily
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.800]   unless it's happening to become much shorter
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.880]   or much longer in a kind of erratic way.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.280]   So if you're somebody who's consistently had
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.140]   23 day long cycles and all of a sudden
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.640]   you're having 30 day long cycles,
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.480]   that's not necessarily an indication of anything bad,
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.800]   but if it's 21 days, one month,
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.200]   and it's 30 days the next month,
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.300]   and that's 17 days the next month,
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.660]   or even if it's always falling
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.060]   within that 21 to 35 day long cycle,
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.340]   but it's very variable from each month
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.760]   or every other month or so,
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.900]   you probably want to talk to your OB/GYN
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.040]   because that could indicate a number of different things.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.280]   Which things could it indicate?
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.860]   Well, that will become clear as I spell out the biology
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.300]   in a bit more detail, okay?
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.640]   But this idea that the menstrual cycle,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.300]   ovulatory cycle is always 28 days, that's just false.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.840]   That's just not true.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.380]   I should also mention that there is a common misconception
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.360]   that because the average menstrual cycle is 28 days,
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.320]   indeed the average is 28 days,
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.740]   and the lunar cycle is 28 days,
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.140]   and of course there is real biology
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.760]   to support the fact that the lunar cycle
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.560]   can in fact impact certain aspects of human behavior.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.520]   It does, and we'll talk about lunar cycles
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.940]   in a future episode,
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.180]   but there is zero data to support the idea
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.100]   that the menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.800]   are linked in any kind of causal way.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.580]   I'm sorry to break it to you,
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.500]   the lunar cycle and the tidal cycles at the ocean
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.700]   are definitely linked in ways that are super interesting
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.540]   related to the tilt of the earth
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.500]   and the pull of gravity of different planets,
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.160]   and it's an incredible story into itself,
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.240]   but the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle,
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.500]   despite having some weak correlation
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:18.340]   in terms of their duration or their so-called periodicity,
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.320]   no pun intended,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.820]   well, there's no causal relationship whatsoever
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.360]   between the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.880]   If any of you are aware of any real data
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.600]   that conflict with what I just said,
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.540]   please put that in the comment section on YouTube,
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.440]   but this is pretty well established as far as I know.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.280]   Okay, so we need to bring together
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.060]   the so-called haploid contents,
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.700]   the 23 individual strands of chromosomes from the egg
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.120]   to a place in a position
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.420]   where it could potentially be fertilized by the male.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.520]   So what happens?
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.920]   Luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.580]   travel to the ovary.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.340]   These hormones are able to access the ovary.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.020]   There's a lot of blood supply to the ovary,
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:03.640]   and FSH and LH arrive at the ovary.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.160]   The ovary has this vault,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.840]   this ovarian reserve of immature cells.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.500]   They reside within what are called follicles.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.720]   The follicles are little spherical packages
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.680]   that can potentially provide a nice environment
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.900]   for those eggs to mature.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.900]   And when FSH in particular arrives at the ovary,
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.000]   a small number of those follicles
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.880]   will split off from the reserve.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.040]   They will exit the vault and they will undergo maturation.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.640]   And the key player here is follicle stimulating hormone.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.720]   And the first 14 days of the menstrual ovulatory cycle
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.360]   is referred to as the follicular phase
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.520]   because of this relationship between FSH
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.920]   triggering the maturation of a subset of follicles.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.740]   Now, typically in the context of a 28 day or so
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.300]   ovulatory menstrual cycle,
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.320]   day one is designated as the first day of the period
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.480]   of the shedding of the uterine lining
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.280]   from the previous ovulatory menstrual cycle
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.180]   in which fertilization did not occur, okay?
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.100]   So day one is when the period initiates.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.000]   It is days one through 14 approximately, right?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.940]   'Cause here we're just considering
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.320]   the average of a 28 day cycle,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.000]   but it could be longer, it could be shorter.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.120]   But the first half of that cycle
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.480]   is the so-called follicular phase.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.000]   FSH has triggered the departure of a subset
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.860]   of these follicles that contain immature eggs.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.820]   And it is triggering the maturation of those eggs.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.320]   Luteinizing hormone is also present,
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.560]   but also at relatively low levels.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.600]   And it's during the first half
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.620]   of this ovulatory menstrual cycle
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.440]   that the main goal is to get those follicles to mature.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.640]   So inside of those follicles, the egg is developing,
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.480]   it's growing, it's maturing.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.200]   And in doing so, it's also making its own hormones.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.020]   This I think is one of the most elegant aspects
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.040]   of the ovulatory menstrual cycle
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.120]   that in a few minutes you'll learn about something
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.160]   which still to this day,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.560]   even though I've known about this stuff for decades now
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.360]   because of my training, still just blows my mind
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.920]   that you have one hormone, follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.520]   triggering the maturation of some eggs
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.520]   inside of some follicles.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.920]   And then those follicles themselves making another hormone
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.220]   that furthers the process.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.880]   And then soon, as you'll learn,
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.720]   create a hormone to trigger the second half of the process.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.640]   Just a beautiful symphony of expression of different genes
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.800]   and different hormones to make everything work
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.320]   as optimally as possible.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.780]   So as these different follicles mature somehow,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.000]   and we still don't know exactly how,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.880]   one of those follicles containing an egg gets selected.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.920]   It's either because it matures the fastest
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.080]   or there's something about it
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.420]   that is still not completely understood
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.560]   that allows it to be selected.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.420]   And all the other follicles that are maturing
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.560]   degenerate and die, and they're gone.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.020]   They don't go back into the ovarian reserve.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.140]   They are now depleted from that bank account
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.260]   that is the ovarian reserve.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.540]   They die off, but that single egg
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.600]   that keep in mind contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, right?
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.360]   We haven't gotten rid of one half of those 23 sets
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.800]   of chromosomes yet, but that one will continue to mature.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.600]   And then at some point,
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:26.320]   that egg will start to undergo a process
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.380]   in which those chromosomes are pulled apart
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:33.580]   by little components within the egg called spindles.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.420]   They literally have a physical pulling
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.440]   of the chromosomes apart.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.780]   So now those 23 pairs are no longer attached
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.820]   to one another at the middle like they were before,
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.380]   like two beads of strings,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.440]   or I should say 23 short strands of beads
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.560]   that were at once connected to one another
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.220]   now are pulled apart so that you have 23 chromosomes
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.780]   on each side, but they're pulled apart from one another.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:03.780]   So that diploid cell is now starting to become a cell
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.700]   in which half of the chromosomes,
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.000]   half of those 23 pairs are physically pulled away
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.200]   from the others.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.520]   And then the egg actually starts to form its own,
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.080]   what we call an involution of membrane
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.020]   around those 23 pairs, one set of them,
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.480]   and encapsulates them.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.640]   So you've sort of got an egg with two parts
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.120]   where the two sets of chromosomes,
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.040]   two sets of 23 chromosomes are now separate
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.020]   from one another inside of the egg.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.960]   And then one of those actually gets ejected from the egg.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.320]   And the name of that thing that gets ejected,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.600]   it's sort of like a little Hubble pod is how I imagine it,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.200]   from "Star Wars" or from any kind of "Space Odyssey" movie
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.280]   where something is ready to happen,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.120]   a little Hubble pod shoots out of the ship.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.680]   Well, that 23 pairs is now ejected from the egg,
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.400]   it's called the polar body, and that's going to degenerate.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.840]   It's going to go away.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.080]   And in doing so, take the egg cell, which was once diploid,
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.120]   it had 23 pairs of chromosomes and making it haploid.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.340]   And now what you've got in ideal circumstances
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.460]   is a beautifully pristine egg that was selected for
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.900]   and has 23 single strands of chromosomes,
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.640]   22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.500]   And that sex chromosome is going to be an X chromosome
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.860]   almost with certainty because female mother
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.560]   is creating that egg.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.940]   So then the egg that contains just the appropriate
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.840]   23 single stranded chromosomes
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.780]   is going to fuse with the wall of the ovary
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.180]   and that egg will be released
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.140]   and will travel into the fallopian tube.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.200]   Now we'll get back to that egg in a few moments,
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.600]   but that process, which represents the first half
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.140]   of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.600]   again, was triggered by FSH
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.920]   and to some extent luteinizing hormone,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.900]   but it is the ongoing maturation of that egg,
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.840]   which also causes the production of estrogen,
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.940]   which allows that whole process to occur.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.080]   And you could say, why?
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.920]   Well, the answer to the why
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.780]   is a very important biological principle
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.860]   that we are going to return to
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.280]   in a number of different contexts today,
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.140]   both as reference to female and male fertility.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.580]   And the principle is a so-called negative feedback.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.220]   So when estrogen is present
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.300]   at relatively low levels in females,
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.460]   in the ovary as it is during the development of these eggs,
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.140]   some of that estrogen of course is going to exit the ovary.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.380]   It's going to go into the bloodstream
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.820]   and it's going to travel back to the pituitary.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.220]   Now the pituitary can release things
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.880]   like follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.180]   But the way I'd like you to think about the pituitary
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.840]   for sake of feedback loops
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.980]   is that it's sort of like a thermometer
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.180]   that you would put into a pool,
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.540]   like a backyard pool that is attached to the heater.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.780]   And for instance,
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.460]   if you were to put a thermometer into a pool
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.900]   that you would like to keep at 70 degrees
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.700]   and the temperature of that pool is 60 degrees,
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.220]   well, then that thermometer ought to trigger
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.020]   some sort of mechanism where the pool would heat up
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.220]   until the temperature of the pool hit 70 degrees
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.300]   and then it should trigger that thermometer
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.940]   to turn off the heating system, okay?
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.580]   That's kind of a negative feedback system
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.740]   that would keep the temperature more or less correct.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.820]   That's a lot of the way that the system's related to estrogen
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.740]   and also testosterone and these different things
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.580]   like luteinizing hormone
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.060]   and follicle stimulating hormone work as well.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.360]   Typically, when the level of a hormone is too high,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.780]   then it shuts down the production of the hormones
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.800]   that would trigger further production of that hormone.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.620]   I know that's a mouthful, it's a lot to think about
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.460]   and some of you are probably thinking,
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.540]   well, I'm getting dizzy now with biology,
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.420]   but I promise you can understand this.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.340]   In females, when estrogen is relatively low,
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.020]   but not zero, but is relatively low
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.920]   during that first follicular half of the ovulatory cycle,
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.180]   it actually triggers negative feedback on LH and FSH
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.220]   so that not too much is produced.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.700]   But then just prior to ovulation,
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.060]   the levels of estrogen
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.620]   and the levels of some other hormones from those eggs,
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.400]   you have the eggs producing estrogen themselves,
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.560]   gets high enough that it actually triggers
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.640]   a positive feedback loop on the pituitary.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.740]   So the pituitary is essentially observing
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.280]   the amount of estrogen in the bloodstream
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.680]   produced by the ovary and the amount of estrogen
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.280]   towards the end of the second half of the menstrual cycle
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.080]   has increased and triggers a positive feedback loop.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.080]   It triggers the pituitary to release more FSH and LH
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.240]   and that helps trigger ovulation, okay?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.500]   That deployment or the release
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.160]   of that one mature proper selected egg
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.500]   that's haploid with the 23 individual pairs of chromosomes
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.740]   into the fallopian tube.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.260]   So let's just back up really quickly
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.740]   and just kind of summarize what's happened.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.600]   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.620]   triggers the release of follicle-stimulating hormone
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.900]   and luteinizing hormone.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.120]   That travels to the ovary,
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.220]   triggers the release of a subset of immature follicles
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.880]   with immature eggs.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.260]   Those immature follicles and immature eggs
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.780]   start to mature, start to grow
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.740]   because of the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.420]   The growth of those eggs themselves increases estrogen.
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.760]   As the estrogen starts to accumulate in the environment,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.080]   some of that travels back to the pituitary
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.640]   and when levels of estrogen arriving at the pituitary
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.740]   are relatively low, the pituitary says,
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.360]   "Oh, we don't need to release any more
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.220]   follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone."
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.680]   However, at some point, just prior to ovulation,
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.240]   enough estrogen has been produced
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.120]   by that one single selected mature egg
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.140]   and some of the other follicles around it
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.360]   that were maturing but then since died off,
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.340]   that the estrogen triggers a positive feedback loop.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.520]   The pituitary says, "Okay,"
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.620]   and releases more follicle-stimulating hormone
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.700]   and luteinizing hormone and bam,
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.520]   the egg, which has the proper genetic components,
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.400]   sets off out of the ovary and into the fallopian tube.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.880]   So-called ovulation has begun, okay?
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.660]   That itself, what I just described,
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.800]   constitutes the first half of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.320]   which we call the follicular phase
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.480]   and it's marked by the presence of FSH
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.840]   and some other things but we can really think about it
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.680]   as marked by FSH from the pituitary
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.880]   and by estrogen or estradiol made within the ovary.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.640]   Okay, then comes the second half
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.560]   of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.440]   which I personally think is one of the coolest mechanisms
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.220]   in all of biology, which is that,
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.300]   remember the follicle that housed that one egg
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.980]   that was the selected egg that became the mature egg?
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.760]   And that follicle, which no longer contains the egg
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.620]   because the egg took off and ovulated,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.820]   is called the corpus luteum
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.500]   and the corpus luteum starts making three hormones,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.900]   which include estradiol, a thing called inhibin,
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.220]   but the most important hormone,
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.720]   the one that you really need to know about,
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.620]   is that it starts producing very high levels of progesterone.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.820]   Progesterone levels start to increase
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.840]   about the time of ovulation,
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.600]   although just prior to ovulation
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:56.200]   and over the next second half of the ovulatory cycle,
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.640]   so about 14 days if it's a 28 day cycle,
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.660]   a little bit longer, a little bit shorter,
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.080]   depending on the length of the cycle,
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.000]   levels of progesterone in the second half
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   of the ovulatory cycle are going to increase by 1400 fold
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.920]   compared to what they were in the first half
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.760]   of the ovulatory cycle.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.240]   So again, if we were to characterize
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.480]   the menstrual ovulatory cycle in broad strokes,
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.260]   what we would say is that FSH and estrogen
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.400]   mark the initial part, the first half,
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.640]   so-called follicular phase,
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.940]   and that the estrogen and FSH set in motion ovulation
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.960]   and they prime the system
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.500]   for the production of a corpus luteum,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.580]   which produces progesterone,
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.700]   and the second half of all of this
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.000]   is called the luteal phase.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.140]   The second half of the ovulatory menstrual cycle
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.620]   is the luteal phase because of corpus luteum,
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.540]   this otherwise discarded tissue that produces progesterone.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.320]   What does progesterone do?
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.680]   Well, progesterone impacts the uterine lining,
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.740]   so-called endometrium, or the lining,
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.060]   the mucus lining of the uterus,
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.180]   where that egg that's ovulated
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.760]   is potentially going to implant if it's fertilized.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.280]   And so in a kind of perfect way,
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.440]   or I should say in a seemingly perfect way,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.980]   the egg is off on its way, it might get fertilized.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.860]   The remnants of the compartment that let go of that egg
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   produce a hormone that then prepares
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.200]   the endometrial lining of the uterus
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.280]   for the potential implantation of that egg.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.120]   It's basically making the bed for the fertilized egg
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.260]   to potentially embed in, to implant in,
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.680]   and then achieve all the nourishment that it needs
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.360]   to grow eventually into a healthy embryo and child.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.200]   Just an amazing set of biological mechanisms
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.840]   if you ask me, because what you're observing here
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.320]   is an incredible economy of function,
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.520]   whereby the same cellular components
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.340]   that are producing the egg,
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.600]   well, some of them are being discarded,
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.200]   but they're not being discarded without purpose.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.440]   They're being discarded in a way that triggers
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.000]   the onset of hormonal expression
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.840]   that then prepares the fertilized egg
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.920]   to be in an enriched environment in which it can thrive.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.680]   Now, I realize that was a lot of detail,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.560]   but we have a couple of key themes.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.520]   We've got the hypothalamus, GnRH.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.240]   We've got the pituitary with LH and FSH,
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.480]   and those hormones travel to the ovary.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.080]   The ovary has eggs in a vault,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.920]   basically immature eggs in a vault.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.000]   Some of those are activated by the presence
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.280]   of FSH and LH each month,
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.080]   and one of those eggs will be selected
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.240]   and will ovulate.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.160]   The remnants of the follicle and egg that are not selected,
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.760]   the chromosomes that you don't need
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.920]   or disappear in the polar body,
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.000]   and the corpus luteum gives rise to progesterone
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.680]   and sets in motion the second half
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.920]   of the ovulatory menstrual cycle,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.360]   which is the luteal phase,
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.480]   which is essentially the potential for that fertilized egg
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.140]   to embed in a nice nourishing environment.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.280]   And of course, we should all be thinking
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.600]   if the egg is fertilized,
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.680]   and then it lays down in the nice comfy uterine lining
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.720]   that's been prepared by progesterone in the corpus luteum,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.940]   well, then everything's fine and good.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.880]   But what if fertilization doesn't occur?
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.960]   Well, we all know what happens
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.080]   if fertilization doesn't occur.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.000]   If fertilization does not occur for whatever reason,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.880]   that uterine lining is going to shed,
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.920]   and that's actually what's referred to as the period.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.160]   It's the actual removal or the departure, rather,
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:24.080]   of the thickened endometrium lining of the uterus
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.100]   when fertilization has not occurred.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.920]   And of course, if that happens,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.440]   we need another ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.280]   So how does that happen?
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.800]   Well, the hormone inhibin is also made
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.480]   by the corpus luteum and doesn't go quite as high
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.280]   as the hormone progesterone,
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.860]   but it kind of tracks that increase in progesterone
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.960]   that occurs in the second half of the ovulatory cycle.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   But then if fertilization does not occur,
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.440]   inhibin levels start to drop.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.960]   And what I haven't told you is what inhibin does.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.800]   Inhibin, in concert with other hormones like estrogen,
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.600]   feed back to the hypothalamus
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.400]   and prevent the further release
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.880]   of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:09.920]   If you have an egg that gets fertilized and can implant,
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.380]   well, then you don't want more eggs to mature.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.660]   You want to hold onto the ones in the vault.
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.700]   You don't want them to mature.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.100]   And hormones like inhibin and, again,
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.140]   working with other hormones are going to prevent
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.600]   the secretion of things like FSH and LH.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.800]   Now, typically, people are not getting pregnant every month.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.560]   In fact, that's not possible.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.240]   And part of the reason it's not possible
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.600]   is that if the fertilized egg implants,
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.080]   there are a number of different hormone cascades
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.080]   that shut down the production of things like GnRH, FSH,
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:42.720]   and LH in ways that prevent further maturation of follicles
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.080]   in a follicular phase.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.120]   But in the instance where fertilization does occur
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.260]   and menstruation occurs,
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.040]   and I should mention that the duration of menstruation,
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:52.880]   the actual bleeding,
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.860]   typically is anywhere from one to five days.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.920]   The "heaviness," the lightness or heaviness of that bleeding
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.080]   will depend on, you guessed it,
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.100]   the amount of progesterone
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.940]   that is secreted from the corpus luteum.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.320]   That's one of the key players there.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.580]   And if menstruation occurs,
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.600]   well, then inhibin levels also drop,
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.120]   progesterone levels also drop.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.640]   And when that occurs, there's a positive feedback signal
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.080]   up at the level of the pituitary.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.240]   The pituitary literally can register
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.960]   how much inhibin and progesterone and estrogen
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.640]   is present in the bloodstream.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.440]   And if those levels are sufficiently low,
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.400]   well, then GnRH gets secreted again,
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.040]   FSH gets secreted again, and LH gets secreted again.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.240]   And the first half, the follicular phase
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.480]   of the menstrual cycle initiates all over again.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.960]   It's hard to overstate how beautifully orchestrated
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.800]   this entire system is,
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.500]   the number of feedback loops and feedforward loops.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.360]   I think if you can just generally understand
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.000]   that the first half of the menstrual ovulatory cycle
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.920]   is marked by the maturation of the follicles and FSH,
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.720]   and that the second half is marked by the accumulation
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.820]   of progesterone and the thickening of the uterine lining
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.780]   should fertilization and implantation occur,
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.760]   I think that you will certainly understand
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   the female reproductive cycle better
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.560]   than most people out there.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.200]   It will also help you understand a number of things
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.720]   that are sometimes associated
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.200]   with the female reproductive cycle.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.560]   For instance, there are data showing that in many,
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.920]   not all, but in many women,
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.660]   in the four to five days prior to ovulation,
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.880]   there is a dramatic increase in libido.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.520]   That dramatic increase in libido
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.960]   is triggered by a number of things,
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.400]   but some of those things include the spike in FSH
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.520]   that occurs, the spike in LH that occurs,
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.660]   and some associated increases in androgens,
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.000]   things like DHEA and testosterone,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.680]   which just as in males can be related to libido,
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.360]   in females, trigger libido.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.880]   You can imagine why this would be an effective mechanism
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.240]   to have in place in females,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:58.560]   if the goal, as it were, certainly of the egg,
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.680]   perhaps not of the woman as a whole,
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.080]   but if the goal is to fertilize the egg.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:08.480]   So increases in libido just prior to the onset of ovulation.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.600]   There's also been a lot of discussion and interest,
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.740]   and frankly, data exploring the malaise that can occur
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:18.900]   at certain portions of the menstrual cycle.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.200]   And there's a lot of misconception about this.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.000]   A lot of people have focused on the malaise
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.800]   that can occur around the time of bleeding,
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.240]   but there are actually stronger data to support
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.140]   the fact that some, again, some, not all women,
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.800]   experience a kind of malaise,
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.480]   sometimes associated with anxiety, sometimes not,
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.640]   that's associated with the mid to second half
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   of the luteal phase of the ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:51.080]   And that, despite what people commonly think,
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.720]   is not associated with elevated levels of estrogen,
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.800]   it's actually associated with the depletion
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.280]   in estrogen levels that can occur during certain portions
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.980]   of that second half of the luteal phase
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.400]   of the menstrual cycle.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.760]   So again, this is highly variable.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.360]   For some people, they might not experience any malaise
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.500]   at any point during their menstrual cycle.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.880]   Other individuals also, for instance,
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.480]   might not experience any variation in their libido
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.120]   at any point during their menstrual cycle.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.240]   Again, highly variable,
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.020]   and yet there are some statistically significant trends
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.640]   that have been observed that track
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.380]   to very specific hormonal components
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.760]   within the menstrual cycle.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.740]   Again, this will all be very contextual.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.740]   And of course, this can play out
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:31.640]   in a number of different ways.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.160]   So for instance, some women experience very heightened levels
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.440]   of sensitivity to caffeine at certain portions
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.720]   of their menstrual cycle.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.200]   Other women experience more cramping than others,
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.000]   different portions of their menstrual cycle.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.280]   Tremendous variation from individual to individual.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.740]   One of the, I view it as an advantage,
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.800]   but one of the things that many females
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.920]   can really do and experience,
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.200]   because they have cycles that occur every month
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.280]   that are fairly dramatic in terms of their levels of hormone.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.700]   So for instance, a more than thousand-fold increase
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.640]   in progesterone during the luteal phase
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.740]   of the menstrual cycle.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.200]   And I should also mention a 200-fold increase in estrogen
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.160]   during the period just prior to ovulation.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.440]   That's why they always say estrogen primes progesterone.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.520]   That's what you learn in kind of basic endocrinology
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.740]   when you're learning the menstrual cycle.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.800]   Estrogen in the first half of the menstrual cycle
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.960]   primes progesterone in the second half
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.220]   of the ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:28.000]   Well, those estrogen increases just prior to ovulation
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.300]   are in part responsible for the increases in libido,
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.020]   but it's also the presence of increased androgen
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.080]   just prior to ovulation.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.300]   So there's a lot of complex interplay.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.220]   I think what we will do is we will reserve the discussion
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.680]   about libido per se and some of the other aspects
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.960]   related to sexual differentiation
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.040]   that we were talking about earlier for a future episode.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.680]   But hopefully now you have in mind
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.920]   what the ovulatory menstrual cycle is.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.400]   It is a signal from the brain, from the hypothalamus,
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.640]   which then triggers a signal from the pituitary,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.720]   an endocrine gland,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.120]   which then signals the release of hormones
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.140]   that travel to the ovary and that control two things,
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.680]   maturation of eggs
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.240]   and the identification of one egg in particular,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.600]   and then preparation of the milieu,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.820]   the environment in which that fertilized egg
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.200]   could potentially land and mature
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.160]   into a healthy embryo and child.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.080]   So if you have that framed up in your mind,
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.240]   and even if you just extracted maybe 10 to 15%
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.000]   of the hormones and different aspects that I described
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.080]   up until now,
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.880]   I would consider you far more knowledgeable
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.240]   about this entire process than 99% of people out there,
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   certainly not the OBGYNs and urologists,
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.440]   but the 99% of individuals out there.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.160]   It also frames up for us the second half of this whole story
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.000]   about fertility and fertilization,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.200]   which is the generation of sperm
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.580]   and how the sperm eventually arrive at the egg
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:56.020]   and how certain sperm are selected
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.800]   to potentially fertilize that egg,
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.160]   whereas others never really stand a chance.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.060]   So next, we're going to talk about sperm.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.720]   We're going to talk about what sperm are,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.800]   where they are generated and how they are generated
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.360]   and how they need to travel both within the male
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.800]   and within the female in order to allow fertilization
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.000]   to potentially occur.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.640]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.720]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.200]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.720]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.360]   to help you better understand your body
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.200]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.840]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.280]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.880]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.940]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.480]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.000]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.760]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.520]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.880]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.720]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.880]   you might want to take on
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.480]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.260]   hormones, lipids and other things
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.220]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:06.240]   to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.120]   and indeed optimal for you.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.500]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.040]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.760]   So we've covered the ovulatory cycle in females.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.180]   And I confess it was a lot of information
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.520]   with a lot of biological nomenclature,
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.080]   but I promise you that many of those same themes
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.060]   and indeed the same names and nomenclature
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.200]   will show up in the discussion that we're going to have now,
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.600]   which is about the generation of sperm.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.020]   Now, sperm are similar to eggs
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.880]   in the sense that they are part of the germline.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.720]   They're these protected cells,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.640]   protect in the sense that the activities of an individual
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.040]   are not going to change the genetic makeup of those cells.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.140]   Now, again, there are instances in which mutagens,
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.360]   such as chemicals could disrupt the genomes
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.960]   of the germ cells in males, just as it could in females.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.160]   But in general, the activities, the things that we do,
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.640]   the experiences we have,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.440]   doesn't tend to change the genome of those cells.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.460]   However, there are a lot of lifestyle factors,
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.320]   dos and don'ts, nutrition and supplements
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.800]   and prescription drugs, et cetera,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.940]   that can indeed modify the quality of the sperm.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.880]   And we'll talk about what sperm quality means.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.200]   But the point is that the sperm cell,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.000]   much like the egg cell, are both germline cells.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.560]   They're not like somatic cells, they are unique populations.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.440]   And let's just remember what the job of the sperm cell is.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:38.220]   The job of the sperm cell is to deliver the genetic material
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.460]   from the father and to do that
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.940]   in the form of a haploid cell.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.680]   So that means 23 chromosomes, 22 autosomes,
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.620]   one so-called sex chromosome.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.520]   Again, not sex the verb, at least not in this case.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.040]   Sex the verb is a discussion
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.680]   we're going to have in a few minutes.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.080]   But sex the noun, the sex chromosome
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.640]   can either be an X chromosome or a Y chromosome.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.600]   Okay, so 22 autosomes and then one sex chromosome
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.960]   is going to be contained within the sperm
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.480]   because it's a haploid cell, not a diploid cell.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.300]   Remember the egg was diploid, then it became haploid.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.100]   The sperm cells are cells that are created
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.420]   through the division of other cells.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.100]   But after that division occurs
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.820]   through a process called meiosis,
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:24.540]   the sperm cell is going to contain 23 chromosomes
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.620]   consisting of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.180]   And the sperm that manages to deposit its DNA contents
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.320]   into the egg to fertilize the egg
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:39.280]   will either have an X sex chromosome or a Y sex chromosome.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.000]   And the Y sex chromosome
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.800]   has a number of different genes on that chromosome
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.640]   that will suppress, for instance,
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.320]   the development of the female reproductive axis.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.360]   One good example would be
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.480]   the Mullerian-Inhibiting Hormone or MIH,
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.780]   the gene for Mullerian-Inhibiting Hormone,
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.240]   which is a hormone that prevents
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.200]   the formation of the Mullerian ducts,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.480]   which is part of the female reproductive structure.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.060]   Well, that gene controls the prevention
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.660]   of the development of the female genitalia
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.060]   and in doing so promotes
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.660]   the development of the male genitalia.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.980]   And there are other examples of genes
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.240]   that are on the Y chromosome
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.140]   that give you what we call male phenotype, right?
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.620]   You have genotype and phenotype.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.940]   By the way, in case you haven't heard this in a while
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.020]   from your high school biology,
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.740]   or if you never heard it, no big deal,
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.500]   karyotype is the complement of chromosome XX or XY.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.680]   And there are individuals out there that are XXY or XYY,
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.760]   a discussion for our episode on sex differentiation.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.840]   That's karyotype with a K.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.120]   Then there's genotype, which are the genes that you have.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.240]   And then there's phenotype spelled P-H,
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.560]   P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E, phenotype.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.400]   And the phenotype is how the genes,
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.960]   which then code for RNA, which code for protein,
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.680]   how those are expressed in terms of things like eye color.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.720]   So eye color is a phenotype, height is a phenotype,
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   hair color is a phenotype.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.960]   Okay, so you have karyotype, genotype, and phenotype.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.680]   Well, what we need to do is we need to bring together
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.640]   that sperm, which is haploid,
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.760]   it contains those 23 chromosomal strands
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.280]   with either an X or a Y.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.400]   Sex chromosome is the 23rd chromosome.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.920]   We need to get that cell to the egg.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.720]   And so when we talk about spermatogenesis,
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.200]   of course we're talking about the generation of sperm cells,
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.620]   but what we're really talking about
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.980]   is the generation of cells whose job
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:31.040]   is to deliver the genetic material from dad to the egg
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.040]   within the female in a way that increases the probability
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.780]   that not only will that egg be fertilized,
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.700]   but that it will progress in a healthy way
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.860]   with each set of chromosomes from mom and from dad,
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.600]   each set of 23 chromosomes that is,
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.320]   will progress in a healthy way,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.800]   will implant in a healthy way,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.040]   and will maintain and grow in a healthy way
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.840]   to a healthy embryo and child and eventually adult.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.240]   That's the job of the sperm, okay?
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.280]   So as we talk about spermatogenesis,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.120]   let's just remember that
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.720]   and why they're there in the first place.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.540]   Now, a few things about sperm that are interesting,
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.640]   besides the fact that they're haploid
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.320]   and besides the fact that, as you all know, they swim,
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.220]   they have a head and a tail.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.440]   They actually have a head, a mid-region, and a tail,
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.600]   and that mid-region turns out to be very important.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.060]   It's something we'll come back to again and again.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.460]   That mid-region is really key for the ability for sperm
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.440]   to engage in forward progression, to swim forward.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.020]   It involves the activity of mitochondria,
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.200]   which are involved in generation of ATP,
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.480]   which is involved in all aspects of energy in all cells.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.280]   But let's just remember that the sperm are swimming cells.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.240]   And in order to create a really good swimmer
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.560]   or set of swimmers, you need a couple of things.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.160]   First of all, within the testes is where the sperm develop.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.560]   And unlike in females and unlike in the ovary,
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.080]   there's no vault of sperm.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.640]   The sperm are continually being generated.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.080]   It takes about 60 days for sperm to be born
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.680]   from their parent cells,
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.600]   because cells actually give rise to other cells,
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.520]   that's the way it works,
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.440]   to be born from their parent cells and then mature
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.740]   to the point where they can be a really good swimmer.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.560]   Now, that doesn't mean that a bunch of sperm
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.840]   are made on day one, and then 60 days later,
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.360]   all those sperm are deployed in the form of ejaculate,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.020]   and then the cycle starts over again.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:21.860]   So it's a little different
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.760]   than the ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   Rather at any given point in time,
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.240]   like right now, if you have testes,
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.680]   you have some sperm in your testes that are immature
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.400]   and cannot swim, cannot deliver those contents
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.920]   to those genetic contents rather to the female egg,
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.460]   and you have some sperm that are mature,
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.840]   and you very likely have some sperm that are so mature
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.160]   that they are dying off or that they're dead.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.720]   Almost certainly also, regardless of your age,
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.440]   you have some sperm that are healthier than others,
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.080]   are better swimmers than others.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.160]   This is just the way the system works.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.440]   Now, the process of spermatogenesis
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.460]   involves a couple of things,
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.700]   but a lot of the players are the same as the process
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.980]   of developing the so-called oocyte, the immature egg.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.800]   We've got GnRH from the hypothalamus.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.640]   That's going to be a player.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.880]   We have FSH, follicle stimulating hormone,
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.780]   although the name's a little bit of a misnomer
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.360]   in the context of spermatogenesis,
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.380]   because in the context of spermatogenesis,
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.700]   there is no follicle.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.540]   What we're really talking about as FSH for stimulating
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.180]   the maturation of the sperm cell,
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.480]   so not egg follicle, but sperm cell,
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   but we still have GnRH, FSH, LH,
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.580]   and rather than the ovary being the target
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.500]   of those hormones, it's going to be the testes.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.780]   So most everybody should know that the testes
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.780]   and the ovaries are the so-called gonads.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.180]   The testes, of course, reside outside of the body.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.740]   There are instances where the testes fail to descend
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.700]   during development.
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.020]   Certainly if the testes don't descend on time,
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.180]   that's something that doctors need to be made aware of,
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.980]   the pediatricians be made aware of,
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.960]   because that can prevent fertility.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.860]   Why would that be?
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.700]   Well, it turns out that the testes reside outside the body
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.540]   in the scrotum because the temperature conditions
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.180]   under which spermatogenesis can occur
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.500]   and under which healthy sperm can be maintained
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:19.500]   are very restricted and is approximately two degrees cooler
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.820]   than the rest of the body.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.380]   This is very important.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.340]   I think this is something that used to be discussed
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:29.000]   a lot more, but isn't discussed so much these days,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.580]   but keeping the testes cool enough
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.980]   doesn't necessarily mean keeping them cold,
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:35.260]   although there is a place for using cold exposure,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:38.540]   deliberate cold exposure, to improve sperm quality
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.820]   and number and perhaps even testosterone levels.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.300]   We'll talk about that a little bit later,
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.540]   but keeping the testes about two degrees cooler
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.200]   than the rest of the body is absolutely key.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.940]   If sperm get too hot, they die.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.540]   And if spermatocytes, the cells that give rise to sperm,
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.500]   get too warm, well then oftentimes the sperm that develop
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.100]   are not healthy, not healthy in a number of ways.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.820]   Either they can't engage in fast forward progression
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:08.540]   and that is swimming, or they will lack the ability
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.460]   to deposit their DNA contents within the egg.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.060]   So again, whatever is contained in the ejaculate
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.300]   is going to be a mixture of different sperm qualities
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.600]   and sperm of different ages will impact the quality,
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.600]   but also the temperature under which those sperm developed
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.800]   is going to impact their quality.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.440]   And so we're going to get into tools a little bit later,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.540]   as I mentioned, but just to give you a simple takeaway,
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:36.040]   if you are hoping to conceive in the next 90 days,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.200]   the spermatogenesis cycle takes 60 days,
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.040]   but then the sperm actually have to migrate
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.380]   from the testicle into the so-called epididymis,
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.360]   which is a related structure,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.160]   and then into the vas deferens and then into the urethra
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.980]   where it can be part of the ejaculate.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.180]   In order for sperm to do all that properly,
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.960]   undergo that maturation and then exit in ejaculate
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.660]   in a way that's healthy or that the sperm is healthy,
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:02.360]   if you plan to conceive children
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.320]   or to try and conceive children in the next 90 days,
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.980]   you definitely want to avoid exposing your testicles,
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.040]   that is your scrotum, to elevated temperatures.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.220]   So that means definitely avoiding hot tubs,
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.640]   definitely avoiding hot baths.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.840]   Now, a brief hot bath or hot tub or hot shower
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.040]   isn't going to be a problem,
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.640]   although if you're really interested in conceiving,
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.420]   I would avoid hot tubs and hot baths as much as possible,
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.880]   hot showers are probably fine.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.080]   But if you're going to go into a sauna, for instance,
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.600]   you might want to rethink that decision,
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.640]   and if you do decide to,
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.980]   you almost certainly would want to bring a cold pack in
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.120]   that you could hopefully put some material
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.220]   between the cold pack and the scrotum
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.860]   so you don't get a cold burn, but put something there,
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   but keep the scrotal tissue cool, keep it cold to cool,
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.240]   because heat exposure can really mutate
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.220]   and disrupt the developing sperm and it can kill sperm.
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:00.860]   And so again, that would be for an entire 90 days
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.540]   leading up to your attempts to conceive.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.940]   Again, we'll get into more tools later,
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.600]   but a number of people also have probably heard
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.140]   of the boxers versus briefs controversy, I guess it is,
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.840]   or whether or not people call it going commando
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.360]   with no underwear of any kind, boxers, briefs,
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.040]   or otherwise, rather.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.000]   Turns out that the data on that point to the fact
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.840]   that there isn't really a big difference
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.000]   in terms of sperm quality if people wear boxers or briefs
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.260]   or don't wear anything under their jeans or shorts at all.
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:37.280]   The scrotum has the ability to move the testicles
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.740]   far enough away from the body
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.360]   in order to achieve lower temperatures.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.160]   If it needs to, it achieves that through a muscle
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.660]   called the cremaster muscle,
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.480]   which is a really interesting muscle, believe it or not.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.400]   I was reading up on the biology of the cremaster muscle,
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.600]   something I never thought I'd spend too much time on,
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.920]   but that I ended up spending far too much time
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.520]   reading up about, and it's really fascinating.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.860]   What you have is a muscle that has a smooth muscle tissue,
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.560]   unlike skeletal muscle, which is striated muscle,
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.000]   that is temperature dependent.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.040]   So it has certain nerve endings
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.080]   and it has certain receptors on it
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.320]   that allow it to respond to local temperature
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.860]   and then to relax in order to essentially let the testicles
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.440]   to descend further from the body
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.900]   or to contract and bring the testicles closer to the body
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.680]   in order to try and maintain the optimal temperature range.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.360]   And it turns out the cremaster muscle can achieve that
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.320]   whether or not people are wearing boxers or briefs,
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.400]   although it stands to reason that any kind of,
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.320]   there's no other name for it, undergarments,
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.600]   I don't know why that word just seems kind of antiquated,
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.320]   but undergarment that allows some movement
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.340]   of the scrotum and the testicles
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.540]   should be sufficient to allow these temperature variations
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.080]   to occur and keep things in range.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.420]   That said, a little bit later,
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.720]   we'll go into some detail really,
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.460]   because it's important as to why, for instance,
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.220]   if you are somebody who has big thighs, believe it or not,
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.660]   that it actually can lower sperm count substantially,
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.620]   whether or not the big thighs occur
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.580]   because you're very muscular,
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.820]   the big thighs occur because you are overweight,
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.440]   it can increase the temperature.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440]   If you're sitting a lot,
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.080]   increases scrotal temperature for sure.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.200]   And there are some other things
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.840]   that can increase scrotal temperature,
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.440]   seat heaters in cars, for instance, terrible idea,
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440]   just terrible idea if you're hoping to conceive
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.340]   in the near future.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:19.960]   And again, hot tub, things of that sort.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.240]   Okay, so temperature modulation of spermatogenesis
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.540]   and sperm quality and function is key,
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.720]   that relates a little bit more to tools, but what happens?
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.160]   How does the actual sperm develop?
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.000]   Well, contained within the testicle, you have the cells,
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.760]   the so-called spermatogonia,
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.940]   which differentiate into so-called spermatocytes.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.320]   You don't have to remember all this.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.120]   And the spermatocytes undergo this process of meiosis.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.040]   Meiosis is a form of cell division,
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.120]   which reduces the chromosome number
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.040]   to those 23 individual strands as opposed to pairs, right?
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.460]   So it makes them haploid as opposed to diploid.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.000]   Very, very important for reasons
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.120]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.640]   And the meiosis process in these primordial sperm cells,
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.560]   these immature sperm cells is similar
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.080]   to the meiosis process that occurs in eggs
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.560]   when the chromosomes segregate
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.860]   in that involves these spindle-like structures
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:11.700]   within the cell.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:12.960]   Now, why do I keep bringing up the spindles?
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.900]   Well, it turns out that the function of the spindle
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.400]   in the egg and the sperm is heavily dependent
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.200]   on mitochondrial function.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.760]   And later, when we get into tools
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.400]   for improving egg and sperm quality,
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.720]   you're going to hear about a lot of tools
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.160]   for improving mitochondria.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.440]   And it's not just because the mitochondria are involved
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.280]   in energy demanding aspects of cell biology,
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.200]   but it's also because the mitochondria in this context
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.640]   are very, very important for the removal of,
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.920]   or the separation of one set of chromosomes
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.720]   to give you these two sets of haploid cells,
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.400]   the egg and the sperm.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.280]   And this is so important
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.660]   because many failures at fertilization,
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.040]   many failures at implantation,
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.560]   many, many miscarriages and many birth defects
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.460]   that do survive after birth that are very detrimental,
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.880]   such as trisomies and things like that occur
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.640]   because the spindles don't effectively
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.080]   pull apart the chromosomes in typically the egg,
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.360]   but it can also occur in the sperm.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.880]   Okay, so the spindles and the fact that mitochondria
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.920]   are rich on the spindle are very important
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.440]   for generating these haploid sperm,
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.600]   again, 23 individual strands of chromosomes,
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.880]   that's occurring inside of the testes, okay?
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.960]   So there's not as much long distance migration
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.980]   of the spermatocytes and the sperm cells
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.220]   as there is the egg, just when you think about
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:33.900]   the overall architecture of the uterus
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.500]   and the fallopian tubes compared to the testicles,
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.560]   but there's still a lot of movement.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.920]   So within the testicle,
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.440]   if you were to look at the testicle in cross-section,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.640]   and I prefer to call it that
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.060]   rather than cut the testicle in half,
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.140]   anytime you talk about anatomy,
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.380]   you actually talk about slicing things,
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:48.480]   that's what you would do with a cadaver is what I teach,
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.600]   and we do in my laboratory
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.180]   and frankly in biological laboratories all over the place.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.020]   But when you talk about it,
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:58.140]   you talk about if you were to take a visual cross-section
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.060]   through the testicle,
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.260]   what you would find is that
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.900]   there are a lot of different little tubes,
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:06.900]   a lot of ducts, D-U-C-T-S, ducts, those are pathways.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.620]   And the main ducts that are important for this discussion
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.140]   are called the seminiferous tubules, okay?
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.460]   So it's a mesh-like or network structure of tubes
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.540]   in the testicle, and the immature sperm
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:24.680]   sit on a little compartment along the edge of those tubes,
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.900]   and as they mature,
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.740]   they move towards the center of those tubes,
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.500]   and then when they are mature enough,
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:33.340]   those sperm cells actually drop into the hollow of the tube
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:35.880]   and then can travel through those tubes
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.120]   to a structure that's along the side of the testicle
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.220]   called the epididymis.
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:45.180]   The epididymis, again, is a series of ducts,
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.820]   and then the epididymis
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.300]   converges with something called the vas deferens, okay?
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.740]   I think in high school, we all remember this
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.540]   by thinking about it's the vas deferens.
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.060]   I don't know who came up with that.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.100]   Maybe, I think it was a young girl sitting to the left of me
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.600]   that was like, "Oh, it's like the vas deferens."
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.440]   I never forgot that.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   I don't know, maybe it was the topic matter,
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.140]   maybe it was her, maybe it was some combination of the two,
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:06.780]   but in any case, the sperm go from the seminiferous tubules
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.140]   to the epididymis and then to the vas deferens
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.780]   and then are contained in the ejaculate
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.660]   along with seminal fluid.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:18.740]   Now, the seminal fluid is the carrier fluid
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.680]   for the sperm themselves.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.980]   This is important because it turns out
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.300]   that a lot of the things that can both negatively
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.400]   or positively impact the quality of the sperm
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.260]   relates not just to the sperm cells themselves
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.440]   and the temperature of the environment
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.420]   that they were matured in,
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.420]   but also to the semen quality.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:42.700]   For instance, if you are a heavy drinker,
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.840]   if you are a smoker,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.660]   or if you are a regular user of cannabis,
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:50.520]   especially if you smoke cannabis or vape cannabis,
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.680]   you create a lot of reactive oxygen species
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:57.460]   that disrupt the chemistry of the seminal fluid,
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.020]   which disrupts the sperm cells.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.900]   So it's not a direct action always on the sperm cell itself,
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:02.740]   although it can be.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:07.480]   So for instance, in the form of smoked tobacco or cannabis,
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.180]   there are a lot of carcinogens and mutagens
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.480]   that actually mutate the DNA,
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.520]   can cause DNA fragmentation and debilitate sperm.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.620]   But there are also a lot of things
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.420]   created by smoking in particular,
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.940]   regardless of what's being smoked,
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.100]   that can create elevated reactive oxygen species
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.700]   and disrupt the seminal fluid
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.940]   that the sperm are contained in
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.280]   in the so-called ejaculate, the semen.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.020]   Now, this will also become a relevant conversation later
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.500]   when we briefly talk about vasectomies.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:42.500]   Vasectomies are literally a cutting of the vas deferens,
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.000]   which leads to a situation,
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.040]   provided the surgery was done correctly,
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.480]   where men can still achieve
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.000]   all the other aspects of intercourse.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.020]   They can still achieve erection.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.900]   They can still achieve orgasm.
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:57.220]   They can still ejaculate.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.300]   But when they ejaculate, the seminal fluid is released,
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.760]   but there are no sperm contained within the seminal fluid.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.720]   And it turns out that vasectomies
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.540]   are a very effective form of birth control.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.860]   And they always check to see if zero sperm
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.880]   and confirm that zero sperm
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.660]   are being released in the ejaculate.
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.200]   They are reversible.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.800]   That is, vasectomies are reversible, but not always.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.940]   There are a subset of cases where it's not reversible,
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.500]   in which case, if people still want to have children,
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.420]   you have to go in and actually surgically extract sperm
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.580]   from the testicles.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   But it's a process in which the vas deferens is altered
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.460]   or severed in a way that the sperm
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.120]   can't actually exit the testicle.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.660]   They can get into the epididymis usually,
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.260]   but not into the vas deferens and so on and so forth.
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.060]   So if you've ever wondered what a vasectomy is,
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.420]   that's what a vasectomy is.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:47.460]   And I mentioned vasectomy now
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.240]   because it illustrates the difference
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.940]   between the seminal fluid, the semen,
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.200]   and the sperm that the semen contain, okay?
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.940]   So 60 days to generate the sperm,
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:01.220]   another two weeks or so for the sperm to travel
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.480]   through the various ducts to the point
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.300]   where they can be contained in the ejaculate.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.900]   Let's talk about the sperm cells themselves.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:12.380]   The sperm cells, again, have these 23 pairs
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.860]   of single-strand chromosomes.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.080]   They're haploid, they have either an X or a Y.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.280]   Sex chromosome is the 23rd so-called sex chromosome.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.060]   And as we all know, they have a head.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:24.140]   The head tends to be oval in most cases.
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:27.660]   The head contains very important enzymes and proteins
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:30.900]   that are designed to fuse with the much larger egg
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.700]   and to actually take the membrane of the sperm cell
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:38.700]   and combine to actually mesh with the egg cell's membrane
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:44.580]   and then deliver the genetic contents to the egg cell,
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.880]   in other words, to fertilize the egg cell.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.540]   Now just behind the head is a region called the mid-region.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:54.340]   That mid-region is a slightly thickened region.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.180]   And here, of course,
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:57.640]   I'm talking about healthy sperm cell morphology.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.360]   Morphology simply means shape.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.760]   A mid-region, that mid-region has a bunch of things
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.560]   related to cell motility
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.520]   and to the forward progression of the cells.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.820]   First of all, it is chock-a-block full of mitochondria.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.500]   In fact, if you were to look just behind the head
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.900]   of the sperm, what you'd see is that
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.980]   it is completely surrounded by mitochondria.
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.380]   There are mitochondria elsewhere in the cell,
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.660]   but most of them are contained
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.900]   in this mid-region compartment
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.060]   just behind the head of the sperm.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:29.700]   And that thick region is where the tail movement
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:34.700]   of the sperm, the flagellation back and forth
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.960]   is actually generated from.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.140]   Much like if you were to hold a rope,
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.860]   like a battle rope in the gym
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.040]   and you were to whip the battle rope,
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.020]   the whip at the one end of the rope
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.440]   is what allows for the,
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.620]   let's just call it what it is,
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.700]   the curves in the rope, the oscillations,
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.460]   the rising and falling of the rope
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.700]   all the way out to the end, right?
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:02.500]   It is the force of the whip right at that end
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.740]   that you're, with the battle rope,
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.300]   you're doing with your hand and then with the sperm
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.420]   that is occurring just behind the head of the sperm
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.620]   that is actually going to dictate how fast
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.160]   and how well that sperm can swim.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.780]   And indeed the sperm has to swim very far.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:17.620]   How far?
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.420]   Well, on a relative scale,
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.080]   and again, these are estimations
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.780]   because they're going to be, how should we say?
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.880]   There will be differences in the distance
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.880]   from the head of the penis
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.960]   and where the ejaculation occurs to the cervix
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.220]   depending on the relative size of the vaginal canal
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.220]   and the penis that delivers the ejaculate
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.340]   to the vaginal canal.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:44.260]   But once the sperm arrive at the cervix, okay,
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:46.580]   which is at the back of the vaginal canal,
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.440]   just at the opening to the uterus,
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.340]   once the sperm arrive there,
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.540]   the distance from the cervix to the egg,
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.980]   of course will vary depending on where that egg is
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:01.020]   in its ovulatory trajectory, its pathway,
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:04.500]   but it is a kin based, if you scale for size,
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.780]   to the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco,
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:10.580]   which is many, many hundreds of miles.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.660]   So those sperm have to swim very far.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.860]   Now, of course, if the sperm are delivered
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.620]   in the vaginal canal somewhat further away,
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.100]   they will have further to go.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.100]   If they're delivered right at the cervical opening,
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.900]   they will have less far to go.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.600]   The very effective swimming sperm swim very fast.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.660]   So they are able to accomplish that distance
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.860]   in just a few days.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.460]   And this relates to a discussion
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.140]   that we will get into in a lot more detail later
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:39.820]   as to how often couples should have intercourse
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.440]   if they're trying to conceive.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.200]   Many people might think, well, it's every day.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.220]   However, the more frequent the ejaculation,
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:49.160]   the lower the concentration of sperm in each ejaculate.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.060]   So this is not a discussion about how often
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.540]   to have intercourse, depending to your preferences
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.720]   for pleasure or bonding or whatever reason,
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.560]   this is a discussion about how often to have intercourse
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.340]   in order to optimize the probability
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.860]   of fertilization of the egg.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.380]   There's some general rules that of course come to mind,
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:09.020]   which is ejaculations close to ovulation,
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:12.860]   both before, during, or sometimes after
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.740]   are obviously advantageous.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.540]   But you will also hear OBGYNs and urologists
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.420]   suggesting intercourse every other day
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.940]   leading up to the day of ovulation,
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:26.600]   starting about three to four days out
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.400]   from the day of ovulation.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.120]   So we got a little bit sidetracked,
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.140]   albeit I think appropriately so,
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.720]   and focusing on fertilization.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.920]   But what we were talking about
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.660]   right up until the point of that
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:39.700]   is the anatomy of the sperm itself,
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.320]   which is the head, the mid region
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.240]   that contains all those mitochondria, and then the tail.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.340]   Now, what we haven't discussed
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.380]   is the actual generation of the sperm.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.420]   So if you're a male or if you're a female,
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:53.740]   I think it's really important to understand
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.520]   how spermatogenesis works.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.120]   Spermatogenesis works in much in the same way
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.620]   that the generation and maturation of eggs work.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:04.840]   Although, as I mentioned before,
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.860]   it's going to occur ongoing
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:11.680]   throughout the cycle of the male's life after puberty.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.840]   We already talked about puberty,
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.100]   and I'll just cover this in two or three sentences
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.680]   as it relates to males.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.920]   And it's essentially the same thing.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.300]   The hypothalamus up until the point of puberty
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.200]   is providing suppression of the release of gonadotropin
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.260]   releasing hormone.
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.340]   Then some biological clock,
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:34.440]   which is still not clearly understood,
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.060]   it's probably not leptin coming from body fat.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.580]   Again, unlike in the female,
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.640]   it's probably not leptin coming from body fat,
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.900]   but some other signal arrives to the hypothalamus,
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:45.960]   removes that inhibition,
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.380]   and GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.500]   is now released onto the pituitary.
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.820]   A bunch of hormones are deployed from the pituitary.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.980]   As a consequence, the two most important ones
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.660]   for the context of this discussion
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:00.260]   are follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.540]   Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:05.000]   travel to the testes,
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.600]   and they're going to do two main things.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:10.200]   One, they're going to trigger the production of testosterone,
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.340]   and they're going to trigger the production
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.760]   of the sperm themselves.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.340]   They're going to set in motion
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.420]   for essentially the rest of the life of the male,
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.500]   the production of sperm.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.660]   They're going to initiate the spermatogenesis cycle,
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.880]   and that cycle is going to be ongoing at various stages
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.960]   for different sperm for the rest of the man's life.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.740]   This is very different than the triggering
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:36.260]   of development of oocytes in eggs in females,
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:38.220]   where there's an existing vault,
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.460]   that vault can be depleted to the point of zero,
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.460]   where it can't occur again.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.860]   Men can generate sperm their entire lifetime.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.860]   Of course, there's a diminishment of sperm production
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:50.260]   in very, very late age, say '80s and '90s or '00s,
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:52.260]   but believe it or not, there's still sperm being produced.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:55.140]   The quality of those sperm is another question.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:57.300]   So everything we're going to talk about now
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.880]   is essentially puberty onward, okay?
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.320]   Prior to that, testicles are present,
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.620]   but they're not generating sperm.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.320]   Ejaculation is impossible, or if it is possible,
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.720]   it's very unlikely and unusual,
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.520]   and it's not going to contain sperm.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:17.340]   Everything we're going to talk about now is puberty forward.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:20.420]   Okay, so puberty onward to the rest of life.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:24.180]   And luteinizing hormones secreted from the pituitary
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.860]   acts on the testes and on a very specific cell type
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.580]   in the testes called the Leydig cells, or Leydig cells,
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:33.060]   L-E-Y-D-I-G, the Leydig cells.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.140]   The Leydig cells of the testes
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:36.820]   are what produce testosterone.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:41.440]   Testosterone is going to have two major effects,
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.940]   and here I mean really major,
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.920]   because it has many, many hundreds of effects
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.020]   on different tissues of the body.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:48.540]   In fact, that's the definition of a hormone, really.
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:51.040]   It's a substance that acts in an endocrine fashion.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.420]   It can act on the very tissue that generated it.
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.700]   So for instance, testosterone made by the Leydig cells
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.260]   within the testes will act on the testes,
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.220]   as we'll talk about in a moment,
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.840]   but it can also act on other tissues.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.820]   It can act on the pharynx and larynx
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.420]   and deepen the voice as it does during puberty.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.900]   It can act on the hair follicles and generate facial hair.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:10.900]   It can act on the musculature and generate protein synthesis
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.460]   and development of muscle, bone, et cetera.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.100]   Okay, all the things we associate with puberty
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.700]   and with testosterone typically.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:20.260]   Restricting the conversation to the effects of testosterone
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:23.320]   on the testicle itself and on spermatogenesis,
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.780]   the Leydig cells make testosterone
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.980]   and keep in mind that some of that testosterone
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.540]   will travel elsewhere in the body and do its thing
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.300]   for gene expression and the more acute effects
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.720]   of testosterone on the brain included.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.900]   But the testosterone within the testes
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.660]   is at extremely high concentration.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.980]   In fact, the concentration of intratesticular testosterone
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.140]   is at least a hundred times higher
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.660]   than the concentration of testosterone
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:49.660]   anywhere else in the body,
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.980]   even though it's being secreted into the rest of the body.
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:54.740]   And that's because there are a number of different
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.680]   so-called binding proteins and enzymes
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.460]   that sequester the testosterone within the testes.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.260]   So the Leydig cells are making testosterone.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:04.780]   A lot of that testosterone is acting on
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.740]   and is restricted to the testes.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.100]   And that turns out to be very important
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.740]   because testosterone within the testes
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:16.540]   acts in concert with a different biological program
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:19.360]   that starts with FSH, follicle stimulating hormone,
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.520]   that also travels to the testes
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.780]   and acts on a very specific set of cells
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:26.580]   that are called supporting cells
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:29.960]   or more specifically the Sertoli cells.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.400]   The Sertoli cells are the cells that generate
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.420]   something called ABP or androgen binding protein.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:39.060]   And it is the combination of testosterone
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:43.140]   from the Leydig cells and ABP from the Sertoli cells
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.760]   that is necessary for spermatogenesis.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.320]   It's necessary for those spermatocytes
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.680]   to become what will eventually be healthy,
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.340]   mature sperm that have really nice shaped oval heads,
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:57.860]   have a mid-region chock-a-block through mitochondria
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.280]   and can generate a fast whipping motion of the tail
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.140]   to swim from the cervix or up the vagina to the cervix
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:07.860]   and from the cervix to the egg to fertilize the egg.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.420]   So it's really a basic set of chemical players
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:11.780]   that are involved here.
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.860]   And so basic in fact, that if you were to disrupt
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:16.420]   any one of these chemical players,
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.240]   either the luteinizing hormone, the FSH,
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.660]   the testosterone for the Leydig cells
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.060]   or androgen binding protein,
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:27.580]   you would observe pretty marked disruption
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:31.080]   in spermatogenesis or the elimination of sperm entirely.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.740]   We'll get into a few deficits in sperm development
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:36.140]   and sperm number and sperm function a little bit later,
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:38.580]   but just keep in mind where I should say,
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.220]   maybe sit back and just appreciate
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:43.780]   that the exact same players generate from the hypothalamus,
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:47.340]   which causes luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulated
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.820]   hormone release from the pituitary,
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.120]   which travels to the gonad,
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.960]   which in this case is the testicle,
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.600]   which triggers the release of testosterone from Leydig cells,
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.900]   which triggers the action of the supporting cells,
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.520]   the sertoli cells, which make androgen binding protein,
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.000]   testosterone and androgen binding protein combine
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.760]   and create a chemical and actually a structural milieu
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.300]   in which those little spermatocytes can go from the walls,
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.960]   from literally the walls of the tubes
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.640]   of the seminiferous tubules,
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.780]   can mature into healthy, well-developed sperm
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:23.020]   and can hop into those ducts, those little tubes,
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.260]   and then head off to the epididymis where they will reside.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.020]   The epididymis is the tissue nearby the testicle
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.980]   or surrounding one portion of the testicle,
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.040]   and then eventually fuse with the vas deferens,
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.780]   can combine with or be contained with rather
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:40.180]   the seminal fluid, and then can be ejaculated
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:42.380]   via the urethra into the female
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:44.920]   where then they can swim very quickly,
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.900]   effectively the distance for them anyway,
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.880]   from Los Angeles to San Francisco
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.580]   over the course of a very short period of time
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.820]   and fertilize the egg.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.700]   So that's the process of spermatogenesis,
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:58.840]   the maturation of sperm, which is ongoing
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.840]   throughout the lifespan from puberty onward.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.680]   And in doing so,
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.540]   we talked about some of the hormonal elements
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:07.580]   coming from the hypothalamus and coming from the pituitary
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.420]   and within the testes themselves,
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.420]   the Leydig cells, which produce testosterone,
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.820]   the sertoli cells, which are the support cells
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:16.420]   that allow spermatogenesis to occur.
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:20.520]   With that in mind, next I'd like to think about
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.680]   what's actually contained in the ejaculate
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.760]   in terms of numbers of sperm,
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.340]   and what's really being selected for
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.280]   in terms of the sperm that actually successfully
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.480]   fertilizes the egg,
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.360]   and what sorts of elements come into play
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.560]   in dictating whether or not fertilization
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.720]   will or won't occur.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.900]   And the major themes that we're going to discuss
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.500]   are frequency of ejaculation,
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.600]   but really that's just kind of a proxy
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.040]   for talking about maximizing sperm concentration
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.920]   and quality of sperm arriving at the egg, right?
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.200]   Because remember, ovulation and the menstrual cycle
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.700]   are really about creating the opportunity for fertilization.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:37:00.480]   And we are also going to talk about how the vaginal duct,
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.000]   the vagina, and the milieu around the cervix,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.520]   and some other elements within the female herself
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.140]   contribute to and support the sperm
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.540]   in their journey to the egg
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.820]   and in the likelihood that they will fertilize the egg.
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.400]   So really what we need to talk about first is sperm quality.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.780]   And we should also probably talk about ejaculate quality,
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:24.900]   because as odd as that theme might seem,
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.760]   really the ejaculate quality,
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.400]   which has a number of different parameters,
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.580]   including the number of mature sperm
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.480]   that are not so mature that they're swimming slower or dead,
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.760]   but also quality sperm that have, for instance, one tail,
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.140]   it's not entirely uncommon to see sperm with two tails,
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.140]   right, because they just didn't form properly,
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:45.740]   or sperm that are not moving very much.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:48.600]   In fact, sperm motility is scored along a scale
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.160]   of zero, one, two, or three,
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.840]   three being the best for fast-forward progressing,
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.600]   zero is not moving at all.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.620]   One, they're actually called twitchers, right?
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.560]   Twitchers are sperm that sort of just twitch in place,
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.000]   but don't undergo forward progression.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.240]   Two is somewhere in between one and three,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.220]   not surprisingly.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:09.720]   Different clinics, different OB/GYNs,
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.080]   different urologists will throw out different numbers,
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:16.960]   but in general, it is hoped that more than 50%
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.280]   of the sperm should be motile in some way or another,
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.740]   so not scoring a zero, but a one, a two, or ideally a three.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:26.940]   The concentration of sperm, of course,
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:29.440]   if it's higher within the ejaculate,
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.980]   the total number of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate,
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:35.380]   if that's higher, then there's a higher probability
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:38.440]   that one of those sperm will fertilize the egg.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.640]   One thing I didn't mention before when discussing
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.200]   the production of eggs in ovulation,
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.120]   and I probably should have, so I will now,
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.820]   is that most often only one ovary
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.680]   gives rise to an ovulating egg, right?
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.680]   It happens, but it's somewhat rare for two mature eggs,
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.440]   one from each ovary to be deployed
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.080]   during a single ovulation.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.520]   There's a name for that when it occurs
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.160]   and both are fertilized, it's called fraternal twins.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.380]   If a single egg, that of course comes from a single ovary,
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.660]   is fertilized and the egg splits,
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:16.780]   and that's something that happens further along the process
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:19.920]   of fertilization and differentiation of the embryo,
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.220]   well, then what you get are identical twins, okay?
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:26.500]   There are other instances that are quite uncommon
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.740]   in which you can get fraternal twins
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:28.740]   through other circumstances,
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.340]   but in general, that's the way it works.
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:33.180]   But essentially what happens is one egg from one ovary,
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.800]   that's the most common occurrence.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.860]   The sperm, once ejaculated into the vaginal duct,
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:42.540]   are going to pass through the cervix
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.680]   and then are going to swim toward the egg.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:47.900]   The egg could be at varying locations
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.820]   along the female reproductive axis.
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:52.820]   Now, this is actually a very important thing
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.340]   and actually gets right down to the safety
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:58.480]   of both the potentially developing embryo and the mother.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.160]   There is something referred to as ectopic pregnancy,
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.280]   and that's when the pregnancy actually occurs
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.980]   within the fallopian tubes.
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.300]   So the precise location in which fertilization
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:11.420]   between the sperm and the egg occurs can vary somewhat,
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:15.260]   but ideally the fertilized egg implants into the endometrium
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.500]   or the endometrial lining of the uterus
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.500]   and develops there as opposed to within the fallopian tubes,
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.340]   which is so-called ectopic pregnancy.
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:26.740]   Now, where the sperm and the egg meat exactly can vary,
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:28.100]   as I mentioned before,
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.820]   but in general, the faster swimming sperm
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:35.480]   and the more far along the ovulatory trajectory the egg are,
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.080]   the higher the probability of a successful fertilization
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.260]   because of the proximity
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.420]   to the implantation zone of the uterus.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.780]   So basically it's all a probabilities game.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:45.360]   It's a probabilities game related
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.640]   to the number of sperm cells that encounter the egg
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.580]   and where the egg is in terms of its ovulatory cycle
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:55.320]   and also its position where it is in the ovulatory cycle.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:59.360]   The sperm parameters, I should say the semen parameters
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:03.240]   and ejaculate parameters that most clinicians want to see
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.660]   if you were to give a sperm sample would be somewhere
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:11.660]   in excess of 15 million sperm per milliliter of ejaculate.
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:15.080]   Now there's a lot of discussion nowadays,
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.140]   it seems to be a very popular news theme
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:20.240]   to talk about diminishing sperm counts.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.000]   You know, the idea that a hundred years ago
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.820]   or maybe even 35 years ago,
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.560]   the typical male ejaculate contained
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.120]   a hundred million sperm per milliliter.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.000]   And nowadays it's down to 15 to 20 or 50.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.400]   And indeed sperm counts do seem to be declining
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.680]   and the exact reasons for that are not clear.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.520]   I confess I'm a little bit reluctant to talk about this
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.060]   because there have been a lot of back and forth discussions
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:45.200]   about the safety of EMFs of electromagnetic fields.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.800]   That's not exactly what we're talking about here
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.460]   but there are some excellent data contained
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.860]   in meta-analysis and reviews that I will provide links to
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:54.760]   and that we'll talk about in more detail in a minute
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.720]   that correlate the advent of smartphones
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:01.920]   and in particular carrying of smartphones in the pocket
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.260]   with diminishing sperm counts.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.840]   Although there are certain to be other factors
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.500]   that can explain diminishing sperm counts as well.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:12.600]   Dr. Shaina Swan, for instance, has done beautiful work
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.200]   describing how the phthalates and the BPAs
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.920]   and so-called endocrine disruptors might be disrupting
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.040]   some of the milieu of the seminiferous tubules.
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.640]   So this would be reductions in testosterone
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.900]   and or disruptions to the sertoli cells
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.640]   and androgen binding protein brought about
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.880]   by endocrine disruptors such as phthalates
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.760]   contained in pesticides and contained on printed receipts
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:33.720]   and things of that sort.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:37.060]   There are some data that that is negatively impacting
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.060]   sperm counts.
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:42.640]   How much so is still debatable.
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.320]   There are also quite good data pointing to the fact
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.820]   that both the heat related and the nonheat related impact
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:54.180]   of smartphones and laptops contained on the lap
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:57.180]   are impacting sperm counts and in a negative way.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.100]   Again, there's going to be tremendous variation
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.740]   in the concentration of sperm from one individual to the next
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:04.700]   it will vary according to age and a number of other factors
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.260]   that we'll talk about a little bit later.
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.400]   But in general, if somebody is wishing to conceive,
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.860]   then clinicians like to see a ejaculate volume
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:16.660]   of more than two milliliters.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:21.660]   So ejaculate volume can be anywhere from 1.5 to five
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:24.140]   milliliters, and that will strongly be determined
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:27.020]   by how frequent ejaculation is occurring.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.380]   There's a lot that goes into evaluating the quality
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:34.380]   of ejaculate and sperm, but basically these huge variations
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.980]   that are observed of anywhere from 15 million sperm
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:40.460]   per milliliter or in some males who are not producing sperm
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.340]   for whatever reason, we'll talk about those reasons
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.480]   in a little bit.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:47.540]   The as low as 5 million sperm per milliliter,
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:49.480]   all the way up to a hundred or maybe a 200 million
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.520]   sperm per milliliter, huge variation.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.080]   The cause of which is not always clear,
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.560]   but is certainly determined in part by the frequency
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:00.400]   of ejaculation.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.040]   So because there are so many variables impacting
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.840]   why one male versus another male or even the same male
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.680]   across the lifespan might have variations
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:12.360]   in his concentration of sperm within the ejaculate.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.640]   Let's talk for a second about frequency of ejaculation
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.080]   as it relates to the goal of fertility per se,
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.260]   'cause that's really what today's episode is all about.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.940]   So what I'd like to talk about next is how people can
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.080]   increase the probability of a successful fertilization
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.320]   focusing both on the components from the male side
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.560]   and from the female side.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.440]   And I'm mainly going to couch this discussion in the context
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:36.760]   of the so-called natural method of sexual intercourse
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.520]   and ejaculation in vivo, right, within the female.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:43.640]   But I will also touch on some parallel themes
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:45.600]   as it relates to in vitro fertilization
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.120]   and intrauterine insemination, okay?
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:52.800]   So the idea here is that we want the maximum number
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:56.760]   of high quality sperm that is rapidly forward motile sperm
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:59.600]   that are of the correct morphology that is shape,
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.240]   that's going to require a lot of mitochondria
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.440]   in the mid region, a well-shaped head.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.200]   So it's going to be an oval shaped head.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.840]   The tail is going to be a single tail, not multiple tails.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.360]   These aren't going to be the twitcher type of,
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.560]   or immotile type of sperm that are either twitching in place
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.800]   or aren't moving forward.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.400]   All of those components are going to be essential
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.320]   for increasing the probability of fertilization.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.000]   But of course there's the female side of it too,
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.400]   which is that ovulation occurs on just one day
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.720]   during the menstrual ovulatory cycle.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:31.500]   And that egg will be available for fertilization
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.560]   for approximately 24 hours.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.880]   Now keep in mind that the sperm can survive
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.760]   within the vaginal duct and within the area
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.720]   around the cervix and within the uterus
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.380]   and along the female reproductive tract
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:45.240]   for anywhere from three to five,
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:47.720]   or it's even been described as up to seven days,
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.480]   but generally it's going to be about three to five days.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:54.320]   Now, most women can figure out the day of their ovulation
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.480]   by counting the total number of days of their typical cycle.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.600]   And this is where it's really useful to have a cycle
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.320]   that's of more or less regular duration
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.560]   or rather of more or less regular length.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.520]   So as we talked about earlier,
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.400]   if somebody's cycle is 21 days or 25 days
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.440]   and it's 21 or 25 days consistently
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.440]   or even 30 days consistently,
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.200]   that's going to be a far better scenario
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.200]   to favor fertilization than if it's 20 days one month
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.480]   and then 21 days the next month,
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.960]   but then suddenly 30 days and then suddenly 35 days.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:28.100]   Those varying durations of the ovulatory cycle
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.400]   make it very hard obviously to time
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.820]   and understand when ovulation is going to occur.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.740]   So regular duration ovulatory cycles
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.380]   are the ideal circumstance.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.720]   And they're the ideal circumstance
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.640]   because even though the egg is only available
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.860]   for fertilization for a few days,
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:45.840]   those sperm can survive for some period of time,
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840]   which leads to the issue of
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:51.080]   how often should couples be having intercourse?
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.040]   And here I'm referring specifically
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.500]   to intercourse with ejaculation.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.620]   How often should couples be having intercourse
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.400]   around the time of ovulation
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.640]   if the specific goal is successful fertilization
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.120]   of the egg and the creation of a baby, okay?
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.120]   This is leaving aside all issues,
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.440]   which of course are interesting issues
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:12.280]   related to how often people are having intercourse,
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.900]   whether or not there's ejaculation
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.640]   every time they have intercourse or not
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.420]   for sake of pleasure or for sake of pair bonding and pleasure
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.260]   or for sake of any number of other
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:22.960]   potential goals of intercourse.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.960]   Here I'm only referring to intercourse
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.480]   as it relates to the goal of fertilization of the egg, okay?
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:34.480]   So knowing what we know about spermatogenesis
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.900]   and the fact that ejaculate is going to contain
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.920]   a certain concentration of sperm,
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.920]   but that within that ejaculate,
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.280]   some of the sperm will be older and less healthy
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.000]   and some will be optimally mature
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.760]   and some might even be a little bit immature,
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.800]   although there's a tendency for the immature sperm
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.840]   to not have yet exited the seminiferous tubules,
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.920]   gone into the epididymis and vas deferens.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.880]   But given that the ejaculate contains sperm
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.360]   of varying ages and therefore varying quality,
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.120]   and given that with each successive ejaculation
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.180]   in a short period of time,
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.400]   there's going to be a decrease in the concentration of sperm
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.080]   per milliliter of semen of ejaculate,
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.120]   we can make some good arguments
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.340]   as to how often couples should have intercourse
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:21.880]   with ejaculation around the time of ovulation
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.320]   if the goal is to fertilize.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:26.360]   If ovulation occurs on, for instance, day 14 of a cycle,
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.400]   here we're using the kind of standard average of 28 days
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.680]   of the cycle, but for some people with a 30-day cycle,
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:36.140]   that could be day 15 or with a shorter cycle,
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:37.880]   it could be day 12, for instance,
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.360]   but given a 28-day average cycle,
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.260]   let's say ovulation occurs on day 13 or on day 14,
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:48.300]   and typically would occur on day 14 of a 28-day cycle.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:51.720]   Well, then given how long sperm can survive
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.160]   inside of the woman,
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.600]   you might think that the optimal strategy would be
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.360]   to have as much intercourse with ejaculation
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.620]   in the three or four days leading up to ovulation,
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.540]   hope that those sperm swim as far as they possibly can
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:06.920]   and will encounter the egg just as soon as possible
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.360]   after it ovulates.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.240]   It turns out that's not the optimal strategy.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.440]   The optimal strategy is really to maximize
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.600]   the concentration of healthy sperm within each ejaculate
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.000]   and to really center that around the day of ovulation.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.280]   So what this involves generally
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.260]   and what the typical recommendation is,
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:28.640]   is to abstain from intercourse with ejaculation
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.340]   about two or three days out from ovulation,
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:34.700]   and then on the day prior to ovulation
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:37.440]   and on the day of ovulation,
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.540]   to essentially introduce as much semen and ejaculate
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:45.460]   into the reproductive pathway of the female as possible.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.700]   Okay, now that's the general recommendation
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:51.740]   that the OB/GYNs and the urologists that I spoke to gave,
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:54.080]   but you will also hear a different strategy.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.560]   It's only slightly different,
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.640]   but the different strategy involves
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:00.840]   trying to maximize the concentration of healthy sperm
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:02.720]   within each ejaculate with the understanding
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:04.740]   that with each subsequent ejaculation
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:06.960]   over about a 24-hour period,
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.280]   that there's going to be a dramatic reduction
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.460]   in the concentration of sperm.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.600]   What that means is that if a couple, for instance,
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:15.120]   were to have intercourse with ejaculation
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.200]   many times on the day prior to ovulation,
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.760]   yes, that will introduce a lot of sperm
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.320]   into the reproductive pathway of the female,
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.460]   but what it means is that on the day of ovulation,
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:26.920]   if they were to have intercourse,
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.120]   the number of high-quality sperm
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.520]   that will be available to the egg
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.720]   will be greatly diminished,
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.240]   and if none of the sperm that were introduced
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:38.500]   in the day prior managed to fertilize that egg,
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.760]   well, then essentially chances are off
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.320]   that there will be fertilization
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:43.680]   or they're greatly diminished.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.660]   Rather, if they're having intercourse with ejaculation
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:50.120]   once or twice on the day prior to ovulation
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.840]   and then a maximum number of times with ejaculation
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.320]   on the day of ovulation,
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:58.680]   that itself can maximize the probability of fertilization.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:00.000]   So which strategy is optimal?
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.580]   Should couples have as much intercourse with ejaculation
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:06.440]   on the day prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation,
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.880]   or should they have intercourse
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.520]   on the day prior to ovulation,
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.160]   but not so frequently
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.600]   that it diminishes the concentration of sperm
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.280]   and then allows for intercourse
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:20.040]   with the maximum number of ejaculations
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:23.020]   on the day of ovulation, you really hear it both ways.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.360]   And what this really boils down to
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.360]   is frankly that nobody knows.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.520]   And the reason nobody knows
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.760]   is that there's tremendous variation among males
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:32.200]   in terms of the absolute concentration
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.500]   of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:40.280]   and the amount of sperm per milliliter of ejaculate
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:41.800]   within a given timeframe.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:45.800]   But what everyone agrees on is that a period of abstinence
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:49.840]   ranging from 48 to 72 hours prior to an ejaculation
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.800]   increases the concentration of high quality sperm
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.120]   within that first ejaculation to occur
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.880]   after the abstinence period, okay?
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.960]   So again, to reiterate,
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.820]   if one's goal is to fertilize the egg,
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.760]   you want to take into consideration that most often
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.380]   there's going to be a dramatic decline
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.080]   in the concentration of sperm per ejaculate
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.280]   anytime those ejaculations are occurring
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.400]   within a short period of time,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.280]   say within 12 to 24 hours of one another.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:18.000]   Now, all of this, of course,
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.200]   also relates to the female biology
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.760]   and the extent to which the woman can precisely identify
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.800]   the day and timing of her ovulation.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.840]   Some women feel as if, and indeed are very accurate
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:33.600]   at estimating their time of ovulation
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.000]   to within a couple of hours,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.800]   or some women even report being able to feel
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.440]   their actual ovulation,
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.400]   whether or not they are feeling the ovulation itself,
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.960]   the deployment of the egg or not isn't clear.
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.000]   I certainly would know.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.940]   I've never produced eggs, nor have I ovulated,
[01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:49.680]   and I'm certainly not going to contest the idea
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.460]   that women can do that.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:56.200]   I mean, it makes sense that some people have a very keen
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.960]   so-called interoceptive awareness,
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:01.300]   an awareness of the sensory events within their body.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.360]   And while, of course, the ovaries are not thought of
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:06.360]   as an organ that we want to be able to sense
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.640]   what's going on in there in terms of feel,
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.540]   there are sensory endings within the ovary.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:14.160]   And so the notion that one could literally sense
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.360]   changes within their ovary,
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.780]   including the deployment of the egg,
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:19.860]   is not outside the bounds of reason.
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:21.940]   And in fact, could likely be the case.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:25.080]   Now, that said, there are a number of different ways
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.560]   that women will track their ovulation.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.000]   One is the temperature method.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.880]   So they'll actually measure intravaginal temperature.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:32.360]   They're looking for changes in temperature
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:35.120]   that are consistent around the time of ovulation.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.800]   We're going to have an expert guest on an OB-GYN
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.400]   who can tell us a lot more about the details
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.960]   and nuances of the temperature method.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.740]   You'll see a lot of information about this online,
[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:46.620]   but there's a lot of misunderstanding about it as well.
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:49.260]   Other women will use apps that take into account
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.840]   either the temperature information,
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:53.680]   if they're acquiring temperature information,
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:54.920]   that'll be entered into the app,
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.840]   as well as marking the onset of menstruation,
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:59.800]   the onset of bleeding,
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.800]   therefore the start of the ovulatory cycle.
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:03.060]   Because of course, as we mentioned earlier,
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.840]   that marks day one of their cycle.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.280]   And then again and again,
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.960]   you can see how regularity of cycle duration
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:11.720]   or relative regularity of cycle duration
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.200]   really favors this whole process
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:16.240]   of being able to predict when one ovulates.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.440]   And fortunately, if the goal is fertilization,
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.800]   there are some margins for error
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.000]   that are introduced by the fact that
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.680]   the sperm can survive within the female reproductive tract
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:29.820]   for some period of days,
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:33.680]   thereby reducing the need for absolute certainty
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:36.000]   about the time of ovulation and so on.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.720]   In fact, it's pretty well known
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.820]   that around the time of ovulation,
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:40.700]   a couple of things happen.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.000]   Earlier, we talked about one thing,
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.420]   which is there's an increase in libido
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:44.920]   just prior to ovulation.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.480]   This relates to impart an increase in some of the androgens,
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:52.840]   things like DHEA, but also testosterone
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:57.080]   and some related androgens that can increase libido
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.160]   both in males and females.
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:03.080]   And changes to the reproductive pathway, the female,
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.460]   in particular, a change in the pH,
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:08.900]   that is the relative acidity versus basic nature
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.200]   of the mucosal lining near the cervix
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.100]   and also vaginal secretions,
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.620]   such that around the time of ovulation,
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.860]   the entire milieu of the vagina and the cervix
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.700]   and the locations in which fertilization can occur
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.700]   and certainly in which the sperm are swimming
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.800]   towards the opportunity for fertilization
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.080]   is shifted to support sperm motility and health.
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:32.940]   In other words, one of the best environments
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:35.880]   for sperm to survive is going to be within
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:38.280]   the female reproductive pathway itself.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.760]   And as long as we're talking about vaginal secretions
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.160]   and mucus, it's important to point out
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.060]   that a number of commercially available lubricants
[01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:48.400]   can actually be detrimental for sperm health,
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.340]   even if they don't contain spermaticide.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:52.840]   So this is something that you'll want to discuss
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.840]   with your OB/GYN or certainly if you're male,
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:58.920]   you could also discuss this with your urologist
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.700]   and your partner's OB/GYN.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.140]   A lot of the commercially available lubricants
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:07.380]   contain chemicals that while they may favorably
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:10.180]   change the consistency or the viscosity
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:13.860]   of the vaginal pathway for purposes of intercourse,
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.700]   certainly may not be the most favorable
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:18.900]   for maintaining the health of the sperm
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:20.020]   and the motility of the sperm.
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:23.220]   So again, here we're talking about intercourse
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:26.380]   only in the context of trying to maximize fertilization.
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.220]   And I should mention that there are certain lubricants
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.660]   that are more conducive to the sperm environment,
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:33.460]   but it's something that you'll really want to talk
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.560]   to your OB/GYN about, or at least read up about
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.880]   if your interest is in trying to fertilize
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:40.060]   and develop an embryo.
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:41.760]   So we covered the optimal strategies
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:44.880]   for how often couples should have intercourse
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.100]   with ejaculation around the time of ovulation
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:50.340]   in order to maximize the probability
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.060]   that successful fertilization
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.540]   and ultimately pregnancy will occur.
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.540]   What we haven't covered yet, however,
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:57:01.320]   is how long couples should apply that method over time
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:04.420]   in order to achieve successful fertilization and pregnancy.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:06.040]   Now, of course, if a couple decides
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.660]   that they want to conceive and they apply that method
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:11.100]   or any other method, for instance,
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:14.700]   and they achieve fertilization and a successful pregnancy
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:16.760]   the very first month that they try,
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:18.460]   well, then there's no other work to do
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:20.000]   at least until that child is born
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.940]   and if and only if they decide
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.060]   they want to have more children.
[01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:27.320]   However, many couples find that they do not conceive
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.980]   in the first month of trying,
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.920]   even when they apply the optimal methods
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.600]   and even if their age and every other factor
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.800]   related to egg quality and sperm quality is optimized.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.620]   Now, I think it's the rare instance
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:41.940]   in which egg quality and sperm quality are optimized.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:44.260]   In fact, the word optimal and optimization
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:46.340]   and optimized is a little bit misleading in general
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.360]   because no one really knows what that is.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.860]   But of course, there is an ideal,
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:51.660]   there's a perfect standard
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.600]   to which everyone would like to achieve.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.580]   But of course, we all enter the picture
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:58.500]   with genetic variables, environmental variables,
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:00.780]   and so forth, many of which we'll talk about
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.580]   because you can in fact adjust them
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.660]   in the direction that you would like
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.820]   to improve sperm and egg quality,
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:09.780]   but most people simply will not succeed
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.660]   in achieving a successful fertilization
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:14.500]   the first month that they try.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:17.020]   Now, there is a truth that governs
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:19.620]   how many tries it ought to take
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:22.540]   in order to achieve successful fertilization
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.680]   and ultimately pregnancy.
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:26.100]   And it's very age dependent and in particular,
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.340]   it's dependent on the age of the mother
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:30.540]   because the age and quality of the egg,
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.900]   while it's not the only factor,
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:35.940]   is certainly one of the most determining factors
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.320]   in whether or not successful fertilization occurs.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.580]   And as women age,
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:42.220]   the quality of the eggs tends to diminish over time,
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.940]   largely due to changes in the mitochondrial function
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.540]   and the spindle that pulls the chromosomes apart,
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:50.320]   although there could be other factors involved as well.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.740]   Now, before continuing any further,
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:53.780]   I just want to acknowledge that this whole language
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.580]   around egg quality and sperm quality
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:58.020]   is not the greatest language
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:00.300]   because it's entirely subjective.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.620]   And yet the word quality in these instances
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.740]   is really there to explain a broad variety of factors
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:08.020]   that can in fact be measured.
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.860]   Things like the number of follicles
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:12.620]   that are deployed each month in a woman's ovulation
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:14.740]   or the number of motile sperm
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:16.820]   or the number of morphologically
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:19.500]   that is correctly shaped sperm in the male and so forth.
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.420]   So when we talk about egg quality or sperm quality,
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:25.580]   we're really referring to an amalgam of different features
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:28.980]   related to the different aspects of ovulation
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.740]   leading to successful fertilization
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.620]   or the different aspects of sperm
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.660]   related to whether or not they can arrive
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:36.660]   and deliver their DNA contents and so forth.
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:39.220]   So I will use the words egg quality and sperm quality
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:40.140]   just as general themes
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:42.800]   because that's what a lot of the clinicians use.
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.120]   But I do understand that it's a little bit of a loaded term
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:46.380]   in both instances,
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:50.560]   and it doesn't relate to any one specific parameter per se.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.140]   So getting back to this issue of how long couples should try
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:55.500]   according to the age of the female
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:57.300]   and perhaps also the age of the male.
[01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:59.820]   Well, most of the data that have been collected
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:02.440]   relate to the age of the females I mentioned before.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.300]   And what we're about to discuss
[02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:05.960]   is within the scientific literature
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:08.620]   described as what's called fecundability,
[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:12.340]   which is the amount of time over which a given couple
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:14.220]   needs to attempt to conceive,
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.820]   of course, by having intercourse with ejaculation
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:18.820]   around the time of ovulation.
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.260]   It assumes that all the other things
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:22.140]   are being done correctly.
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:24.220]   And what we know is that there's a strong
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:25.740]   age dependent effect
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:28.380]   that largely rests on the age of the egg
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.980]   that is of the female.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:34.980]   And what we know is that for females 30 years old or younger,
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:38.600]   if they have intercourse with ejaculation
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:39.840]   around the time of ovulation,
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.200]   say on the day before and on the day of ovulation,
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.660]   and there could be other intercourse with ejaculation
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:47.820]   around that time as well.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:50.380]   On average, that will result
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:52.360]   in a successful fertilization in pregnancy
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.920]   about 20% of the time
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.680]   on the first month of attempting,
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.820]   the first ovulation cycle.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:01.780]   Now, if fertilization in pregnancy occurs, great, right?
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:03.280]   There'll be at least a nine month lag
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.780]   until they decide whether or not
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:06.600]   they want to try and conceive again.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.680]   However, most couples,
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:11.300]   even if the woman is 30 years old or younger
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:15.020]   will not successfully conceive on that first attempt.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:18.340]   And that's because the probability is not 100%, it's 20%.
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:21.400]   So 80% of the time they simply will not conceive,
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:24.780]   which means that they hopefully will try again
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.040]   the very next month.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.380]   And if they successfully conceive, great.
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.140]   And if they don't, then they ought to try again
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.020]   the next month, the next month and so forth.
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:35.580]   Now, the typical advice that an OB-GYN would give you
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:39.260]   is that for a woman 30 years or younger
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:42.940]   and leaving aside the age of the father,
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:46.920]   but still assuming that egg quality and sperm quality
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.740]   are sufficiently high to achieve fertilization,
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:52.780]   that the couple should,
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:54.340]   or if the woman's trying to have kids alone,
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.300]   the woman should attempt to conceive
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.240]   over the period of six months, why?
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.080]   Well, if you think about it,
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.180]   if there's a 20% chance in the first month
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:05.540]   and it's unsuccessful, well, then on the second month,
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:07.020]   there'll also be a 20% chance,
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:09.020]   on the third month also a 20% chance.
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:11.900]   What I'm describing here is what obviously
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:14.540]   is independent probabilities.
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.260]   That is, if you were to flip a coin
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:18.300]   and the probability of getting heads is 50%,
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:21.580]   the probability of getting tails is 50%, of course,
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.960]   you don't expect that the previous flip
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:25.340]   had anything to do with the result
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:26.660]   that you'll get on the subsequent flip.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:28.320]   That's what independent probabilities are.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:32.000]   However, when it comes to fecundability,
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.280]   we're really talking about something
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:35.780]   which is called cumulative pregnancy rate,
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:38.200]   which is not really independent probabilities.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.260]   Now, why would that be?
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:41.740]   Why would it be that if you did not successfully conceive
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:43.320]   in the first month of trying,
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:45.760]   that by simply trying again and again and again,
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.020]   the probability of conceiving would increase?
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:49.320]   Well, the reason for that
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.160]   is that this whole business of fertilization
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.100]   is not just about what's happening with the egg,
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.300]   it's also about what's happening with the sperm.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.280]   So there are a number of different events
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.980]   related to the biology of the egg
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:00.440]   and the biology of the sperm,
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:01.820]   which you are now very familiar with
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:03.980]   from everything I've talked about up until now.
[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:06.240]   And there are a bunch of chance events,
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.380]   for instance, that the sperm won't actually arrive
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:09.340]   at the egg in time,
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:12.220]   or that the egg won't arrive at the sperm in time,
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.020]   because of course it's a bi-directional migration
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:14.900]   of those two cell types,
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:18.200]   or that for whatever reason, fertilization won't occur.
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:19.440]   So what we're really talking about
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:22.860]   when we talk about the cumulative pregnancy rate over time
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:25.980]   is the fact that there are multiple probabilities at work.
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:28.120]   And yes, those are somewhat independent
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:30.100]   in the sense that the biology of the sperm
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:32.500]   doesn't really strictly depend on the biology of the egg,
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.540]   at least not until they meet and fertilize,
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:37.740]   but the likelihood of pregnancy
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:39.940]   depends on those independent probabilities,
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:42.780]   which makes this a cumulative pregnancy rate.
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.100]   Now, if any of that is confusing,
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:45.700]   what it basically means is that
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:47.780]   for the egg and the sperm to meet and to fertilize,
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.080]   a number of different events
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.080]   that carry some intentionality, right?
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.760]   The sperm swims towards the egg and so forth,
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:56.800]   the egg doesn't have a personality in there,
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:57.780]   at least not yet,
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:00.220]   but it quote unquote wants to be fertilized, right?
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:03.560]   It is in principle receptive to fertilization.
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:06.220]   Well, in order for that to happen,
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:08.060]   there are going to be some events related to chance
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:10.380]   that could limit the ability for that to happen,
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:11.700]   and there'll be other events dictated
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:13.340]   by the biology of those two cell types
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.760]   that are driving that event to happen,
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.820]   that are biasing the event to yes, happen.
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.080]   And so what we're talking about
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.120]   when we talk about cumulative pregnancy rate
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.260]   is how much of the biology of the woman
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:27.900]   is skewed towards fertilization to be likely to occur, okay?
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:30.060]   So to make this very simple,
[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:31.080]   all we need to know is that
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.300]   for women 30 years old or younger,
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:36.180]   because the probability of getting pregnant
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:41.180]   on any one attempt to conceive is 20%,
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.580]   well, then if that doesn't occur the first time,
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:46.020]   then she should simply repeat that
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:48.440]   at least five and probably six times
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.540]   before deciding to go to an OB-GYN
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.520]   and conclude that there's something going on
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:53.360]   either with the egg,
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.240]   or of course it could be with the sperm, okay?
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:57.120]   Because 20 times five is 100,
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:58.720]   so we're talking about cumulative percent.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.400]   So 20, 40, 60, 80, 100,
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:05.540]   and the six month there would take you to 120%,
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:07.600]   which is a different thing altogether.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.720]   But in general, that's why OB-GYNs
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:10.860]   will tell their female patients,
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:12.720]   "Look, if you're setting out to conceive,
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.420]   try for about five or six months,
[02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:17.180]   and if you're not successful, come back and see me."
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:21.400]   Now, for women who are age 31 to 33,
[02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:23.440]   the probability of conceiving in that first month
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.320]   drops to about 18%.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:27.460]   So women in that age range and their partners
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:29.720]   should certainly try and conceive naturally
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:32.040]   over a period of six or seven months
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.680]   in order to get to that 100% cumulative probability.
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:38.040]   And then for women who are age 34 to 37,
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:41.440]   the probability of conceiving in that first month of trying,
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:45.240]   and certainly every month thereafter, is about 11%.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.240]   So when the age of the woman starts extending out
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:49.600]   to about 34 or 35 years old,
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.620]   then the typical advice of the OB-GYN
[02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:53.760]   is going to be to attempt to conceive
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:56.600]   over a period of about nine months to a year
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:00.860]   before deciding to take some sort of medical intervention.
[02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:03.680]   And then of course, as the age of the woman increases,
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:06.480]   so too does the quality of the eggs go down.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:08.040]   Now, that's not true for every woman.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.200]   There are many women who in their late 30s and 40s
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.740]   and even early 50s
[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:14.340]   have successfully conceived healthy children,
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.320]   although the probability of that,
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:18.620]   the likelihood of it drops substantially.
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:21.980]   So for instance, for women who are age 38 to 39,
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:24.380]   the probability of a successful conception
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:27.700]   by natural conception intercourse with ejaculation
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:30.040]   is going to be about 5%, right?
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:32.820]   So it's really dropped to a quarter of what it was
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:35.280]   when that woman was 30.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.000]   Again, these are averages only.
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:37.840]   What does that mean?
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:41.080]   Well, it means that if you are age 38 or older,
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:44.620]   chances are that you should probably go to your OB-GYN
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.780]   right at the outset of your desire to conceive
[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:49.160]   and ask what you can do to improve egg quality.
[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:51.540]   Otherwise, if you were to extend the math out, right?
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:53.780]   We know that if you're age 30 or younger,
[02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:55.840]   20% chance in any one given month,
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.980]   that means about four to six months of trying,
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:02.120]   well, you can simply multiply that times four or five
[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:05.080]   for someone in their late 30s or early 40s.
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:06.280]   And so what you're really talking about
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:07.520]   is several years of trying
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:08.400]   and of course what's happening
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.760]   during those several years,
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:11.920]   the woman is getting older and as a consequence,
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:14.740]   the quality of the eggs is declining even further.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:18.760]   So if you are 35, 36 years old,
[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.520]   it might not be entirely unreasonable
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:22.640]   to talk to your OB-GYN right at the outset
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:24.240]   of desiring to conceive,
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:25.780]   but you could also just take the approach
[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:27.220]   of trying to conceive naturally
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.000]   for about a year or a year and a half
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.320]   before deciding to do that.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.320]   Keeping in mind that all the while you can't stop time,
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:34.840]   so biological time and aging
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:36.840]   is going to occur in the backdrop.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:40.400]   But hopefully this description of cumulative pregnancy rate
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.240]   makes sense.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:43.820]   Again, the idea is that while it's true
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:47.080]   that every single month there's an independent chance
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:49.720]   of the woman getting pregnant,
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:53.320]   and that chance is dropping from about 20% at age 30
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:57.680]   over time to about really one to 3% for women 40 or older.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:00.420]   There's also this notion of cumulative probability,
[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:02.680]   which involves multiple biological events
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:04.120]   in both the egg and the sperm
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:06.440]   that have to converge in time and space
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:08.960]   in order for successful fertilization to occur.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.120]   As long as we're on this topic,
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.600]   I think it's only fair to address the issue of miscarriage.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.300]   And miscarriages can arise from a variety of sources.
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:18.400]   They can arise from genetic defects,
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.580]   they can arise from issues in the milieu of the uterus,
[02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:24.640]   they can arise from issues with the sperm for that matter.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:26.820]   We really don't want to put all the weight
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:29.240]   and all the responsibility on the egg.
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:31.280]   This is always an egg sperm dynamic.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:32.940]   And when I say egg sperm dynamic,
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:34.440]   now hopefully that calls to mind
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.840]   the huge library of information
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:37.000]   that we've been covering up until now
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.920]   about chromosomal segregation and the coming together
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:42.800]   of these different cell types and their genetic information.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:44.360]   Any number of different steps
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:47.420]   within the process of fertilization leading up to pregnancy
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:49.440]   can lead to miscarriage.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:52.740]   However, the probability of miscarriage
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:57.520]   greatly increases as a function of the age of the egg.
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:00.020]   And the basic numbers on this
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:04.000]   are that for women who are 35 years or older,
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.000]   about 25% of successful fertilizations lead to miscarriages.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.080]   Now, when those miscarriages occur during pregnancy
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:13.280]   can be highly variable.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:15.240]   Sometimes it's within the first trimester,
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:17.320]   sometimes it could be later,
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:20.380]   but the probability is about 25%.
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:24.120]   That probability increases greatly over time
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:27.160]   such that by the time women are in their early 40s,
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:29.720]   so 40 or older, the probability of miscarriage
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.640]   after a successful fertilization is going to be about 50%.
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.760]   And this could be due to a number of factors
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:36.840]   as I mentioned before,
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.400]   but one common reason
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:41.380]   is that there can be chromosomal abnormalities,
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:43.540]   and that could be related typically
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.360]   to the segregation of the egg
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.960]   when half of the chromosomes in that egg are removed,
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.600]   taking it from diploid to haploid.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:53.040]   If you recall, there's that little polar body,
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.040]   which is the removal of the chromosomes
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:58.560]   that's ejected from the egg that will eventually ovulate.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:00.420]   And sometimes not all the chromosomes
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:03.880]   that were supposed to be ejected in that polar body
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:05.360]   are ejected and as a consequence,
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.760]   there are multiple chromosomes
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:09.500]   or duplications of chromosomes, things like trisomies.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.500]   Sometimes too many chromosomes move away
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.660]   and they're actually removal of entire chromosomes,
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:16.540]   meaning both strands so that you have chromosomal deletions.
[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:19.380]   And in that case, typically fertilization won't occur,
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:21.740]   but there are instances in which fertilization will occur.
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:23.860]   So a woman will get a positive pregnancy test,
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:25.540]   her periods will stop.
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.880]   And the couple will think that they're advancing
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.040]   along the steps to a successful pregnancy,
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.820]   and then there will be sadly a miscarriage.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:37.280]   Many, many times those miscarriages are the consequence
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:40.080]   of the fact that when there are extra chromosomes there
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.640]   or there are too few chromosomes present,
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:48.480]   that embryogenesis can simply not progress in a healthy way.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.800]   There are some instances in which all of the chromosomes
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:54.160]   and all the chromosomal arrangements are perfectly normal
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:57.040]   and miscarriages can still occur.
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.060]   I'm going to do a future episode about pregnancy
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:01.340]   and embryonic development,
[02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:03.120]   where we will get into this more deeply,
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:06.380]   but just understand that the frequency of miscarriages
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:10.200]   increases dramatically after about age 34,
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.820]   and then continues to increase dramatically,
[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:15.140]   extending well out until the 40s.
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.960]   Now, a very important consideration
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:19.480]   in terms of understanding and predicting fertility
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.000]   and fecundability, this word that describes the probability
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.360]   of getting pregnant on a given try and over time
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.360]   is trying to address how quote unquote fertile a woman is,
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:36.000]   and importantly, how quote unquote fertile a male is.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.520]   And we'll talk about the male side in a moment,
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:41.560]   but when trying to address how fertile a woman is,
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:44.840]   of course, age is going to be one of the major factors,
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.800]   but just one factor, right?
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:49.660]   We already talked about how age determines the likelihood
[02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:51.240]   of a successful pregnancy.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.560]   If the intercourse and ejaculation is being carried out
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:58.600]   at the correct times and with viable sperm
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:00.840]   capable of fertilizing eggs,
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:03.080]   and then of course there's the issue of egg quality,
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:05.960]   but in general, most women would like to know
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:10.120]   how fertile they are as a function of their age, right?
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:12.320]   And I actually think this is one of the most important
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.740]   topics in this whole space around fertility
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:17.520]   that isn't often discussed or at least isn't often discussed
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:20.880]   until women are in their late 30s or 40s,
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:23.080]   when oftentimes they will look back
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:24.960]   and wish that either they had frozen their eggs
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:27.060]   or they had frozen fertilized embryos,
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.520]   which is a whole thing unto itself.
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.540]   Let me talk about that when we have an episode
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:34.120]   on in vitro fertilization in more depth,
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:38.440]   but there is a fairly straightforward way or set of ways
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.680]   that women can determine their basic level of fertility.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:44.760]   Leaving aside a lot of the detailed issues
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:47.040]   about the quality of eggs and so forth,
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:48.920]   one thing that you already learned is that
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.660]   there's this vault, there's this reserve
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:52.320]   that we call the ovarian reserve,
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:55.520]   and that each month a certain number of follicles
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:59.240]   leave that reserve and there's the opportunity
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.000]   based on the ovulation of a single egg
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.360]   to fertilize that egg and for the woman to get pregnant.
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.680]   And one thing that we know for sure is that
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.680]   the size of the population that's released from that vault
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.360]   each month has a very strong positive correlation
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:19.720]   with the size of the reserve in the vault itself, okay?
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:23.080]   So the way to think about this perhaps is that
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.520]   the vault is like a bank account,
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.480]   has a certain amount of money or in this case eggs in it.
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:31.980]   And you could imagine if someone's reasonably logical
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.280]   that if they have more money in their bank account,
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.520]   then they're going to withdraw a larger amount each month
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:38.960]   than if they have a small amount each month
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:43.200]   if the idea is to make that vault, that bank of eggs
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:46.860]   available to them over the longest period of time.
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:48.740]   And indeed biology is pretty smart.
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:53.360]   It doesn't deploy or release half the follicles in one month
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:56.120]   and then just slowly trickle out the remainder of follicles.
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:57.040]   No, that's not how it works.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.820]   What you find is that of course in younger women,
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:04.020]   so say in their late teens, 20s and 30s,
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.740]   the ovarian reserve in the vault
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:07.620]   is going to have more eggs in it.
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:09.940]   And the number of follicles and eggs
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:12.620]   that leave that vault each month is going to be quite high.
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:17.620]   So one way to evaluate how quote unquote fertile you are,
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:20.840]   again, just one way is to go to your OBGYN
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.200]   and say that you would like to know
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.840]   how many follicles you have in a given month.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.560]   And of course, they'll look at them on both sides
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:28.120]   in both ovaries.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:31.200]   And for instance, if a woman has, you know,
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:34.600]   just two or three follicles that are out each month,
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:37.180]   well then the assumption, again, it's just an assumption,
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:39.200]   but the assumption that's pretty good
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.360]   because there's this positive correlation
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:44.920]   that generally occurs is that that ovarian reserve
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:48.280]   that the number of eggs in the vault is fairly low
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.880]   compared to someone who say has 20 follicles
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:53.160]   or 30 follicles each month, okay?
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.440]   And that's the typical trend.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.520]   Again, these are averages.
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.480]   And it's very important to not get attached
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.720]   to any one number here.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:00.160]   Again, these are averages.
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.600]   So for instance, there are women
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.320]   who only deploy five follicles and eggs each month
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:07.880]   out of their ovarian vault,
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:10.480]   but who find themselves to be very fertile, right?
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.760]   And there could be a number of different factors
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:12.600]   to explain that.
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:15.760]   Other women will have 20 or 30 eggs and follicles
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:18.400]   that leave that vault, the ovarian reserve each month,
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:20.200]   and they will have a harder time getting pregnant
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:21.460]   for any number of different reasons.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:23.940]   But in general, the more eggs and follicles
[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:26.320]   that leave the vault each month,
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.760]   the higher number of eggs that are still in reserve,
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:30.480]   meaning the greater amount of time
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:33.540]   over which a given woman could still attempt
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:35.900]   to have successful fertilizations.
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:39.200]   Now this small collection of follicles and eggs
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:41.040]   that are released each month actually has a name.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:42.340]   They're called antral follicles.
[02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:43.340]   These are small follicles.
[02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:45.840]   They tend to be about two to nine millimeters across.
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:47.680]   The way these are analyzed or measured
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.000]   is women will go into the OBGYN office and by ultrasound,
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.680]   typically there's some local anesthesia,
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.880]   but it's not often a general anesthesia,
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.120]   but by local anesthesia, sometimes no anesthesia,
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.920]   they will essentially count the number of follicles
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:03.520]   that are present in each side,
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:06.720]   on the ovary on the left and the ovary on the right,
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:09.900]   and give a woman some sense of how many follicles she has.
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:12.320]   And typically this is done over a series of months
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.920]   to determine how many eggs are leaving
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:16.200]   the ovarian reserve each month,
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:19.920]   and therefore how many eggs she is likely to still have
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:21.520]   in the ovarian reserve.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:24.120]   Now there's a non-invasive way to do this as well,
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:26.900]   although typically an OBGYN will do both
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:28.480]   what I just described with ultrasound
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.600]   and measure something called AMH,
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:32.640]   which is anti-Mullerian hormone,
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:34.660]   which is a hormone that is released
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:37.060]   by that antral follicle population,
[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:38.840]   the population of follicles and eggs
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.440]   that leave the ovarian reserve each month.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:44.440]   So one is a blood draw measure of a hormone AMH,
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.760]   the other is a structural imaging measure
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.500]   of the antral follicles directly.
[02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:52.000]   Again, the typical trend is for the number
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.560]   of antral follicles to decline over time.
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:56.440]   So one might expect, for instance,
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.020]   that a woman in her 20s or 30s might have 20, 30,
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:02.180]   maybe even 40 antral follicles
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.760]   that are exiting the reserve each month.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:07.120]   And again, that's the total across both ovaries.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:08.400]   Again, these are just averages,
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:09.560]   these are going to be distributions,
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:10.800]   there will be people with far fewer,
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:12.400]   there will be people with far more,
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:16.960]   but that over time, regardless of where a woman starts out
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:21.960]   from one decade to the next half decade and decade and so on
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:24.440]   that the number of antral follicles will decline
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.800]   and the amount of, or the levels of AMH will also decline.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.580]   So what does this all mean?
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:32.720]   What this means is that if you are a woman
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:37.680]   who is in her 20s or 30s or 40s, whatever your age,
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:40.200]   if you are interested in conceiving in the future,
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:44.560]   it's very likely a good idea to go to your OB/GYN
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:47.240]   and get either your AMH levels measured
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:49.260]   or your follicle count measured.
[02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:52.360]   And to do that several times in a given period,
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:53.480]   and I don't mean a menstrual period,
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:56.100]   I mean a given period of time across several months
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:58.060]   to determine what is the average number of follicles,
[02:17:58.060 --> 02:17:59.820]   what's your average AMH level,
[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:05.040]   thereby giving you some window into how many eggs
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:07.380]   you are likely to still have in your ovarian reserve.
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:09.760]   I cannot tell you how many women that I've spoken to
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:11.760]   and how many OB/GYNs more importantly,
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:13.360]   'cause they speak to many more women about this
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:16.100]   than I ever have or ever will,
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:18.620]   wish that they had done this earlier, right?
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.280]   They think, oh, well, I'm in my 20s,
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:21.760]   so I'm likely to have a ton of follicles,
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:23.480]   or they got pregnant once before
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:25.760]   and so they're not so concerned about the number of follicles
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.160]   or their AMH levels.
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.920]   But over and over again,
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:30.840]   I was told in researching for this episode
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.940]   that the earlier and more frequent
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:36.400]   that women do this procedure of measuring AMH
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:38.520]   and measuring their follicle count,
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:40.660]   the higher the probability that they will eventually
[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:42.880]   have a successful fertilization in pregnancy
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.400]   when they seek to do so.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.960]   Now, the mirror image of all this, of course, is the sperm.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.000]   And there's a kind of common misconception out there
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.560]   that the sperm, you only need one,
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.960]   and indeed you only need one,
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:57.020]   but actually you need many,
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:59.240]   and it's only one that's able
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.240]   to successfully fertilize the egg.
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:03.760]   So this whole concept of you only need one
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:05.640]   is both dismissive of the sperm,
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:07.560]   but more importantly dismissive of the biology
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:09.840]   of the sperm and the egg, okay?
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:13.840]   It only takes one successful sperm and one successful egg,
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:15.280]   but that's sort of like telling a woman,
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.280]   hey, you only need one egg, right?
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:19.840]   You need one egg of sufficient quality
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.980]   in the right time and place,
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:24.720]   and you need one sperm of sufficient quality
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:26.340]   in the right time and place
[02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:28.120]   in order to get successful fertilization
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:29.940]   and hopefully pregnancy.
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.560]   But you need a lot of sperm
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:36.580]   in order to get a high probability
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:38.500]   that that one sperm will be able
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.280]   to successfully fertilize the egg.
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.480]   So we have this image of sperm
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.220]   as kind of these dumb operators
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:46.640]   that just sort of swim mindlessly towards anything.
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:47.980]   I mean, if they bump into an egg,
[02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:48.900]   then they fertilize the egg,
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:50.760]   and that's really not the way it works.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:53.160]   As I talked about earlier, the sperm with its head,
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.500]   its mid-region, its tail,
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:57.280]   chock-a-block with mitochondria in the mid-region
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:59.640]   is really an active motile cell
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:01.940]   that indeed will just swim forward
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:04.500]   if it's a healthy forward progressing sperm.
[02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:06.660]   But, you know, many males out there
[02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:09.000]   just simply do not have any knowledge
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.740]   of how many quality sperm that they happen to have.
[02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:13.420]   Now, given the fact that sperm analysis
[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:15.440]   is relatively inexpensive,
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.600]   and also the fact that freezing sperm
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:19.440]   is relatively inexpensive,
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.120]   I think it stands to reason that most men
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:23.160]   should at least get some window
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:25.840]   into the numbering quality of their sperm.
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:27.240]   Now, it's a fair assumption to say
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:30.480]   that if someone is in their late teens or early 20s
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:33.580]   or 30s that they probably have high quality sperm.
[02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:35.400]   But again, as with the egg
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:37.320]   and the importance of measuring AMH
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:39.880]   and follicle count across time,
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:41.800]   men should really evaluate the quality
[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.800]   and number of their sperm.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:43.960]   And we talked a little bit earlier
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:45.400]   about some of the parameters
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:49.200]   that urologists and OBGYNs like to see
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:50.800]   when evaluating sperm, right?
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:52.520]   You know, there's a minimum number
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.900]   or concentration of sperm that they'd like to see
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:58.000]   if a couple is going to use IVF in vitro fertilization.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.040]   And typically that's going to be
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:03.840]   about 15 to 20 million per mil of sperm or semen.
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:05.260]   And typically they want to see
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:09.400]   somewhere between two and five milliliters of semen overall
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:10.340]   in a given ejaculate
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:13.820]   after a 72 to 48 hour abstinence period.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.860]   Because of course, the more ejaculations,
[02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:18.580]   the smaller the volume of the ejaculate
[02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:21.060]   in a short period of time,
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:23.180]   but after 48 to 72 hours,
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:26.300]   you more or less maximize the volume of ejaculate.
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:28.520]   And then of course, they want to see 50,
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:31.620]   but typically 60% or more of motile sperm
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:33.940]   in order to get IVF, but more is better.
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:35.500]   And of course, there is an enormous range,
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:36.360]   as I mentioned before.
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:40.740]   Some males will have anywhere from 10 to 20 million
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:43.340]   sperm per milliliter of ejaculate,
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:47.580]   and some men will have 100 to 200 million, okay?
[02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:49.340]   But just because they have 100 to 200 million
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:51.980]   doesn't mean that all of those sperm are of high quality
[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:53.820]   and can fertilize eggs sometimes.
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:55.660]   More than half will be twitchers
[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:57.660]   and some will be in motile and so on and so forth.
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:21:59.640]   So it's very straightforward
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.060]   what I believe most people should do
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:02.640]   and what the urologist I spoke to
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:05.460]   in advance of this episode, I had said to do,
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:07.880]   which is to simply do a sperm analysis.
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:11.200]   Refrain from ejaculation for 48 to 72 hours,
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:14.600]   give a sperm sample, have that sperm sample analyzed.
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:18.680]   The cost of the sperm analysis is not typically that much,
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:21.680]   okay, and considering that conception
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:23.480]   and healthy conception and fertilization
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:24.760]   is an expensive process
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:27.560]   if you have to go the in vitro fertilization route,
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:30.040]   it stands to reason that the cost is pretty well justified.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:32.800]   You also have the option to freeze sperm over time.
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:35.280]   There is evidence that the age of the father
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.560]   and therefore the age of the sperm
[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:39.920]   can dictate whether or not there's a higher instance
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:44.400]   of problematic pregnancy or developmental outcomes,
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.600]   including autism, that is true.
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:49.780]   You probably heard that if the father is 40 years or older,
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:52.920]   the incidence of autism is increased significantly.
[02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:56.880]   That is true, although the overall probability
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:59.880]   of having an autistic offspring if somebody,
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:01.680]   if the father that is, is 40 years or older
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:04.840]   is still quite a bit lower than you would imagine.
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:08.320]   It's not as if the probability suddenly skyrockets, okay?
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.340]   So we will have an episode on autism
[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:14.840]   and genetic and non-genetic influences on autism
[02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:16.980]   and other aspects of the autism spectrum.
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:20.560]   But the point is this, I believe,
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:22.360]   and the urologists I spoke to
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.760]   who are interested in fertility and male health
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:29.300]   and sexual health suggests that men get their sperm analyzed
[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.640]   at least once every five years.
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:34.960]   And certainly if they're going to want to conceive children
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.040]   in the distant future,
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:37.660]   that they consider freezing their sperm
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:40.160]   because that too is fairly nominal cost
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.280]   in order to freeze sperm at a younger age.
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.640]   And of course, if you can freeze and use sperm
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.360]   from the time in which you were younger,
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:47.760]   why wouldn't you, right?
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:50.720]   I mean, you can still opt to go for natural pregnancy later
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:51.940]   if that's what you want to do,
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:55.400]   but having that in reserve is generally a good idea.
[02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:57.960]   And I discussed some of the parameters that are looked for.
[02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:00.260]   And perhaps most importantly,
[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:02.780]   there is the possibility of an underlying issue
[02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:04.080]   whereby for instance,
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:09.080]   there is very little sperm in an ejaculate.
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.140]   As I mentioned earlier,
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:11.780]   the seminal fluid in the ejaculate
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:13.060]   could have zero sperm in it,
[02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:15.940]   but the volume of ejaculate could appear completely normal.
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:19.300]   So just because your ejaculate volume is normal to you
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:22.900]   or is in that range of two to five milliliters,
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:24.360]   well then it doesn't necessarily mean
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:25.480]   that there are any sperm there
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:28.040]   or that there are very few sperm there.
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:30.320]   And the few sperm that are there
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:32.960]   or the many sperm that are there are functionally motile.
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:35.500]   So get this analyzed, it's really worth doing.
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:37.440]   And again, it's not something you have to do every year,
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:39.140]   it's something that you want to do
[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:40.320]   probably every five years,
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:41.800]   at least until the point where you've conceived
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:43.840]   as many children as you ever want to conceive.
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:46.480]   So the basic takeaway here is that if you're a woman,
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:50.920]   to get your egg count, your antral follicle count that is,
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.960]   and therefore your reserve of eggs indirectly measured,
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:57.560]   and of course also get your AMH levels measured.
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.680]   And if you're a male to have a sperm analysis
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:01.180]   and to do that relatively early,
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:02.980]   in fact, another incentive for doing that early
[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:04.900]   is that you have a comparison point.
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:07.260]   So that for instance, if you are in your early twenties
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:08.720]   and you're not thinking about having kids at all,
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:10.340]   or you're thinking that you might someday have kids,
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:13.440]   but it's a really someday someday far off in the future,
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:15.800]   well, it's wonderful to have a reference point
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:19.560]   from which to compare your biology in your early twenties
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:22.280]   to your biology in your mid or late thirties or forties,
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:25.400]   when you might happen to be interested in conceiving.
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:28.480]   And if that doesn't provide incentive enough,
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:30.880]   I should mention, and this is important to point out,
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:34.540]   and then I think both males and females are not aware of,
[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:38.900]   is that one in five couples that have issues with fertility,
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:42.900]   the issue ends up falling on the biology,
[02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:46.040]   that is the quality of the sperm or a lack of number
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:46.880]   of sperm.
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:48.680]   So, you know, I think there's a misconception
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.460]   that when fertility is an issue,
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:52.400]   it's always an issue with the eggs
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:55.980]   and this age dependent decline in egg quality,
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:58.320]   again, that's the best language we have available to us
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:01.380]   at the moment, this age dependent decline in egg quality
[02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:03.500]   is often to blame, but not always.
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:06.420]   One in five couples that have challenges conceiving,
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.380]   turns out that it's going to be an issue with the sperm.
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.480]   And of course there are a number of different sperm analyses
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:13.840]   that should all the other parameters of sperm appear normal.
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.680]   Now, for instance, you can get a DNA fragmentation analysis.
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:19.380]   You can see whether or not the DNA of the sperm
[02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:20.980]   are somehow disrupted.
[02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:24.600]   Urologists these days are excellent at figuring out,
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:27.180]   for instance, if a male has lots and lots of sperm,
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:28.020]   everything looks great,
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.980]   but the shape of the head of the sperm isn't quite right.
[02:26:30.980 --> 02:26:33.060]   If it's not oval enough and it's too rounded,
[02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:36.140]   that could be a genetic defect under which conditions
[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:41.140]   there is zero probability of the male ever
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:42.920]   naturally conceiving, right?
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:45.400]   Regardless of who the female partner is, believe it or not,
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.080]   males can have a ton of sperm,
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:49.500]   but if they carry a certain genetic defect,
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:51.960]   those sperm will be incapable of depositing
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.040]   those 23 chromosomes into the egg.
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:59.540]   However, there are ways in which that sperm can be coaxed
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.640]   or forced to fertilize the egg and deposit
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:03.660]   its genetic contents by in vitro fertilization
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:05.220]   and then implantation into the female.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:09.700]   So again, lots of reasons to have a egg reserve analysis
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:11.360]   by ultrasound and AMH for females,
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:15.020]   and lots of reasons for males to have a sperm analysis.
[02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:17.060]   And of course, typically with a sperm analysis
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:22.060]   and a ovarian reserve analysis will be a hormone analysis.
[02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:26.500]   And I'm a very strong believer in people getting an insight
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:29.480]   that is a window into their hormonal composition,
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:31.780]   not just when they encounter problems,
[02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:33.800]   but starting at a pretty early age,
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:36.140]   even if it's only done once every five years or so,
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:39.520]   having a reference point to your 20s and to your 30s
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.580]   and mid 30s for when you felt a certain way,
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:44.200]   maybe as in the case for many people I know,
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.840]   they actually feel better in their 40s
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:46.760]   than they did in their 20s,
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:47.840]   because they're doing a lot of things
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:49.640]   to support their health, that is possible.
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:52.880]   But in many cases, people start feeling not as well,
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:55.060]   or their fertility seems to be dropping off,
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:56.720]   or any number of different parameters
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:58.120]   that we've discussed today
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:27:59.840]   were related to vitality and longevity
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:01.680]   seem to be dropping off over time,
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:04.720]   and they want to get a insight into what could be the issue.
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.320]   And hormones are sometimes not always,
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:09.200]   but sometimes involved in those underlying issues.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:13.160]   And there's nothing as valuable as having a reference point
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.540]   from a time in which things were going well
[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:18.820]   to evaluate the, for instance, the levels of hormones,
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:19.940]   not just testosterone,
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:22.880]   but also estrogen and progesterone and so forth.
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:24.120]   So you need a comparison point
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.560]   in order to determine what really needs to be changed.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:29.420]   So all of this is a strong push for people
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:32.300]   to use your insurance if you're able to put it on insurance,
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:34.460]   oftentimes people are.
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:37.120]   And if not, to try and find a reasonable
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:42.120]   or reasonably priced way to do a sperm and egg analysis,
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:45.240]   and to ideally do a hormone analysis as well.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:46.440]   It's really going to set you up
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.300]   for the maximum probability of being able
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:49.760]   to conceive children when you want to,
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:53.040]   and also to avoid a bunch of other health-related issues
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:56.420]   that involve hormones and reproductive health,
[02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:58.720]   and in general, to support your mental health
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:28:59.840]   and physical health.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:01.960]   So I've been talking about a bunch of things to do.
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:03.980]   There are a couple of things to be mindful of
[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:08.420]   to actively avoid if your goal is to be and remain fertile.
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:10.260]   And that's regardless of whether or not
[02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:13.340]   you want to conceive children in the future or not.
[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:15.060]   Now, in the context of this discussion,
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:17.040]   the same things that we've heard to be true
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:19.880]   for other aspects of our health turn out to also be true.
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:22.720]   So let's just start with the basics.
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:26.680]   Everybody should be getting approximately six to eight hours
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:27.600]   of sleep every night.
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:29.160]   That should be quality sleep.
[02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.080]   Optimizing your sleep is fundamental
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:32.520]   to balancing your hormones.
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.720]   Now, balancing your hormones is kind of a catchphrase
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:38.080]   for all things related to proper hormone regulation.
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.080]   Sleep is the fundamental layer of mental health,
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:42.560]   physical health, and performance of all kinds,
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.760]   and believe it or not, fertility.
[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:47.500]   When people are not sleeping well or enough,
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:49.580]   stress hormones, in particular cortisol,
[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:51.760]   shift to peaking later in the day,
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:54.160]   and those elevated cortisol levels later in the day
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:56.360]   cause a bunch of different problems
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:59.200]   in both males and females, many of which impact fertility.
[02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:02.920]   So controlling cortisol starts with controlling your sleep.
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:06.800]   It also impacts testosterone and estrogen levels.
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:08.880]   So of course the proper ratios of testosterone
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:11.300]   and estrogen will vary from males to females,
[02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:12.880]   but in order to get those right,
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:15.880]   or as right as they can be without other interventions,
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:17.820]   you want to make sure you're getting enough quality sleep.
[02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:18.660]   How much sleep?
[02:30:18.660 --> 02:30:21.700]   Most people need about six to eight hours of sleep per night.
[02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:23.720]   Waking up once, maybe twice per night
[02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:25.320]   in the middle of the night and going back to sleep
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.140]   is not such a big deal,
[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:28.960]   but six to eight hours of solid sleep would be ideal.
[02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:30.240]   Some people need a little bit less
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:32.440]   in order to function, five hours.
[02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:33.560]   Some people need a little bit more.
[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:36.200]   Developing teenagers and babies and kids need a lot more.
[02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:37.960]   People who are sick or recovering from injury
[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:38.800]   need a lot more.
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:40.940]   We've done multiple episodes on sleep.
[02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:43.000]   We have a toolkit for sleep available free
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.400]   at HubermanLab.com.
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:46.160]   You go there, you don't even have to sign up
[02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:47.720]   for the newsletter, although you can if you want.
[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:50.280]   Just go to Toolkit for Sleep under the menu,
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:51.960]   and you'll be able to download that,
[02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:53.080]   or you can even just view it on the screen
[02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:54.040]   if you don't want to download it.
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:54.880]   It has lots of tools.
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:58.140]   We've done an episode called Perfect Your Sleep
[02:30:58.140 --> 02:31:00.060]   that has a lot of tools.
[02:31:00.060 --> 02:31:01.300]   They're all timestamped for you.
[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:02.820]   We've done a Master Your Sleep episodes.
[02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:04.180]   Lots of tools to get your sleep right.
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:07.060]   Get your sleep right if you are wishing to conceive
[02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:09.760]   and/or to simply have healthy biology
[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.160]   to be fertile or otherwise.
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:12.040]   That's just fundamental.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:15.660]   Now, there are other things to not do,
[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:18.480]   and those, again, fall into the somewhat obvious categories,
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:19.740]   but I think a lot of people aren't aware
[02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:24.100]   of just how striking an effect these certain behaviors
[02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:25.500]   that you want to avoid can have
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:28.240]   in diminishing your fertility for both males and females.
[02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:29.080]   So let's talk about those.
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:30.660]   So the first one is smoking.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:32.060]   And when we talk about smoking here,
[02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:34.780]   we're talking about smoking nicotine,
[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:36.680]   and we're talking about smoking cannabis.
[02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:38.340]   And indeed, there are strong data,
[02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:39.680]   and I will put a reference
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:42.360]   to one of the better, larger analyses of these data.
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:43.540]   There are strong data showing
[02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:45.920]   that cannabis reduces fertility.
[02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:48.460]   Now, I can already hear the screams from the back,
[02:31:48.460 --> 02:31:52.380]   although they're probably fairly drawled out screams
[02:31:52.380 --> 02:31:54.820]   from the back of people saying they smoke cannabis
[02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:57.020]   and they had no trouble conceiving.
[02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:58.420]   Certainly there will be exceptions,
[02:31:58.420 --> 02:32:00.400]   but whether or not you're male or female,
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:02.140]   smoking cannabis is a bad idea
[02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:03.900]   if you want to conceive a healthy child.
[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:05.320]   Can you still conceive a healthy child
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:07.660]   while smoking cannabis?
[02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:09.300]   Probably certain people can.
[02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:12.900]   Many people will greatly decrease the probability
[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:16.260]   of a healthy fertilization in pregnancy by smoking cannabis.
[02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:18.980]   There are excellent data to support that.
[02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:22.260]   As well, nicotine, both smoked or vaped,
[02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:27.160]   is going to disrupt the process of fertilization
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:29.660]   and can disrupt pregnancy dramatically, okay?
[02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:31.080]   So just avoid it altogether.
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:31.920]   How does this happen?
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:33.860]   Well, it turns out that smoking increases
[02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:35.580]   what are called reactive oxygen species.
[02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:38.740]   This greatly disrupts the quality of the egg
[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:40.340]   at the level of the spindle and mitochondria
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:41.980]   and a number of other features.
[02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:44.540]   And in the sperm, turns out that smoking
[02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:46.940]   doesn't necessarily disrupt the sperm directly,
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:49.780]   although it can cause DNA fragmentation,
[02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:51.860]   which can cause all sorts of abnormalities,
[02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:53.220]   can prevent fertilization,
[02:32:53.220 --> 02:32:55.100]   can lead to birth defects in the offspring.
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:56.980]   But more importantly,
[02:32:56.980 --> 02:32:59.380]   it increases what are called reactive oxygen species
[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:02.060]   in the seminal fluid, in the semen that contain the sperm.
[02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:04.940]   This very, under normal circumstances,
[02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:06.220]   under healthy circumstances,
[02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:09.240]   beautifully orchestrated chemistry of fluid
[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:13.160]   that allows the sperm to thrive in their trajectory
[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:14.900]   and attempt to fertilize the egg
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:16.280]   and lead to a healthy pregnancy.
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:19.820]   So if you are a smoker and you want to conceive,
[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:21.820]   the best advice I can give you is to quit smoking
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:23.580]   and yes, that includes cannabis as well.
[02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:25.780]   Now, I am not somebody who believes that cannabis
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:27.060]   across the board is not useful.
[02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:29.200]   There are medical applications and other applications.
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.820]   I talk about that in an episode
[02:33:30.820 --> 02:33:33.300]   all about cannabis for health and disease
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:34.840]   and notice health was in there too.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:37.680]   So you cannabis smokers don't come after me with,
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:40.000]   I guess, whatever it is with bongs and pipes
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.140]   or whatever it is that you want or with vapes.
[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:45.200]   The point is that while it can be beneficial
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:48.580]   for certain populations, it's certainly bad for others.
[02:33:48.580 --> 02:33:50.500]   And if you're trying to conceive,
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:54.000]   it is bad for fertility and for a healthy pregnancy, okay?
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.740]   Now that's smoking and vaping, by the way, okay?
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:33:59.440]   Vaping is included there.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.480]   Now the next category of don'ts relates to alcohol.
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:05.780]   Now everyone has heard that drinking during pregnancy
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:07.140]   is a bad idea.
[02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:09.000]   You may have heard and some people have talked about
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.420]   the fact that there are cultures in which they allow,
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:16.360]   if you will, or even condone sadly,
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:19.840]   one or two drinks while pregnant provided it's just champagne
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:20.800]   or something of that sort.
[02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:22.340]   That is a terrible idea.
[02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:24.560]   I did an episode all about alcohol,
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:26.680]   both its potential health effects
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:28.600]   of which there turned out to be zero.
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.520]   And yes, that includes red wine.
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:32.560]   It is far better to not drink at all.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:34.140]   And if you're going to drink the limit,
[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:35.100]   if you're a healthy adult,
[02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:36.800]   who's not trying to conceive not pregnant
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:38.860]   and you don't have issues with alcoholism
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:41.900]   is probably two drinks per week total.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:44.080]   That's right, two drinks per week total.
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:46.320]   And that's the level that you really should consider
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.160]   if you're a drinker,
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.840]   if you're somebody who's trying to conceive.
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:51.480]   However, for a woman who becomes pregnant,
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:52.600]   the total number of drinks
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:54.880]   that you should allow yourself per week while pregnant
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:57.860]   and breastfeeding is indeed zero.
[02:34:57.860 --> 02:34:59.760]   There is absolutely no evidence
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:01.440]   that one can quote unquote get away
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:03.180]   with drinking during pregnancy.
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:04.840]   And people say, well, I had a perfectly healthy child,
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:05.920]   but of course you don't know
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:07.640]   what the health of that child would have been
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.600]   had you not drank at all.
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.920]   Now I'm not here with any generally strong stance
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:12.800]   against alcohol.
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:17.200]   I myself am somebody who has a drink every once in a while,
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:18.880]   although I don't consider myself somebody
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.720]   who has a strong proclivity for alcohol.
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:23.680]   And of course at this moment,
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:25.360]   I'm not trying to conceive children
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:26.880]   and I'm certainly not pregnant.
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:28.880]   So that's safe for me,
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:31.680]   but frankly I haven't had a drink in a very long time.
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:33.520]   And so I don't miss it and that's me,
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.800]   but I do realize that a lot of people enjoy alcohol.
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:38.900]   And so it's that two drinks per week limit
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:41.480]   that really sets the upper limit and threshold
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:43.200]   beyond which you start running into issues
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:45.260]   with cellular mutation.
[02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:48.740]   You start running into issues of oxidative stress,
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:51.080]   greatly increase cancer risk in particular,
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:51.920]   breast cancer risk,
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:54.920]   all that's covered in the alcohol episode that we did.
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:57.440]   You can find it at hubermanlab.com and timestamped
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.720]   if you want to navigate to specific topics and so forth,
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:01.120]   find out all about the data,
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:02.840]   supporting the statements that I'm making,
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:04.080]   so on and so forth.
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:06.300]   Now, if you're somebody who's seeking to conceive
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:07.780]   or you fall into this category
[02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:09.940]   that some couples describe themselves as,
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:12.100]   we're not trying, but we're not not trying,
[02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:13.500]   meaning they're not using birth control.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:16.920]   They're kind of letting chance run its course.
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:18.840]   Well, then you should definitely be aware
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.400]   of the data showing that even just one bout,
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.920]   one bout of so-called binge drinking,
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.440]   which is five to six drinks in a given night
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:30.440]   or half day in a 12 hour period,
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:32.160]   one bout of five to six drinks,
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:35.400]   if you're a woman or you're a man,
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:40.400]   greatly increases both the likelihood of mutations
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:43.960]   in the embryo that would result from a fertilization.
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:46.160]   And at the same time, for reasons that should be obvious
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:48.320]   to you based on all the biology we've talked about,
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:51.020]   a greatly reduced probability of fertilization.
[02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:53.800]   Now, that absolutely does not mean that you should use
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.340]   the ingestion of five or six drinks
[02:36:55.340 --> 02:36:57.520]   as a method of birth control.
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:58.880]   That is not what I'm saying here.
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:02.520]   What I'm saying is that if you go out on a given night
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:04.160]   and you have five or six drinks
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.600]   and you happen to become pregnant,
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:09.280]   the probability that that pregnancy will be disrupted
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:11.720]   in some way is greatly increased.
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:15.120]   What the exact consequences are, no one can tell you.
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:17.920]   But also if you're somebody who is interested
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:21.300]   in conceiving a child, well, then you absolutely
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:26.000]   should abstain from ingesting drinks more than one or two
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.960]   during the time in which you're trying to conceive.
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:29.800]   And ideally it would be zero.
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:31.680]   And you certainly would want to avoid
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:33.620]   drinking multiple drinks per night.
[02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:36.000]   And so this idea of going out and having, you know,
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.240]   three or four drinks or four or five drinks
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:41.280]   in a given night at a time in which you're also trying
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:44.680]   to conceive children, the biology tells us,
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.600]   the epidemiology tells us that this is just a terrible idea.
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:50.200]   It's going to reduce the likelihood of fertility
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.700]   and successful pregnancy.
[02:37:51.700 --> 02:37:53.740]   And if there is a successful pregnancy,
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:56.340]   the word success needs to be in quotes, right?
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:00.180]   I mean, I think every parent, every species for that matter,
[02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:02.440]   wants to increase the probability
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:04.400]   of having healthy offspring.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:07.580]   And so to my mind anyway, and to the OBGYNs
[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:10.000]   and the urologists that are focused on fertility
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.040]   that I spoke to, everyone will say,
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:14.760]   try as hard as you can to avoid
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:16.640]   these so-called binge drinking episodes.
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:18.120]   And again, these episodes are one night
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:19.720]   of consuming five to six drinks.
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:22.020]   Now, another important thing to remember in this context
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:26.000]   is that the negative effects of consuming five or six drinks
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.200]   in a given night extend over many weeks
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.840]   following the ingestion of that alcohol.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.600]   If you're a male, what that means is that's going to impact
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:38.940]   the quality of your sperm and greatly decrease
[02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:41.880]   the likelihood of successful fertilization
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:45.500]   and/or healthy pregnancy over the period
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:48.140]   of that entire spermatogenesis window,
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:52.040]   which is, as we talked about before, 60 to 90 days, right?
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:54.220]   60 to generate the sperm and then in some additional time
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:55.660]   for the sperm to be transported to the point
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:38:57.220]   where they could be ejaculated.
[02:38:57.220 --> 02:39:00.180]   If you're a woman and you have five or six drinks
[02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:02.660]   on a given night, well, then you are going to disrupt
[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:06.940]   the quality, not of just the egg that eventually ovulates,
[02:39:06.940 --> 02:39:09.120]   but indeed the entire pool of follicles
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:11.260]   that leaves the ovarian vault and reserve
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:13.700]   and from which the one egg will be selected.
[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:17.260]   In other words, you are reducing the quality
[02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:20.400]   of all of the eggs that you happened to deploy that month.
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:22.280]   Now, some of you who were really following
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:23.740]   the biology earlier might say,
[02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:25.220]   well, what if I have those five or six drinks
[02:39:25.220 --> 02:39:27.340]   during the time in which I'm menstruating,
[02:39:27.340 --> 02:39:29.820]   just in which there's bleeding present
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:32.560]   and therefore I haven't yet ovulated?
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:34.300]   Ah, but if you remember the biology
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:37.440]   we talked about earlier specifically,
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:39.240]   there is a subset of follicles and eggs
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:43.360]   that leave that ovarian reserve quite a bit before
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:46.300]   that one egg is selected for and ovulates.
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:48.660]   And of course there are all the different hormonal cascades
[02:39:48.660 --> 02:39:50.540]   in the general milieu of the ovary,
[02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:52.540]   which are important and are being regulated
[02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:53.420]   by different hormones.
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:55.940]   And yes, indeed, the regulation of those hormones
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:58.080]   is strongly impacted by alcohol
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:39:59.340]   through a number of different pathways,
[02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:01.680]   through the regulation of the neurotransmitter GABA
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:02.820]   up in the brain, right?
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:04.780]   It's actually a lot of GABA and GABA receptors
[02:40:04.780 --> 02:40:05.620]   in the hypothalamus,
[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:08.400]   the very region from which gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:11.860]   our old friend from a couple hours ago in this discussion,
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:14.140]   going to disrupt GnRH secretion.
[02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:17.100]   You can disrupt pituitary function with alcohol.
[02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:20.280]   Again and again, what we're seeing is that consuming
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:23.580]   more than one or two drinks per week of alcohol
[02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:26.700]   is really detrimental to the entire process of fertility
[02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:29.420]   and the entire process of healthy pregnancy.
[02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:32.120]   And that's true from both the male side and the sperm,
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:34.700]   and it's true from the female side and the egg.
[02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:37.640]   So my simple advice on this is if you are wishing
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:41.000]   to have a healthy fertilization and pregnancy,
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.200]   the best thing to do would be avoid alcohol together.
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.600]   And if you're going to drink to really limit that drinking
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:48.720]   to one or two drinks per week, maximum.
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:49.860]   So those are the major don'ts.
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.620]   Really avoid excessive stress.
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:53.640]   And I should mention excessive stress is not
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:55.860]   just best avoided by getting enough quality sleep at night,
[02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:57.580]   although that is the primary way.
[02:40:57.580 --> 02:40:58.840]   There are other ways to avoid stress.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:00.300]   We've done entire episodes about this,
[02:41:00.300 --> 02:41:02.520]   and we have a toolkit related to reducing stress
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:04.180]   with very simple zero cost tools.
[02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:06.340]   Again, you can find all that at HubermanLab.com.
[02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:08.340]   And I should mention if you want to find any episode
[02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:13.300]   or topic or timestamp, that website is keyword search
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:15.700]   available, so you can just go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:18.000]   put into the search function, stress tools,
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.860]   and a bunch of different links will pop up
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:22.040]   related to those topics.
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:23.940]   Likewise with sleep, likewise with any number
[02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:25.580]   of different topics you might be interested in.
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:29.000]   So get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.680]   and also directly buffer stress with real-time tools
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:34.880]   to buffer stress that I've talked about in the episodes
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:35.760]   that you can access.
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:39.240]   And there are ways to greatly reduce your overall level
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:41.880]   of stress to limit any cortisol that's released
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:44.680]   to early in the day, which is when you want cortisol released
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:46.920]   and not have it late in the day and so on and so forth.
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:48.260]   So reduce your stress.
[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:53.020]   And as I just told you, by all means,
[02:41:53.020 --> 02:41:55.320]   do not drink more than two drinks per week
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:56.800]   and zero is better than two.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:59.960]   If anyone tells you, oh, there's all this resveratrol
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:01.980]   in red wine and that's good for us,
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:03.680]   the data simply tell us that there's not enough
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:05.400]   resveratrol in red wine to really have
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:06.520]   any positive health benefit.
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:09.920]   The data around resveratrol and health benefits itself
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:11.360]   is under question nowadays.
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:14.200]   Zero alcohol is better than any alcohol.
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:15.880]   Two drinks per week is the limit.
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:20.880]   Also limit or eliminate or avoid nicotine
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:24.200]   and ideally cannabis smoking and vaping at the time
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:26.520]   in which you are trying to get pregnant.
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:28.000]   And certainly if you are pregnant,
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.240]   avoid all of the things as best you can
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:32.280]   that I just described a moment ago.
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:33.520]   Now there are a couple other don'ts
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:34.840]   that are really important.
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:37.720]   One of the most important don'ts relates to STIs
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:39.860]   or sexually transmitted infections.
[02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:42.420]   Everyone who's sexually active should get an STI check.
[02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:44.640]   In fact, if you go to a fertility clinic
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.180]   or you go for sperm analysis or you go for egg analysis,
[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:49.960]   almost always they will do an STI check
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.380]   even if you happen to be in a monogamous relationship,
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:54.220]   even if you happen to be not sexually active
[02:42:54.220 --> 02:42:56.040]   and you're somebody who's seeking to use IVF
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:58.140]   with a sperm donor or something of that sort,
[02:42:58.140 --> 02:42:59.040]   why would they do that?
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:00.860]   Why is there so much concern about that?
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:03.900]   Is it about avoiding giving birth to a child
[02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:08.440]   that has something like a herpes infection or HIV?
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:09.780]   Well, certainly that's one reason,
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:11.160]   but that's a down the line reason
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:12.980]   because at the time when someone goes into the clinic
[02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:15.340]   for one of these sperm or egg analyses,
[02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:18.240]   I mean, that's well in advance of any pregnancy, right?
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:20.840]   The reason is there are a number of STIs
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:24.280]   in particular chlamydia for which it greatly increases
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:25.840]   the probability of miscarriage.
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:28.920]   So chlamydia is one of those very insidious
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:31.360]   and cryptic STIs because a lot of people,
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:33.140]   both males and females don't even realize
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:37.040]   that they have chlamydia and then they can carry chlamydia
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:38.340]   at the time in which they conceive
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:40.120]   and then that can lead to ectopic pregnancies
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:41.560]   and or miscarriages.
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:44.040]   So by all means, get an STI check
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:46.560]   if you are somebody who's seeking to conceive children
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.440]   or evaluating your fertility generally.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:51.940]   Chlamydia can also have damaging effects on the epididymis
[02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:55.200]   and on the various other aspects of male reproductive health.
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:56.500]   In the future, we will do an episode
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:43:57.560]   all about sexual health.
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:00.280]   This is not the time for that, but get an STI check
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:02.700]   if your goal is to conceive a healthy child.
[02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:05.200]   Now, the other thing that can have a very negative impact
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.240]   on fertility and healthy pregnancy is a viral infection.
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:13.880]   For instance, if a male has had a severe viral illness,
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:15.720]   and this could be any number of different viral illnesses
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:18.140]   from flu to cold or any number of different viruses,
[02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:23.060]   pick your favorite virus, in the previous 70 to 90 days,
[02:44:23.060 --> 02:44:25.100]   that can greatly diminish the number
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:28.040]   and or quality of sperm, okay?
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:29.400]   So that's really important.
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:30.720]   This is also important if you're going to go in
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:33.380]   and do a sperm analysis and you had a viral infection
[02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:35.480]   in the previous 70 to 90 days,
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:37.100]   well, then you need to be aware of that
[02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:39.060]   because it could greatly impact the parameters
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:40.460]   of that sperm analysis.
[02:44:40.460 --> 02:44:42.960]   Likewise, for women, if you've had a serious viral infection
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:43.960]   in the previous 30 days,
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:45.420]   does that mean you should not try and conceive?
[02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:49.380]   Not necessarily, but you should talk to your OBGYN about that.
[02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:52.520]   There are data showing that viral infection,
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:54.680]   in particular of influenza in the mother,
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:58.440]   in the first trimester of pregnancy, has some correlation.
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.860]   It's not 100%, but some correlation
[02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:02.520]   with negative mental health outcomes
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:05.400]   of the offspring sometime later, including schizophrenia.
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:07.320]   This is some of the work that was done at Caltech
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:11.280]   a number of years ago and other laboratories as well.
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:13.740]   Those data are still being built up over time.
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:16.640]   Again, it's not one for one, it's not causal.
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:19.320]   So if you did get an influenza or a cold
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:21.560]   or other kind of viral infection during the first trimester
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:24.460]   or any trimester of pregnancy, I don't want to cause alarm,
[02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:26.980]   but you should talk to your OBGYN about this.
[02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:28.920]   The goal of course is to avoid viral illness
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:30.280]   at any time when you're trying to conceive
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:32.680]   or have a healthy pregnancy.
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:34.720]   But of course, sometimes people will get ill
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:37.500]   and the children can turn out to be perfectly normal
[02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:39.720]   and fine, but it is something that you want to avoid
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:42.300]   and it will impact your egg analysis
[02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:44.480]   and it will impact sperm analysis.
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:45.960]   And one thing I found really surprising
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:50.960]   in researching this episode was that one in 25 men
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:55.600]   carry a copy of a mutation for cystic fibrosis.
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:58.520]   Now, some of you are probably familiar with cystic fibrosis
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:01.460]   as a condition that can cause issues with the lungs,
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:04.680]   the accumulation of fluid in the lungs or other tissues.
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:07.440]   Cystic fibrosis, in order to express that way
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:09.220]   of accumulation of fluid in the lungs,
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.640]   you really need two copies, right?
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:12.640]   You need two mutant copies
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:15.460]   or you need two copies of the cystic fibrosis gene.
[02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:19.220]   One in 25 men will carry just one copy
[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:22.960]   and therefore will not have any symptoms of cystic fibrosis,
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:27.160]   but those one in 25 men will have defects
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:30.080]   in the architecture of the vas deferens,
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.740]   the duct through which the ejaculate needs to pass
[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:37.420]   in order to eventually be ejaculated out of the urethra.
[02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:40.400]   And so what that means is that these men can have
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:42.240]   what appears to be normal semen volume,
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:45.580]   but that they won't have normal numbers of sperm.
[02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:48.540]   And that's not because of a deficit in making the sperm,
[02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:49.920]   the testes can function just fine,
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:52.320]   the brain and the pituitary communicating
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:53.640]   with the testes just fine,
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:56.780]   but that literally the passageway by which those sperm arrive
[02:46:56.780 --> 02:46:59.480]   within the seminal fluid and are eventually ejaculated
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:01.680]   is disrupted by the cystic fibrosis gene.
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:04.060]   Luckily, if somebody has just one copy
[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:05.960]   of the cystic fibrosis gene and they're male,
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:07.040]   and this is the issue,
[02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:11.100]   the vas deferens either can be repaired
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:14.100]   by a urologist who's expert
[02:47:14.100 --> 02:47:15.740]   in the surgical repair of vas deferens,
[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:18.580]   or sperm can be extracted from the testicle directly,
[02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:20.420]   which might sound like a painful procedure,
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:22.180]   but I believe nowadays,
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:24.060]   in talking with various experts on this,
[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:26.860]   turns out that it can be done with a minimum of discomfort.
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:29.240]   And certainly if the goal is to have a healthy child,
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:30.420]   you're going to need those sperm,
[02:47:30.420 --> 02:47:32.540]   so you're going to want to get them one way or the other,
[02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:34.200]   regardless of the discomfort.
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:35.800]   Now, before getting into some of the things
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:37.500]   that you can do in the positive sense
[02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:38.800]   to increase your fertility,
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:40.740]   we do need to touch on just a few other things
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:42.240]   that you want to avoid in order
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:44.500]   to avoid diminishing your fertility.
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:46.020]   And this mainly relates to males,
[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:48.580]   but it will also be relevant to females.
[02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:50.700]   And of course, when I say also relevant to females,
[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:53.660]   I'm referring to the fact that if it's a woman and a man
[02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:55.540]   who are trying to conceive,
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:57.680]   then she of course is going to be interested
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:59.840]   in her egg quality, but also the sperm quality.
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:01.460]   And of course, there are women who are conceiving
[02:48:01.460 --> 02:48:05.700]   by way of sperm donor through IVF or IUI or otherwise,
[02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:10.700]   but in any case, the need to understand and maximize
[02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:13.360]   the quality of both the egg and the sperm is paramount.
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.660]   So in order for men to maximize the quality of their sperm,
[02:48:16.660 --> 02:48:17.800]   as I mentioned earlier,
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:19.400]   does not seem to be a big difference
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:21.200]   whether or not they use boxers or briefs
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.620]   or whether or not they quote unquote go commando.
[02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:26.060]   They don't wear any boxers or briefs of any kind.
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:30.580]   However, it is important to keep the testicles cool enough.
[02:48:30.580 --> 02:48:32.540]   They need to be about two degrees cooler
[02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:33.780]   than the rest of the body.
[02:48:33.780 --> 02:48:36.300]   And there are a number of different ways to do that.
[02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:38.960]   As I mentioned before, avoid going in hot tubs
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:40.420]   during the period in which you're trying
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:42.660]   to conceive children.
[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:45.340]   You should also avoid going in saunas during the period
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:46.700]   in which you were trying to conceive children.
[02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:48.160]   And if you do go in the sauna,
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:49.640]   you can bring an ice pack there
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:52.040]   and you can put it on the testicles
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:55.060]   in order to offset the heat of the sauna
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:57.620]   and keep the testicles cool while in the sauna.
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:00.580]   The other thing that you'll definitely want to do
[02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:03.620]   is avoid putting a laptop or any other hot device
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:04.860]   directly onto your lap.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:08.380]   There are a number of different devices
[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:09.380]   that you can put on your lap.
[02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:11.680]   You could put books or a box or there are these devices
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:14.780]   that are designed to dispel the heat from the laptop.
[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:16.180]   I would say if you're trying to conceive,
[02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:18.100]   just keep the laptop off of your lap,
[02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:20.020]   just put it on a table or standing desk or whatever,
[02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:22.260]   just keep it off of your lap.
[02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:24.540]   Also, there are some really interesting data showing
[02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:27.420]   that the amount of time that men spent sitting,
[02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:30.700]   regardless of whether or not they sit with their ankle
[02:49:30.700 --> 02:49:33.700]   on their opposite knee or with knees spread,
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:35.660]   the classic man spread stance
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:38.600]   or any other kind of seated stance
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:42.020]   is going to increase the temperature of the scrotum
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:43.820]   for reasons that are somewhat obvious.
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:45.380]   If you think about the architecture of all this,
[02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:47.180]   I think both men and women, if you put enough thought to it,
[02:49:47.180 --> 02:49:49.340]   you go, oh yeah, that would increase the temperature.
[02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:53.320]   Obviously avoid seat heaters in cars or otherwise,
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:57.260]   but reducing the total amount of time that you spend seated
[02:49:57.260 --> 02:49:59.560]   is really important if you want to keep
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.020]   the temperature milieu of the scrotum optimal
[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:04.500]   for sperm quality and fertilization.
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:05.540]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:07.420]   it's going to be important to make sure
[02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:09.920]   that your legs are not really big to the point
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:14.500]   where they are creating a hotter than is healthy environment
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:16.220]   for the scrotum and testicles.
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:19.460]   So a hotter than normal environment for the testicles
[02:50:19.460 --> 02:50:21.900]   can be caused by legs that are very large,
[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:24.920]   upper thighs that are very large due to obesity
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:27.800]   or due to those upper thighs being too muscular.
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:29.420]   So by all means, don't skip leg day,
[02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:30.540]   but be aware that if you're somebody
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.280]   who's trying to conceive, you want to do whatever you can
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:36.100]   to reduce the temperature of the scrotum,
[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:40.000]   or at least not let it get too hot for too long, okay?
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:43.720]   So I can think of all sorts of reasons now
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:44.960]   that men are going to come up with
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:48.640]   to do the man spread stance of their knees really far apart,
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:50.500]   even further if they have large legs.
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:52.060]   That's not a discussion we want to have here,
[02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:53.940]   and that's not really what today's discussion is about.
[02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:55.580]   Really the principle is what's most important,
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:59.420]   which is to keep the temperature of the scrotum and testicles
[02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:01.320]   lower than the rest of your body.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:04.200]   There's a direct blood flow from the body to the testicle
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:05.220]   that provides blood flow.
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:09.700]   It's designed in a way that that blood pathway
[02:51:09.700 --> 02:51:11.260]   should be outside the body
[02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:13.860]   and as far away from the body as possible
[02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:15.600]   in order to get the temperature milieu
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:17.060]   of the scrotum and testicle correct
[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:19.020]   for healthy sperm quality.
[02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:21.500]   Now, a topic that is sure to be a bit controversial,
[02:51:21.500 --> 02:51:22.340]   but it really shouldn't be
[02:51:22.340 --> 02:51:25.820]   because the data, at least to me, are very clear
[02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:29.900]   is this issue of phone use and sperm quality.
[02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:33.720]   Now, this can open up a whole array of issues
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:35.480]   related to things like EMFs,
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:37.460]   and you've got people out there that have, you know,
[02:51:37.460 --> 02:51:40.260]   ideas about 5G and all of this stuff.
[02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:42.100]   That is not what this discussion is about.
[02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:44.180]   The discussion I'm about to have with you
[02:51:44.180 --> 02:51:47.100]   relates to the fact that the electromagnetic fields
[02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:51.060]   and the heat-related effects of smartphones
[02:51:51.060 --> 02:51:54.540]   can indeed have a detrimental effect on sperm quality
[02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:57.600]   and yes, indeed, on testosterone levels as well.
[02:51:57.600 --> 02:51:59.280]   I'm going to refer you to a paper.
[02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:00.780]   We will link it in the show note captions.
[02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:01.620]   The title of this paper
[02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:05.100]   is "Effects of Mobile Phone Usage on Sperm Quality."
[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:07.680]   No time-dependent relationship on usage,
[02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:10.100]   a systematic review and updated meta-analysis.
[02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:13.260]   This is a paper that came out in 2021
[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:14.940]   and talks about the fact
[02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.980]   that phones emit a radiofrequency electromagnetic waves,
[02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:21.060]   which are called RF, radiofrequency, EMW,
[02:52:21.060 --> 02:52:22.580]   so electromagnetic waves,
[02:52:22.580 --> 02:52:26.660]   at a low level between 80 and 2,200 megahertz
[02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:28.260]   that can be absorbed by the human body.
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:30.500]   We know this, okay, this is not controversial,
[02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:32.620]   and have potential adverse effects on brain, heart,
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:34.180]   endocrine system, and reproductive function.
[02:52:34.180 --> 02:52:36.140]   That has been established.
[02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:39.220]   Keep in mind, there is basically no controversy
[02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:41.500]   that radiofrequency waves and EMFs
[02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:43.660]   can have a negative impact on biological tissues.
[02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:47.860]   The question is how intense are those radiofrequency waves
[02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:51.180]   and EMFs, and how detrimental are those
[02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:53.140]   on those biological tissues, okay?
[02:52:53.140 --> 02:52:54.760]   It's a matter of degrees,
[02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:56.360]   but there is very little controversy
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:57.720]   as to whether or not they have an effect
[02:52:57.720 --> 02:52:58.740]   on biological tissues,
[02:52:58.740 --> 02:53:01.020]   and I'm aware of absolutely zero data
[02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:02.420]   showing that they can have a positive effect
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:03.860]   on biological tissues.
[02:53:03.860 --> 02:53:06.480]   Since what we're mainly talking about now are smartphones,
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:08.900]   we want to separate out the heat effects of smartphones
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:10.700]   from the EMFs related to the fact
[02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:12.740]   that they are Wi-Fi smartphones,
[02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:16.500]   or they're using cellular towers and Wi-Fi,
[02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:18.140]   one or the other combination, okay?
[02:53:18.140 --> 02:53:20.140]   So there are a number of different things in the phone
[02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:21.160]   that could be detrimental.
[02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:22.120]   We need to separate those out.
[02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:22.960]   Why?
[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:24.280]   Well, because you might have heard
[02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:25.700]   that carrying your phone in your pocket
[02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:28.540]   can reduce your testosterone levels and sperm count,
[02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:29.560]   and guess what?
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:31.060]   That is true.
[02:53:31.060 --> 02:53:33.220]   The data contained within this meta-analyses
[02:53:33.220 --> 02:53:35.640]   and other meta-analyses clearly point out
[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:37.940]   that it can reduce sperm count
[02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:40.100]   and maybe testosterone levels significantly,
[02:53:40.100 --> 02:53:43.120]   but certainly sperm count and motility significantly.
[02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:44.880]   It reduces sperm quality.
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:48.580]   So should you avoid putting your phone in your pocket?
[02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:51.140]   Certainly your front pocket, I would suggest yes, right?
[02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:53.800]   If you are somebody who is seeking to conceive, right?
[02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:56.500]   I'm not somebody who is going to stop using my smartphone.
[02:53:56.500 --> 02:53:57.340]   I don't expect anyone's
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:58.440]   going to stop using their smartphone.
[02:53:58.440 --> 02:53:59.520]   The question is,
[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:02.560]   should you carry it in your front pocket if you're a male?
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:04.100]   I think to be on the safe side,
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:06.120]   the answer is probably avoid doing that.
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:08.920]   Too much of the time, ideally, don't do it at all.
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:13.080]   Then people will say, well, what if I turn off the Wi-Fi
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:15.640]   or I turn off the cellular access,
[02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:16.940]   then is it still a problem?
[02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:19.940]   Well, it's a problem due to the heat-related effects.
[02:54:19.940 --> 02:54:20.940]   And then people say,
[02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:22.580]   well, I don't actually feel the heat of the phone.
[02:54:22.580 --> 02:54:24.160]   It doesn't get that warm.
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:28.780]   But the temperature effects of the phone, it turns out,
[02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:30.940]   are enough even under conditions
[02:54:30.940 --> 02:54:33.980]   in which people don't report it to be uncomfortably warm
[02:54:33.980 --> 02:54:36.520]   that it can change the temperature milieu of the testicle
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:38.100]   in ways that can diminish sperm quality.
[02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:40.780]   How much and how that relates to fertility
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:42.280]   and healthy pregnancy, not clear,
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:44.760]   but since we're talking about things to avoid
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:48.340]   if your goal is to have a healthy fertilization
[02:54:48.340 --> 02:54:50.240]   in pregnancy, well, then by all means,
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:51.800]   just don't carry it in your front pocket.
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:53.240]   Then people say, well, what about back pocket
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:54.280]   or what about backpack?
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:57.720]   Look, it's very clear that avoiding being too close
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:01.040]   to the phone is probably better for your sperm quality
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:04.220]   than putting the phone very close to your testicles
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:06.040]   or anywhere else on your body.
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:07.940]   But it's also the reality that most people
[02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:10.280]   are going to carry a phone nowadays, all right?
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:11.180]   It's just the reality.
[02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:14.040]   I think the current estimates,
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:15.020]   and it's discussed in this paper,
[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:19.920]   that 90% of the human population has a smartphone, 90%,
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:22.400]   which is incredible, the adult population, of course,
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.180]   although a lot of kids have them as well.
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:25.980]   So this paper goes on to detail a number
[02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:27.980]   of different studies and outcomes from studies,
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:30.060]   but basically what they find, and here I'm paraphrasing,
[02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:33.820]   is that the data indicate that sperm quality declines
[02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:35.460]   when people start using a mobile phone.
[02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:37.200]   So from the point they start using a mobile phone,
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:39.340]   regardless of the usage time, this is important.
[02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:41.120]   It used to be thought that it was four hours a day
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:45.120]   or more of holding your phone or having that phone close
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:46.980]   to your body was going to diminish sperm quality.
[02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:48.980]   It turns out that it's not related to usage time.
[02:55:48.980 --> 02:55:50.540]   That's even the title of the paper.
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:52.700]   It's just the fact that people are using mobile phones
[02:55:52.700 --> 02:55:55.740]   is reducing sperm count and quality.
[02:55:55.740 --> 02:55:56.580]   That's the reality.
[02:55:56.580 --> 02:55:59.620]   Is it entirely responsible for all the reductions
[02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:01.420]   in sperm quality and maybe even the reductions
[02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:03.180]   in testosterone levels that we're observing
[02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:05.460]   from decade to decade going forward?
[02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:06.660]   I doubt that's the case.
[02:56:06.660 --> 02:56:09.200]   Is it likely to be one of the major players?
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:12.260]   I've got my bet on the fact that it is
[02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:14.020]   based on the data that I've observed.
[02:56:14.020 --> 02:56:16.140]   And so if any of you would like to peruse the data
[02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:17.980]   in this meta analysis, they're quite good.
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:22.460]   This study looked at 18 studies that include 4,280 samples.
[02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:25.020]   They were able to separate out the radio frequency
[02:56:25.020 --> 02:56:28.060]   versus the heat effects, and they were able to eliminate
[02:56:28.060 --> 02:56:31.540]   this time of usage variable that previously we thought
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:35.500]   if you were exposed to a lot of cell phone contact,
[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:37.060]   that it was far worse than if you were exposed
[02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:37.900]   to a little bit.
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:39.220]   If you're exposed to any at all,
[02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:40.600]   you're going to diminish sperm quality.
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:41.560]   What does that mean?
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:42.960]   Does that mean that no matter what you do,
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:44.320]   if you own a smartphone,
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:46.060]   that you're going to diminish sperm quality?
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:47.620]   I think the short answer is yes,
[02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:49.560]   but that you can mitigate it.
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:50.400]   What might you do?
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:52.740]   Well, keeping your phone away from your groin
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:54.180]   or as far from your groin as possible
[02:56:54.180 --> 02:56:55.800]   if you're a male who's wishing to conceive
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:56:57.100]   and maybe even a male who's wishing
[02:56:57.100 --> 02:56:59.180]   to maximize his testosterone levels,
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:01.900]   because it does appear that radio frequency waves
[02:57:01.900 --> 02:57:03.280]   and the heat from the phone,
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:06.040]   so both of those factors independently and together,
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:08.940]   of course, can disrupt the lytic cells of the testes
[02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:10.520]   and the production of testosterone
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:12.680]   and intertesticular testosterone
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:14.500]   is important for sperm production.
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:17.320]   The exact biological variables leading to all these changes
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:20.320]   isn't exactly clear, but if you're like me, you say, okay,
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:23.820]   probably not a problem for most males to carry their phone,
[02:57:23.820 --> 02:57:26.660]   but probably best to not carry it in the front pocket,
[02:57:26.660 --> 02:57:28.900]   maybe even avoid carrying the back pocket as well.
[02:57:28.900 --> 02:57:29.720]   Again, in the future,
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:31.820]   we will have an episode all about Bluetooth.
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:34.720]   We'll talk about various aspects of EMFs.
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:37.000]   It's a super interesting data set,
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.140]   and it's a data set for which there's a ton of controversy.
[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:42.320]   It's really interesting, however,
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:43.660]   and there are more and more quality data
[02:57:43.660 --> 02:57:44.740]   coming out all the time.
[02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:45.740]   And I think going forward,
[02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:47.380]   we are going to see that indeed
[02:57:47.380 --> 02:57:49.100]   there are some negative effects of smartphones
[02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:52.400]   related to both the radio frequency transmission
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:55.620]   and the fact that they generate heat.
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:58.700]   And in general, heat is not good for biological tissues.
[02:57:58.700 --> 02:58:00.680]   So any discussion about heat and sperm
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:02.480]   and how heat is detrimental to sperm
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:06.040]   has to raise this issue of whether or not cold
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:07.360]   is good for the testicle.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.620]   Okay, well, now there's a lot of data starting to come out
[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:12.360]   about the positive effects,
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:16.820]   the positive biological effects of deliberate cold exposure
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:19.840]   on different aspects of brain biology,
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:22.060]   such as the release of dopamine and norepinephrine
[02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:25.380]   and on the biology of the body, to some extent metabolism,
[02:58:25.380 --> 02:58:27.740]   but more so the impact on brown fat stores,
[02:58:27.740 --> 02:58:30.680]   which are good for us, so-called brown fat thermogenesis.
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:33.360]   There's a lot related to deliberate cold exposure.
[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:36.000]   And we've done entire episodes on deliberate cold exposure.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:37.860]   Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:39.980]   We did a guest episode with an expert
[02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:42.620]   on the use of cold for health and performance
[02:58:42.620 --> 02:58:43.640]   with my colleague, Craig Heller,
[02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:45.300]   from Stanford Department of Biology.
[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:48.860]   We also have a toolkit on how to apply deliberate
[02:58:48.860 --> 02:58:52.340]   cold exposure for health for both females and for males,
[02:58:52.340 --> 02:58:54.100]   for sports performance, cognitive performance,
[02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:55.380]   mood, sleep, et cetera.
[02:58:55.380 --> 02:58:57.260]   You can find all that, again, hubermanlab.com,
[02:58:57.260 --> 02:58:59.060]   totally zero cost.
[02:58:59.060 --> 02:59:01.380]   Just go into the menu, go to newsletter and scroll down
[02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:02.480]   and you'll find those.
[02:59:03.380 --> 02:59:06.240]   When thinking about sperm quality,
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:08.980]   we want to remember that excessive heat is bad.
[02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:11.740]   Now, does that mean that deliberate cold is good?
[02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:14.700]   Well, it turns out that one of the major causes
[02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:19.700]   of lowered sperm count and overall reduced sperm quality,
[02:59:19.700 --> 02:59:21.700]   that's quite common, is the presence
[02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:22.860]   of what's called a varicell.
[02:59:22.860 --> 02:59:25.340]   A varicell is kind of like varicose veins
[02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:28.700]   of the veins that innervate the testicle.
[02:59:28.700 --> 02:59:32.100]   And what it essentially does is it means
[02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:36.180]   that blood will pool in the testicular region.
[02:59:36.180 --> 02:59:38.480]   It can't circulate back to the body quickly enough
[02:59:38.480 --> 02:59:40.700]   and therefore the temperature of that environment increases.
[02:59:40.700 --> 02:59:42.640]   There's some other things that varicells do,
[02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:44.660]   which can be obstructive at the physical level,
[02:59:44.660 --> 02:59:46.760]   so they're not just temperature related.
[02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:50.460]   It's pretty clear that using deliberate cold exposure
[02:59:50.460 --> 02:59:53.100]   can be healthy for the sperm because of the ways,
[02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:56.660]   not that cold directly supports testosterone
[02:59:56.660 --> 03:00:00.860]   or sperm quality, but rather because cold reduces heat.
[03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:04.440]   Okay, so you will find available online,
[03:00:04.440 --> 03:00:07.260]   I think they're actually called, forgive me,
[03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:08.220]   but that's what they're called.
[03:00:08.220 --> 03:00:09.580]   I didn't name them, called Snowballs.
[03:00:09.580 --> 03:00:14.520]   These are, they're sort of like gel pack cold briefs
[03:00:14.520 --> 03:00:17.580]   that you can buy and men will wear for some period of time.
[03:00:17.580 --> 03:00:18.820]   I don't think you wear them all day.
[03:00:18.820 --> 03:00:20.940]   You wear them for some period of time.
[03:00:20.940 --> 03:00:23.980]   A lot of people are now using cold showers and ice baths
[03:00:23.980 --> 03:00:26.340]   and circulating cold baths or going into a cold ocean
[03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:28.660]   or lake for any number of different reasons
[03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:29.480]   I talked about earlier.
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:33.160]   I myself start every day with either a one to three minute
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:36.480]   cold shower or one to three minute immersion up to my neck
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:40.780]   in a cold bath, cold water, circulating water
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:41.920]   or a cold shower.
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:43.620]   I do that mainly for the psychological effects
[03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:45.380]   related to the long lasting increases
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:47.140]   in dopamine and epinephrine.
[03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:48.640]   But there are other data starting to come out
[03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:52.500]   showing that that sort of approach or similar approaches
[03:00:52.500 --> 03:00:55.400]   can increase testosterone levels and maybe even sperm counts
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:57.160]   can reduce cortisol late in the evening
[03:00:57.160 --> 03:00:58.920]   if the cold exposure is done early in the day,
[03:00:58.920 --> 03:00:59.760]   so on and so forth.
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:01.520]   So a lot of interesting data coming out
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:04.660]   in really good journals that are peer reviewed
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:06.760]   and so on in humans.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.980]   I should mention those studies are done in humans
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:10.940]   to support the use of deliberate cold exposure.
[03:01:10.940 --> 03:01:12.920]   But again, if you're going to use deliberate cold exposure
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:15.260]   to improve sperm quality, can it work?
[03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:16.680]   Yes, indeed it can work.
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:19.120]   Either indirectly by increasing testosterone
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:21.220]   or directly by improving sperm quality.
[03:01:21.220 --> 03:01:23.840]   But both of those effects are likely to be indirect
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:26.700]   by virtue of reducing the temperature of the testicle
[03:01:26.700 --> 03:01:29.880]   overall, not because there's any sort of magic effect
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:31.460]   of cold on the testicle.
[03:01:31.460 --> 03:01:32.900]   Now I have to imagine that a number of you,
[03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:35.520]   in particular, the females listening to this,
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:38.480]   are going to say, is deliberate cold exposure,
[03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:40.300]   and for that matter, is deliberate heat exposure
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:43.600]   like sauna or hot tub, good or bad for the ovary,
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:45.120]   for eggs and for fertility?
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:49.440]   Now there are fewer data to look to, unfortunately,
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:52.400]   but what we do know is that deliberate cold exposure
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:54.020]   done in the way that I just described
[03:01:54.020 --> 03:01:56.380]   one to three minutes a day, ideally early in the day
[03:01:56.380 --> 03:01:58.480]   through cold shower or immersion up to the neck,
[03:01:58.480 --> 03:01:59.440]   doesn't have to be an ice bath,
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:01.400]   could be cold circulating water
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:03.520]   or even non-circulating cold water.
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:05.120]   And people will say, well, how cold?
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:08.200]   I should have mentioned that before, how cold?
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:09.880]   There is no way I can tell you
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:11.400]   exactly how cold the water should be
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:13.760]   because for some people, 60 degrees Fahrenheit
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:15.140]   will be exceedingly cold.
[03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:17.520]   For other people, 40 degrees is going to be more appropriate.
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:18.920]   How cold should you make it?
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:20.920]   If you're going to embrace these practices,
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:23.120]   you want to, according to the literature,
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:25.720]   what you want to do is make it uncomfortably cold
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:28.260]   such that you really want to get out, but safe, right?
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:31.240]   You don't want to go into 30 degree water immediately.
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:33.560]   You can actually have a heart attack and die if you do that.
[03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:36.880]   So you want to progress gradually into the cold.
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:38.940]   So you don't want to shock your system too much,
[03:02:38.940 --> 03:02:42.040]   although it is the adrenaline evoked by that,
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:44.420]   that quickening or shortening or elimination of the breath
[03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:45.260]   for a short period of time
[03:02:45.260 --> 03:02:47.400]   when you get into uncomfortably cold water
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:50.600]   that correlates with, or is actually the reflection of,
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:51.800]   would be more accurate to say,
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:54.620]   the release of adrenaline and then dopamine and so forth,
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:56.680]   which has been very well-documented.
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:00.120]   So uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in.
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:02.680]   And I cannot tell you an exact number
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:04.940]   that is uncomfortably cold, but safe for you.
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:06.360]   It's going to differ person by person.
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:07.280]   You want to figure that out.
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:08.580]   Just like I can't tell you how much weight
[03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:10.640]   that you should squat in order to achieve
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:13.160]   some effective resistance training for the legs.
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:15.980]   It's going to differ depending on your strength
[03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:17.600]   and your prior experience and so forth.
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:19.360]   So ease into it, be safe.
[03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:21.340]   But it does appear that both for men,
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:23.240]   for reasons I talked about a few minutes ago,
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:27.260]   and for women, that deliberate cold exposure
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:31.660]   can be beneficial for fertility and for hormone production,
[03:03:31.660 --> 03:03:33.300]   but in particular for females
[03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:36.140]   in terms of regulating cortisol and for hormone production.
[03:03:36.140 --> 03:03:38.260]   Now you might say, okay, getting into cold is stressful.
[03:03:38.260 --> 03:03:40.040]   How can that be helpful for regulating stress?
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:41.860]   Well, it turns out when you get into the cold,
[03:03:41.860 --> 03:03:44.140]   you get a big surge in adrenaline and then dopamine,
[03:03:44.140 --> 03:03:45.440]   which is very long lasting,
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:47.520]   provided that's done in the early part of the day.
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:50.100]   So I would say not too close to sleep.
[03:03:50.100 --> 03:03:51.700]   Then what you do is you restrict
[03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:55.000]   your maximum cortisol release to a period earlier in the day
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.180]   that buffers, reduces that is the likelihood
[03:03:59.180 --> 03:04:01.580]   that you would have excessive amounts of cortisol
[03:04:01.580 --> 03:04:03.720]   later in the day, which not only can disrupt sleep,
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:07.260]   but is correlated with a number of other hormonal effects
[03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:08.260]   that are not good for us
[03:04:08.260 --> 03:04:10.140]   and therefore not good for fertility.
[03:04:10.140 --> 03:04:11.920]   So here what I'm describing are positive
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:16.420]   yet indirect effects of a cold on hormone levels,
[03:04:16.420 --> 03:04:19.040]   both in males and in females.
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:21.720]   So for men, we talked about increased testosterone,
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:23.700]   improved sperm quality that was indirect, right?
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:26.100]   You're reducing the temperature of the testicle,
[03:04:26.100 --> 03:04:27.420]   but it's not that cold itself
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:29.060]   is positively impacting those things.
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:29.900]   Does that make sense?
[03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:32.440]   Heat is bad, therefore reducing temperature is good.
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:35.320]   Likewise with females, deliberate cold exposure
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:38.180]   can be good for the overall fertility process,
[03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:40.680]   not because cold is good for the ovary
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:43.000]   or being cold is good for the ovary
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.980]   or for luteinizing hormone or for follicle stimulating
[03:04:45.980 --> 03:04:47.680]   hormone or anything else like that,
[03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:50.980]   but rather that using deliberate cold exposure
[03:04:50.980 --> 03:04:53.500]   as a way to restrict stress in a deliberate way
[03:04:53.500 --> 03:04:55.680]   to a particular time of day
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:57.820]   increases the release of cortisol then
[03:04:57.820 --> 03:05:00.380]   and indirectly reduces the amount of cortisol
[03:05:00.380 --> 03:05:03.720]   that's released at other times along the 24 hour cycle.
[03:05:03.720 --> 03:05:06.340]   Okay, so these are positive yet indirect effects.
[03:05:06.340 --> 03:05:09.100]   So if you're a woman who really is interested
[03:05:09.100 --> 03:05:10.660]   in exploring deliberate cold exposure
[03:05:10.660 --> 03:05:12.780]   or who enjoys it or is already doing it
[03:05:12.780 --> 03:05:15.120]   and you're wishing to conceive, great.
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:16.900]   Explore it, do it safely of course,
[03:05:16.900 --> 03:05:18.240]   but explore it and continue to do it.
[03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:20.300]   However, if you're somebody who just hates the cold
[03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:21.740]   and doesn't want to go anywhere near it,
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:23.540]   there's no reason to think that you absolutely need it
[03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:26.020]   provided that your stress, your sleep and other factors
[03:05:26.020 --> 03:05:27.860]   are all being carried out properly.
[03:05:27.860 --> 03:05:29.100]   The next things that we'll talk about
[03:05:29.100 --> 03:05:31.920]   in terms of positive things or things that we can do
[03:05:31.920 --> 03:05:34.780]   in order to maximize fertility for both females and males
[03:05:34.780 --> 03:05:37.980]   are the things that you also generally hear about elsewhere.
[03:05:37.980 --> 03:05:40.600]   Right along with sleep and avoiding alcohol
[03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:43.100]   and avoiding nicotine and avoiding cannabis,
[03:05:43.100 --> 03:05:44.940]   avoiding excessive heat for the testicle,
[03:05:44.940 --> 03:05:49.380]   avoiding excessive stress is that you want to try
[03:05:49.380 --> 03:05:51.700]   to get enough exercise, right?
[03:05:51.700 --> 03:05:54.420]   Why would exercise have anything to do with any of this?
[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:57.500]   Well, exercise and that is both a combination
[03:05:57.500 --> 03:05:59.860]   of resistance training and cardiovascular exercise
[03:05:59.860 --> 03:06:02.340]   is going to improve the health of the mitochondria
[03:06:02.340 --> 03:06:04.340]   in particular cardiovascular exercise.
[03:06:04.340 --> 03:06:06.520]   And I realized that for you fitness experts out there,
[03:06:06.520 --> 03:06:08.120]   anytime someone says cardio,
[03:06:08.120 --> 03:06:10.340]   people kind of roll their eyes like, what is that?
[03:06:10.340 --> 03:06:12.660]   There's endurance training, there's interval training,
[03:06:12.660 --> 03:06:14.840]   there's HIIT training, there's sprints,
[03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:15.900]   there's all sorts of different things.
[03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:18.100]   Some of those overlap, some of them are separate.
[03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:19.360]   Indeed, that's the case.
[03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:21.940]   But we can use a general rule of thumb here,
[03:06:21.940 --> 03:06:25.160]   which is that for most people getting anywhere from 30
[03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:29.380]   and ideally 45 to 60 minutes of exercise per day
[03:06:29.380 --> 03:06:31.460]   for six days per week, maybe even seven,
[03:06:31.460 --> 03:06:33.260]   but most people like to take a day off
[03:06:33.260 --> 03:06:35.300]   or need to take a complete day off each week,
[03:06:35.300 --> 03:06:38.060]   six to seven days per week is going to be good
[03:06:38.060 --> 03:06:39.680]   for mitochondrial health and function.
[03:06:39.680 --> 03:06:41.240]   It's also going to impact all the other things
[03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:43.460]   like quality sleep, mood, reducing stress,
[03:06:43.460 --> 03:06:44.540]   and so on and so forth.
[03:06:44.540 --> 03:06:47.240]   So exercise we can handle pretty quickly
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:49.780]   by just saying everyone should be doing it.
[03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:51.360]   Now, when people are pregnant,
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:54.000]   they might have to of course change the amount of exercise
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:55.960]   or the type of exercise that they're doing.
[03:06:55.960 --> 03:06:57.280]   There are varying opinions on that,
[03:06:57.280 --> 03:06:59.580]   but certainly the type of exercise
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:01.900]   and the amount can vary when people are pregnant.
[03:07:01.900 --> 03:07:03.860]   But if you're seeking to conceive,
[03:07:03.860 --> 03:07:04.980]   getting enough exercise is good
[03:07:04.980 --> 03:07:06.200]   because it's good for the mitochondria.
[03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:10.480]   The mitochondria are present in that mid-region of the sperm
[03:07:10.480 --> 03:07:14.420]   and mitochondria are critical for chromosomal segregation
[03:07:14.420 --> 03:07:17.260]   and the spindle and other aspects of the formation
[03:07:17.260 --> 03:07:20.480]   of a healthy egg ovulation and fertilization in the female.
[03:07:20.480 --> 03:07:21.720]   One thing that I know a lot of people
[03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:24.720]   are interested in nowadays is so-called intermittent fasting
[03:07:24.720 --> 03:07:26.300]   or time restricted feeding.
[03:07:26.300 --> 03:07:27.140]   I mean, let's be fair.
[03:07:27.140 --> 03:07:29.060]   Everybody is restricting their feeding time
[03:07:29.060 --> 03:07:30.660]   because hopefully everybody is sleeping
[03:07:30.660 --> 03:07:32.660]   at some point in the 24 hour cycle
[03:07:32.660 --> 03:07:35.440]   and nobody's eating while they are sleeping.
[03:07:35.440 --> 03:07:37.900]   That said, many people are employing
[03:07:37.900 --> 03:07:40.640]   a so-called eight hour feeding window or a 10 hour feeding
[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:41.980]   window or a 12 hour feeding window.
[03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:44.600]   And indeed there are some data to support the idea
[03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:46.960]   that that can be a good thing for a number
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:48.740]   of different biological and health parameters.
[03:07:48.740 --> 03:07:52.740]   However, also a lot of data, especially recently,
[03:07:52.740 --> 03:07:55.940]   pointed to the fact that your overall number of calories
[03:07:55.940 --> 03:07:57.900]   and the quality of your food sources
[03:07:57.900 --> 03:07:59.900]   is going to be the most important variable.
[03:07:59.900 --> 03:08:02.660]   And some people simply find that time restricted feeding
[03:08:02.660 --> 03:08:05.200]   and intermittent fasting as it's also called
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:08.440]   is just a convenient way to ensure that your total intake
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:11.320]   of calories is not excessive for what you need.
[03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:14.160]   Now, with all that said, there is evidence
[03:08:14.160 --> 03:08:15.840]   that I've covered in a solo episode
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:17.560]   and will soon have an expert guest on,
[03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:20.680]   showing that time restricted feeding
[03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:24.360]   can have certain positive outcomes for various aspects
[03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:26.960]   of organ, cellar, and tissue health.
[03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:28.680]   Okay, this is somewhat controversial,
[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:31.080]   but there is growing evidence that by restricting
[03:08:31.080 --> 03:08:33.440]   your feeding window to say eight hours or 10 hours
[03:08:33.440 --> 03:08:36.500]   or 12 hours, that it is better than if you were to eat
[03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:39.560]   over a longer period of each 24 hour cycle.
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:42.000]   Again, the data are still incoming.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:43.940]   The reason we want to talk about time restricted feeding
[03:08:43.940 --> 03:08:46.760]   intermittent fasting is that a lot of people do use it
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:49.700]   because they find it easier to not eat at certain periods
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:52.780]   of their 24 hour cycle than to restrict calories.
[03:08:52.780 --> 03:08:56.200]   But again, keep in mind, you have to restrict calories
[03:08:56.200 --> 03:08:58.540]   if your goal is to maintain or lose weight, all right?
[03:08:58.540 --> 03:09:00.660]   A discussion that we've covered in that episode
[03:09:00.660 --> 03:09:02.600]   on intermittent fasting and in the episode
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:05.120]   with Dr. Lane Norton, and that we will cover
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:06.980]   in other episodes in the future.
[03:09:06.980 --> 03:09:10.740]   So refer to those episodes at hubermanlab.com
[03:09:10.740 --> 03:09:12.120]   if you would like to learn more
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:14.160]   about intermittent fasting per se.
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:16.020]   For sake of this conversation,
[03:09:16.020 --> 03:09:17.740]   a number of people are probably asking,
[03:09:17.740 --> 03:09:22.480]   if I restrict my feeding to a certain window each 24 hours,
[03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:24.640]   because that's what's convenient or because I'm excited
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:26.120]   about the potential positive effects
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:29.520]   of intermittent fasting, is that going to disrupt
[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:34.520]   the likelihood of fertility and thereby a healthy pregnancy.
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:37.680]   And the short answer to that is if you are a female
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:39.740]   and you are having regular menstrual cycles,
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:42.400]   that is a fairly consistent duration.
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:45.540]   So maybe it's 21 days, maybe it's 35 or anywhere in between,
[03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.440]   but it's fairly consistent from month to month
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:49.240]   and you are following intermittent fasting
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:52.400]   time restricted feeding, well then chances are pretty good
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:56.040]   that it's not disrupting your fertility
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:09:58.880]   and likelihood of fertilization in a healthy pregnancy.
[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:01.920]   Of course, during pregnancy, you need to talk to your doctor
[03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:04.380]   and make sure that you're eating in a way that's supportive
[03:10:04.380 --> 03:10:06.360]   both of you and of the developing fetus.
[03:10:06.360 --> 03:10:07.840]   That's extremely important.
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:12.120]   I am not aware of data exploring in a regimented way
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:14.180]   time restricted feeding during pregnancy, okay?
[03:10:14.180 --> 03:10:16.620]   So please, please, please, if you're pregnant,
[03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:18.520]   do not jump on a time restricted feeding
[03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:19.840]   so-called intermittent fasting diet.
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:23.640]   Talk to your OB/GYN, talk to your doctor,
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:25.800]   talk to multiple doctors for that matter
[03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:27.400]   before doing anything like that,
[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:29.360]   because of course you're now eating for two,
[03:10:29.360 --> 03:10:31.960]   or if you have twins in there, you're eating for three,
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:33.240]   and very important.
[03:10:33.240 --> 03:10:34.520]   If however, you're not yet pregnant
[03:10:34.520 --> 03:10:37.920]   and you want to be fertile, get pregnant,
[03:10:37.920 --> 03:10:42.520]   or simply maintain a fertile potential and biology,
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:44.520]   you're following intermittent fasting,
[03:10:44.520 --> 03:10:47.080]   it's going to be the regularity of those periods
[03:10:47.080 --> 03:10:48.600]   and regularity of cycle length
[03:10:48.600 --> 03:10:51.460]   that will tell you whether or not that's a good idea or not.
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:52.920]   Keeping in mind, of course,
[03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:56.200]   that if your total number of calories is too low,
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:10:57.760]   your periods will cease.
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:10:59.660]   That's a well-known effect.
[03:10:59.660 --> 03:11:02.760]   But of course, stress can also induce
[03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:05.560]   cessation of menstruation.
[03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:07.240]   And there are other factors that can induce
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:09.160]   cessation of menstruation as well.
[03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:12.080]   Some of them start with changes in the brain,
[03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:13.220]   literally in the hypothalamus,
[03:11:13.220 --> 03:11:15.040]   some of them occur in the pituitary.
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:17.520]   Many of the lifestyle factors can do that,
[03:11:17.520 --> 03:11:19.120]   but most typically it's going to be
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:21.160]   excessive caloric restriction,
[03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:23.800]   or it's going to be a caloric deficit
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:26.360]   brought on by excess physical activity.
[03:11:26.360 --> 03:11:28.320]   So even if someone's eating a lot,
[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:30.520]   if they're not eating enough
[03:11:30.520 --> 03:11:32.040]   to offset their physical activity,
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:35.320]   or they're not eating enough of in particular fats,
[03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:37.520]   the essential fatty acids and protein,
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:38.800]   but also carbohydrates,
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:40.520]   well, then menstruation can cease.
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:41.920]   And of course, if menstruation is ceasing,
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:44.100]   chances are almost with certainty
[03:11:44.100 --> 03:11:46.280]   that you're not getting regular ovulations.
[03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:48.200]   Now, in terms of males and whether or not
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:49.880]   intermittent fasting is going to disrupt
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:53.680]   spermatogenesis and testosterone production,
[03:11:53.680 --> 03:11:56.340]   there's essentially no data we can look to,
[03:11:56.340 --> 03:11:59.720]   but we can look to the general logic around the relationship
[03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:03.480]   between body fat, testosterone, and spermatogenesis.
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:05.160]   And this was something that was covered
[03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:07.160]   in a discussion I had on
[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:09.880]   optimization of hormone health for males
[03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:11.280]   that I had with Dr. Kyle Gillette,
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:13.840]   who's a medical doctor and obesity specialist.
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:15.980]   Again, you can find that episode at hubermanlab.com
[03:12:15.980 --> 03:12:19.120]   if you want to learn all about hormone optimization in males.
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:21.680]   And essentially the story is as follows.
[03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:24.640]   If a male is excessively overweight,
[03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:26.920]   he's carrying too much body fat in particular,
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:29.140]   not too much muscle, although that can be an issue too,
[03:12:29.140 --> 03:12:31.560]   but too much body fat is typically the issue.
[03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:35.600]   So, you know, more than say 20% body fat,
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:39.240]   well then losing body fat is going to be the primary goal
[03:12:39.240 --> 03:12:41.760]   for maximizing testosterone, sperm health,
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:43.840]   and spermatogenesis.
[03:12:43.840 --> 03:12:46.300]   If, however, a male is already lean,
[03:12:46.300 --> 03:12:49.820]   well then actually increasing calories
[03:12:49.820 --> 03:12:51.200]   will increase testosterone.
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:53.680]   So it's a bit of a complicated story,
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:54.840]   although not so complicated
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:12:56.220]   that none of us can understand it.
[03:12:56.220 --> 03:12:57.880]   Basically, if you're overweight,
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:12:59.120]   you should focus on losing weight
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:01.540]   in order to maximize sperm quality and health.
[03:13:01.540 --> 03:13:03.280]   If you are very lean,
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:05.880]   well then restricting your calories to the point
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:08.020]   where you are starting to lose weight
[03:13:08.020 --> 03:13:10.720]   or you're dropping even more body fat
[03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:13.760]   is unlikely to increase your testosterone further, right?
[03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:15.360]   Doesn't necessarily mean it's bad
[03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:17.560]   or that you shouldn't try and go, for instance,
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:19.320]   from 15% to 10% body fat.
[03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:20.380]   I'm not saying that that's bad
[03:13:20.380 --> 03:13:22.100]   and that will reduce your testosterone,
[03:13:22.100 --> 03:13:23.900]   but in general, if you're already very lean,
[03:13:23.900 --> 03:13:26.860]   so, you know, 10% body fat, 5% body fat,
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:28.380]   and you start restricting calories further,
[03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:30.720]   your testosterone levels will drop.
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:33.200]   So in the context of intermittent fasting,
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:34.480]   it's really not an issue of whether or not
[03:13:34.480 --> 03:13:36.600]   your feeding window is eight hours or 12 hours.
[03:13:36.600 --> 03:13:37.600]   It's really an issue of whether or not
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:38.600]   you're getting enough calories
[03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:42.640]   to offset the physical demands and activities of your life,
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:44.120]   whether or not you're on a maintenance diet
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:45.440]   to maintain your weight.
[03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:47.100]   And of course, you have to put all that in the context
[03:13:47.100 --> 03:13:49.600]   of whether or not you're overweight or lean to begin with.
[03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:51.180]   The simple thing to take away from this
[03:13:51.180 --> 03:13:54.220]   is if you're a male who's using, because you like it,
[03:13:54.220 --> 03:13:56.680]   intermittent fasting, so-called time-restricted feeding,
[03:13:56.680 --> 03:13:58.820]   and you're following an eight hour
[03:13:58.820 --> 03:14:00.880]   or maybe even a one meal per day type approach,
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:02.240]   although I don't really recommend that
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:04.500]   for a number of reasons we could talk about separately.
[03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:05.920]   If you're eating over the course of eight
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:07.920]   or 10 or 12 hours per day,
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:09.340]   because that's what works for you,
[03:14:09.340 --> 03:14:11.500]   and you are ingesting enough calories
[03:14:11.500 --> 03:14:14.260]   to maintain your weight if you're already lean,
[03:14:14.260 --> 03:14:18.600]   or you are ingesting fewer calories
[03:14:18.600 --> 03:14:20.440]   than you are burning in order to lose weight
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:22.900]   because you are already overweight
[03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:24.360]   and you want to lose body fat,
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:26.160]   you're probably optimizing for all the things
[03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:28.880]   that you need to do in order to improve sperm quality
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:30.420]   and testosterone levels.
[03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:33.040]   Now, also in that episode that I did with Dr. Kyle Gillette
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:35.160]   on optimizing hormones for males,
[03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:37.360]   we talked about testosterone replacement therapy.
[03:14:37.360 --> 03:14:40.080]   It's not a topic I want to get into in any detail right now,
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:41.800]   but I will say this.
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:44.340]   Remember earlier when we were talking about spermatogenesis
[03:14:44.340 --> 03:14:46.960]   and the fact that in order for sperm to be generated
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:50.800]   consistently every month ongoing from the time of puberty
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:54.140]   until essentially the time that a man dies,
[03:14:54.140 --> 03:14:55.100]   you need two things.
[03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:56.700]   You need testosterone production
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:58.920]   from the Leydig cells of the testes,
[03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:02.600]   and you need spermatogenesis to be supported
[03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:04.480]   by that androgen binding protein
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:07.520]   coming from the support cells from the Sertoli cells.
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:08.480]   So you need testosterone
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:10.100]   and you need androgen binding protein
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:13.420]   and you need the Leydig cells and the Sertoli cells active.
[03:15:13.420 --> 03:15:16.320]   When men take exogenous, meaning from outside the body,
[03:15:16.320 --> 03:15:19.120]   testosterone either by cream or by patch or by pellets
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:20.640]   or more typically by injection,
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:22.720]   the most typical TRT approach nowadays
[03:15:22.720 --> 03:15:23.920]   is testosterone sipinate,
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:26.320]   which is biologically identical
[03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:28.800]   to the kind of testosterone you would make.
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:30.600]   Well, because of negative feedback loops,
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:33.000]   which you also learned about earlier,
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:36.320]   the testicles themselves shut down
[03:15:36.320 --> 03:15:37.760]   their own testosterone production.
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:38.580]   Why would that be?
[03:15:38.580 --> 03:15:41.120]   Okay, so you're taking testosterone in by syringe
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:43.840]   or by patch or any other method.
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:46.540]   So the circulating testosterone and the amount that arrives
[03:15:46.540 --> 03:15:49.260]   at the testicle is going to be
[03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:51.720]   hopefully clinically appropriate, not super physiological,
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:53.720]   but it'll be somewhere in the healthy reference range,
[03:15:53.720 --> 03:15:55.440]   maybe a little bit higher.
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:15:57.320]   Nowadays, some people are going a little bit higher,
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:15:58.720]   so we're not talking about full blown
[03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:00.640]   quote unquote anabolic steroid use,
[03:16:00.640 --> 03:16:03.200]   keeping in mind, of course, that estrogen is a steroid,
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:04.020]   testosterone is a steroid,
[03:16:04.020 --> 03:16:04.920]   but when we think about steroids,
[03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:06.400]   we mean like performance enhancing drugs,
[03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:08.600]   so super physiological doses.
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:10.680]   We're talking about within physiological
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:12.480]   or near physiological ranges.
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:14.480]   So if someone's taking their testosterone in
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:16.600]   from an outside exogenous source,
[03:16:16.600 --> 03:16:19.820]   the levels of circulating testosterone
[03:16:19.820 --> 03:16:20.960]   will be sufficiently high
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:23.320]   that the pituitary will register that
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:26.280]   and will stop making luteinizing hormone
[03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:29.040]   and generally follicle stimulating hormone as well.
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:30.440]   And as a consequence,
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:34.520]   spermatogenesis is vastly reduced or eliminated.
[03:16:34.520 --> 03:16:37.840]   In other words, for men who are on TRT
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:42.120]   or who are taking testosterone from an external source,
[03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:43.840]   the number of sperm that they're going to make
[03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:45.460]   is going to be dramatically reduced.
[03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:47.360]   There are things that they can do to offset that,
[03:16:47.360 --> 03:16:50.140]   like taking HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,
[03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:52.120]   which is just kind of a mimic for luteinizing hormone
[03:16:52.120 --> 03:16:56.380]   to stimulate the testes to continue to make testosterone.
[03:16:56.380 --> 03:16:59.280]   And some men will also, or instead,
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:02.720]   take FSH to stimulate the sertoli cells
[03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:06.820]   to support spermatogenesis, excuse me,
[03:17:06.820 --> 03:17:08.180]   or both or some combination.
[03:17:08.180 --> 03:17:10.200]   Some people take clomiphene, clomid.
[03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:12.480]   There are any number of different ways to bypass
[03:17:12.480 --> 03:17:15.540]   or offset the sperm-reducing effects
[03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:17.540]   of taking exogenous testosterone.
[03:17:17.540 --> 03:17:19.320]   This is a conversation that was covered
[03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:21.880]   in a fair amount of detail in that episode with Dr. Gillette,
[03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:25.680]   but just keep in mind that if you are taking testosterone
[03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:27.360]   from an exogenous source,
[03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:30.080]   your sperm counts will dramatically be reduced
[03:17:30.080 --> 03:17:31.480]   unless you do something to offset it.
[03:17:31.480 --> 03:17:33.240]   So if you are wishing to conceive,
[03:17:33.240 --> 03:17:34.680]   you need to think about whether or not
[03:17:34.680 --> 03:17:38.280]   you're going to offset the testosterone replacement therapy
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:40.460]   or whether or not you're going to come off it entirely.
[03:17:40.460 --> 03:17:42.160]   So you'll need to talk to a urologist
[03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:44.400]   and a chronologist about that.
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:46.600]   And again, a number of these different themes
[03:17:46.600 --> 03:17:48.600]   and ways to go about tapering off TRT
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:51.120]   were covered in that episode with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:53.340]   So if you're on TRT or you're considering taking it
[03:17:53.340 --> 03:17:54.720]   and you're interested in having children,
[03:17:54.720 --> 03:17:56.480]   not just now, but at any point,
[03:17:56.480 --> 03:17:58.800]   you really want to take these things into consideration.
[03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:00.000]   Now, I do want to point out
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.320]   that for the number of you out there
[03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:03.880]   who are taking supplements,
[03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:05.880]   some of which we've talked about on this podcast,
[03:18:05.880 --> 03:18:08.280]   I've talked about on other podcasts such as Tonga Ali,
[03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:09.720]   turns out that there are a lot of men and women
[03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:12.640]   taking Tonga Ali to reduce sex hormone binding
[03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:15.340]   globulin levels to increase testosterone and estrogen,
[03:18:15.340 --> 03:18:17.160]   in some cases, libido and so forth.
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:21.100]   Those approaches, meaning supplement-based approaches
[03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:25.580]   to increase testosterone or free testosterone
[03:18:25.580 --> 03:18:29.080]   or some related hormones are not going to shut down
[03:18:29.080 --> 03:18:31.480]   your own endogenous testosterone production
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:34.040]   and reduce the number of sperm that you make.
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:35.800]   Or at least as far as we know,
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:37.520]   disrupt ovulation in any kind of way,
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:39.720]   provided that the dosages are within normal ranges.
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:43.040]   Again, supplementation to support your hormones
[03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:47.400]   should not disrupt ovulation or spermatogenesis
[03:18:47.400 --> 03:18:49.600]   or testosterone production, quite the opposite.
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:50.840]   It should enhance it.
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:52.360]   What I just described around TRT
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:54.240]   is taking exogenous testosterone
[03:18:54.240 --> 03:18:57.160]   and that itself is an entirely different beast.
[03:18:57.160 --> 03:18:58.600]   Now, with all of that said,
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:00.840]   there are some supplements out there
[03:19:00.840 --> 03:19:05.300]   that include testosterone as a ingredient
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:08.920]   that's been snuck in to various formulas
[03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:10.560]   that include blends and things of that sort.
[03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:11.580]   You want to be aware of that.
[03:19:11.580 --> 03:19:13.720]   And we did an episode about how to develop
[03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:16.080]   a rational guide to supplementation.
[03:19:16.080 --> 03:19:18.120]   I highly recommend listening to that episode.
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:19.120]   Again, it's timestamped,
[03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:22.100]   available free at hubermanlab.com in all formats,
[03:19:22.100 --> 03:19:24.480]   because it talks about which supplements
[03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:26.280]   are likely to be clean, quote unquote,
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:28.460]   to contain the things that you expect them to contain.
[03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:29.940]   There's more and more evidence coming out
[03:19:29.940 --> 03:19:33.400]   that a lot of supplements, including some, for instance,
[03:19:33.400 --> 03:19:35.320]   supplements that contain testicle
[03:19:35.320 --> 03:19:38.360]   or the extracts of testicles can contain testosterone.
[03:19:38.360 --> 03:19:39.600]   Whether or not that can shut down
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:42.300]   your own endogenous testosterone production isn't clear.
[03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:44.020]   No one's really explored that in detail,
[03:19:44.020 --> 03:19:45.920]   but based on everything we just talked about with TRT,
[03:19:45.920 --> 03:19:48.200]   it stands to reason that it might either reduce it
[03:19:48.200 --> 03:19:49.040]   or shut it down.
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:50.860]   It's just never been explored yet.
[03:19:50.860 --> 03:19:53.880]   So by all means, make sure that you know what you're taking
[03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:54.900]   if you're taking supplements.
[03:19:54.900 --> 03:19:57.060]   But again, the major point here
[03:19:57.060 --> 03:19:58.620]   is that for both females and males,
[03:19:58.620 --> 03:20:02.560]   taking supplements to support healthy hormone production,
[03:20:02.560 --> 03:20:04.800]   including things like Tonga Ali,
[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:09.100]   is not the same as taking hormones or bioidentical hormones,
[03:20:09.100 --> 03:20:10.720]   which indeed can shut down
[03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:12.940]   your own endogenous production of hormones
[03:20:12.940 --> 03:20:15.720]   and thereby reduce both egg quality
[03:20:15.720 --> 03:20:18.120]   and the chance of fertilization and healthy pregnancy
[03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:20.240]   and sperm quality and the chance of fertilization
[03:20:20.240 --> 03:20:21.480]   and healthy pregnancy.
[03:20:21.480 --> 03:20:25.680]   Anytime there's a discussion about fertility and pregnancy,
[03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:27.680]   there seems to also be a parallel discussion
[03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:29.420]   about sex determination.
[03:20:29.420 --> 03:20:31.880]   That is, what factors can influence
[03:20:31.880 --> 03:20:35.360]   whether or not the child that's born is male or female?
[03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:38.040]   That is, whether or not it has double X chromosomes,
[03:20:38.040 --> 03:20:40.700]   so one X chromosome from mom, one X chromosome from dad,
[03:20:40.700 --> 03:20:42.740]   because the egg was fertilized by a sperm
[03:20:42.740 --> 03:20:46.240]   that had an XX chromosome, that 23rd chromosome,
[03:20:46.240 --> 03:20:48.480]   or whether or not the offspring is male,
[03:20:48.480 --> 03:20:50.140]   whether or not it has the X chromosome from mom,
[03:20:50.140 --> 03:20:53.960]   because it's always going to be the X chromosome in that egg
[03:20:53.960 --> 03:20:56.000]   and a Y chromosome from the sperm
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:57.920]   that fertilized that particular egg.
[03:20:57.920 --> 03:20:59.600]   Now, of course, there are instances out there
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:04.600]   of people that have XXY chromosomes or XYY chromosomes,
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:07.880]   but the vast majority of people out there
[03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:11.260]   are going to have either an XX chromosome,
[03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:14.680]   so we call that a female karyotype, right?
[03:21:14.680 --> 03:21:16.960]   This is different than genotype and phenotype,
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:20.320]   but a female karyotype would be XX,
[03:21:20.320 --> 03:21:24.880]   or a male karyotype, which would be XY, okay?
[03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:27.280]   Now, despite the fact that it is the egg and the sperm
[03:21:27.280 --> 03:21:28.380]   and the chromosomes that they carry
[03:21:28.380 --> 03:21:30.980]   that are going to determine the chromosomes,
[03:21:30.980 --> 03:21:34.320]   there's a lot of lore and discussion about the factors
[03:21:34.320 --> 03:21:38.160]   that can bias which sperm will fertilize the egg
[03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:41.100]   and thereby whether or not you're going to get an XX female
[03:21:41.100 --> 03:21:44.620]   or an XY male chromosome and therefore offspring.
[03:21:44.620 --> 03:21:47.360]   Now, not only is the lore around this whole issue
[03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:50.100]   of sex determination rather prominent,
[03:21:50.100 --> 03:21:52.360]   but it is also somewhat unusual
[03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:53.820]   and perhaps even interesting.
[03:21:53.820 --> 03:21:57.680]   So for instance, Aristotle himself proposed
[03:21:57.680 --> 03:22:00.900]   that if a man is thinking about himself
[03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:05.320]   and his own pleasure more than his partner
[03:22:05.320 --> 03:22:08.580]   and her pleasure at the point of ejaculation,
[03:22:08.580 --> 03:22:11.160]   then the offspring will be male.
[03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:13.680]   Aristotle also asserted that if a man is thinking more
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:15.780]   about his partner and her pleasure
[03:22:15.780 --> 03:22:17.920]   at the point in which he ejaculates,
[03:22:17.920 --> 03:22:20.840]   well, then the offspring would be female.
[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:23.600]   Of course, we have zero reason to believe
[03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:26.060]   that there's any truth to Aristotle's theory.
[03:22:26.060 --> 03:22:27.960]   There are no data to support that.
[03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:30.080]   In fact, I'm not even sure how you would run that experiment
[03:22:30.080 --> 03:22:33.280]   because you can't really look at people's thoughts.
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:36.240]   You'd have to rely on honest self-report.
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:39.500]   And even if people were to faithfully report
[03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:42.200]   what they were thinking about at the moment of ejaculation,
[03:22:42.200 --> 03:22:43.240]   this would involve, of course,
[03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:44.540]   bringing people into the laboratory
[03:22:44.540 --> 03:22:47.780]   and somehow measuring or analyzing their thoughts
[03:22:47.780 --> 03:22:50.940]   or gathering their thoughts during the sexual intercourse
[03:22:50.940 --> 03:22:52.100]   at the point of ejaculation,
[03:22:52.100 --> 03:22:54.740]   then figuring out which biological sex
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:56.640]   was the offspring, et cetera.
[03:22:56.640 --> 03:22:57.900]   Just a near impossible
[03:22:57.900 --> 03:23:00.480]   and probably not the most important experiment
[03:23:00.480 --> 03:23:02.080]   to invest our time doing.
[03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:06.240]   Nonetheless, there continues to be a lot of lore
[03:23:06.240 --> 03:23:08.640]   about what determines the sex of the offspring.
[03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:11.120]   Most notably, there's a lot of lore and discussion
[03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:15.260]   and rumor about the idea that particular sexual positions
[03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:18.020]   at the point of ejaculation during intercourse
[03:23:18.020 --> 03:23:21.780]   can somehow bias the likelihood that a pregnancy
[03:23:21.780 --> 03:23:26.340]   will be either resulting in male or female offspring.
[03:23:26.340 --> 03:23:28.780]   Now, again, there are zero data to support this.
[03:23:28.780 --> 03:23:31.840]   And yet this whole notion of sex determination
[03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:33.100]   is a really interesting one
[03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:35.400]   that people seem to be somewhat obsessed by.
[03:23:35.400 --> 03:23:38.200]   So much so that, again, if you go online
[03:23:38.200 --> 03:23:41.160]   or if you were to talk to people in the sort of,
[03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:44.720]   let's call it holistic or peripheral health spaces
[03:23:44.720 --> 03:23:47.400]   related to fertility, there is discussion about,
[03:23:47.400 --> 03:23:49.260]   okay, well, you take this sexual position
[03:23:49.260 --> 03:23:50.980]   at the point of ejaculation to get a boy
[03:23:50.980 --> 03:23:52.200]   and you take that sexual position
[03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:54.000]   at the point of ejaculation to get a girl,
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.680]   or you do this in the early part of the day
[03:23:56.680 --> 03:23:58.320]   or the later part of the day.
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:01.520]   Again, all for which there is zero data
[03:24:01.520 --> 03:24:04.300]   to support any kind of systematic relationship
[03:24:04.300 --> 03:24:05.400]   between what I just discussed
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:07.440]   and the biological sex of the offspring.
[03:24:07.440 --> 03:24:11.280]   That said, there are now emerging methods
[03:24:11.280 --> 03:24:16.280]   that people are using in order to separate out the sperm
[03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:20.280]   that will indeed give rise to a male offspring
[03:24:20.280 --> 03:24:21.720]   versus a female offspring.
[03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:23.780]   Now, this of course is done in the context
[03:24:23.780 --> 03:24:25.560]   of in vitro fertilization.
[03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:27.860]   We haven't talked too much about in vitro fertilization,
[03:24:27.860 --> 03:24:31.040]   but in vitro fertilization involves, as the name suggests,
[03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:35.300]   taking an egg and taking a sperm, pairing them in a dish.
[03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:37.920]   This can be done a number of different ways,
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:41.000]   but just to briefly describe the IVF procedure,
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.660]   IVF involves administering supra,
[03:24:44.660 --> 03:24:45.940]   meaning greater than normal,
[03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:50.100]   supra physiological levels of follicle stimulating hormone
[03:24:50.100 --> 03:24:51.920]   and luteinizing hormone
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:54.560]   during the follicular phase of a woman's cycle.
[03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:58.960]   What that causes is the maturation of not just one egg
[03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:03.720]   that would be ovulated, but multiple follicles and eggs.
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:06.880]   And then ovulation itself is suppressed
[03:25:06.880 --> 03:25:10.160]   also through the administration of exogenous hormones.
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:12.560]   And then under ultrasound guidance,
[03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:16.480]   an OB/GYN goes in and collects the mature eggs and follicles,
[03:25:16.480 --> 03:25:19.120]   puts them in a dish, and then sperm are delivered
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:21.020]   to that dish, and those could either be sperm
[03:25:21.020 --> 03:25:23.860]   that were frozen previously or more typically,
[03:25:23.860 --> 03:25:27.180]   or ideally it would be live sperm collected that day
[03:25:27.180 --> 03:25:31.140]   that are washed through a very straightforward procedure.
[03:25:31.140 --> 03:25:33.640]   And then those sperm either are allowed to compete
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:35.760]   for those eggs and fertilize those eggs
[03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:39.660]   and allow them to advance to a very early embryo stage
[03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:41.160]   before those embryos are frozen
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:43.400]   and eventually implanted into a woman
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:47.300]   in order to have them be carried to full term, ideally,
[03:25:47.300 --> 03:25:51.240]   or there's a procedure in which specific sperm are selected
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:52.860]   because they have the best morphology,
[03:25:52.860 --> 03:25:56.280]   motility, and so forth, and in a process called ICSI,
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:26:01.760]   in which the sperm themselves are literally forced
[03:26:01.760 --> 03:26:03.960]   to fertilize that particular egg.
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:07.140]   Now, under those conditions,
[03:26:07.140 --> 03:26:10.960]   typically a couple or a woman,
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:13.200]   if she's doing this on her own with a sperm donor,
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:16.600]   will get multiple fertilized embryos, okay,
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:20.180]   that are carried to a multicellular stage
[03:26:20.180 --> 03:26:23.380]   so that it's clear that they could grow into a child
[03:26:23.380 --> 03:26:26.700]   if they were implanted into a viable host,
[03:26:26.700 --> 03:26:27.600]   sometimes the surrogate,
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:30.300]   sometimes the woman who wants the child herself.
[03:26:30.300 --> 03:26:31.540]   And under those conditions,
[03:26:31.540 --> 03:26:33.700]   it is possible to look at the genetic makeup,
[03:26:33.700 --> 03:26:37.780]   including the karyotype of those early nascent embryos,
[03:26:37.780 --> 03:26:40.780]   in which case people really can select the sex
[03:26:40.780 --> 03:26:41.620]   of their offspring.
[03:26:41.620 --> 03:26:45.880]   That is, they will have some embryos that are XX,
[03:26:45.880 --> 03:26:47.540]   some embryos that are XY.
[03:26:47.540 --> 03:26:50.880]   It's very likely also that they will have some embryos
[03:26:50.880 --> 03:26:54.800]   that have karyotypes or genotypes, which are not ideal,
[03:26:54.800 --> 03:26:57.260]   in that they would potentially lead to a miscarriage
[03:26:57.260 --> 03:26:58.540]   or some other genetic defect.
[03:26:58.540 --> 03:27:01.420]   And so typically people do not select
[03:27:01.420 --> 03:27:04.060]   to implant those embryos
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:06.940]   if they have the option to implant embryos
[03:27:06.940 --> 03:27:10.600]   that are of either XX or XY karyotype
[03:27:10.600 --> 03:27:13.620]   and the normal chromosomal arrangements,
[03:27:13.620 --> 03:27:15.420]   for obvious reasons.
[03:27:15.420 --> 03:27:20.180]   So the whole point here is that sex selection is possible,
[03:27:20.180 --> 03:27:23.320]   but only using in vitro fertilization.
[03:27:23.320 --> 03:27:25.660]   The other thing that is becoming clear to us
[03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:28.660]   in more recent years is that sex selection
[03:27:28.660 --> 03:27:31.060]   is actually possible at the level of the sperm
[03:27:31.060 --> 03:27:33.180]   even prior to fertilization.
[03:27:33.180 --> 03:27:35.340]   This is an emerging data set,
[03:27:35.340 --> 03:27:37.300]   and this is largely happening in clinics
[03:27:37.300 --> 03:27:38.640]   outside of the United States,
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:41.200]   but there are some clinics that have figured out methods
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:43.240]   in which they can take a sperm sample
[03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:46.840]   and they can spin that sperm sample in a centrifuge
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:49.000]   at a rate that separates out the sperm
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:50.720]   into what are called different fractions.
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:52.340]   So for those of you who've done a little bit of biology
[03:27:52.340 --> 03:27:55.280]   with centrifuges, when you spin any kind of substance
[03:27:55.280 --> 03:27:58.520]   that includes multiple things in it of different weights,
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:00.200]   when you spin them, the things of different weights
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:02.400]   segregate out into different fractions
[03:28:02.400 --> 03:28:03.560]   along the depth of the tube.
[03:28:03.560 --> 03:28:05.840]   And then you can take out one fraction or the next
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:06.820]   simply with a little pipette.
[03:28:06.820 --> 03:28:07.920]   You take out the top fraction,
[03:28:07.920 --> 03:28:09.440]   the middle fraction, and so forth.
[03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:11.320]   And what these clinics have figured out
[03:28:11.320 --> 03:28:13.580]   is that if they spin the sperm sample
[03:28:13.580 --> 03:28:16.200]   at the correct spin rate,
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:21.200]   that the sperm that will give rise to male offspring
[03:28:21.200 --> 03:28:23.640]   and the sperm that will give rise to female offspring
[03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:25.640]   segregate out into different fractions,
[03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:29.840]   allowing them to take each of those fractions separately
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:33.880]   and to apply them to eggs, if it's in vitro fertilization,
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:36.240]   and give rise very reliably,
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:37.800]   certainly much more than chance,
[03:28:37.800 --> 03:28:41.480]   to either male or female embryos.
[03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:43.880]   They also, of course, can choose to do this
[03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:46.040]   outside the context of in vitro fertilization.
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:49.200]   So some people are now opting to have their sperm samples
[03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:50.700]   spun out in this way,
[03:28:50.700 --> 03:28:52.800]   separate out the sperm that give rise
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:54.240]   to male or female offspring,
[03:28:54.240 --> 03:28:57.500]   and then to only use the fraction
[03:28:57.500 --> 03:28:58.980]   that they are interested in, right?
[03:28:58.980 --> 03:29:00.560]   So if they want a boy, they'll use one fraction.
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:02.920]   If they want a girl, they'll use different fraction.
[03:29:02.920 --> 03:29:06.280]   And then to use those fractions in the context
[03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:09.640]   of what's called IUI or intrauterine insemination,
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:11.360]   which is, as the name suggests,
[03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:14.740]   rather than having the man deliver the ejaculate
[03:29:14.740 --> 03:29:16.400]   with his penis and the sperm with his penis,
[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:18.400]   they have a device.
[03:29:18.400 --> 03:29:20.480]   The devices are now commercially sold,
[03:29:20.480 --> 03:29:21.840]   believe it or not, they're sold over the counter
[03:29:21.840 --> 03:29:24.000]   and on the internet, so people will even do this at home.
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:26.120]   And so what they're doing is they'll take the sperm
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:31.120]   and they'll do IUI in order to bias the probability
[03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:33.680]   that they're going to get a male or a female offspring.
[03:29:33.680 --> 03:29:36.340]   Again, this is something that's now emerging.
[03:29:36.340 --> 03:29:37.880]   It's not commonplace.
[03:29:37.880 --> 03:29:42.280]   Most of the time, people simply roll the dice, as it were,
[03:29:42.280 --> 03:29:45.960]   by having either intercourse and just hoping for
[03:29:45.960 --> 03:29:49.080]   or not caring if they get a male or a female offspring,
[03:29:49.080 --> 03:29:50.480]   or in the instance of IVF,
[03:29:50.480 --> 03:29:52.040]   selecting male or female offspring,
[03:29:52.040 --> 03:29:55.200]   sometimes largely on the basis of the chromosomal arrangements
[03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:59.680]   So of course, some people might prefer to have one
[03:29:59.680 --> 03:30:02.040]   or the other biological sex as their offspring,
[03:30:02.040 --> 03:30:05.120]   but of course, the healthy chromosomal arrangements
[03:30:05.120 --> 03:30:08.000]   are going to be paramount for getting a healthy child.
[03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:10.120]   And as I mentioned before,
[03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:11.600]   unhealthy chromosomal arrangements
[03:30:11.600 --> 03:30:13.280]   or abnormal chromosomal arrangements
[03:30:13.280 --> 03:30:16.480]   often lead to miscarriage and/or birth defects.
[03:30:16.480 --> 03:30:19.480]   So selecting for healthy chromosomal arrangements
[03:30:19.480 --> 03:30:20.760]   is always paramount,
[03:30:20.760 --> 03:30:22.800]   but some people are selecting for biological sex.
[03:30:22.800 --> 03:30:27.540]   And indeed, some couples who can conceive naturally
[03:30:27.540 --> 03:30:31.000]   are opting for IUI in order to be able
[03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.680]   to select biological sex because of this ability
[03:30:33.680 --> 03:30:37.000]   to spin out the sperm samples to different fractions
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:39.940]   and select the male or female sperm.
[03:30:39.940 --> 03:30:41.580]   That is the sperm that would give rise
[03:30:41.580 --> 03:30:42.860]   to a male or female offspring.
[03:30:42.860 --> 03:30:46.880]   So this is a rapidly emerging theme, believe it or not.
[03:30:46.880 --> 03:30:48.200]   Who knew?
[03:30:48.200 --> 03:30:49.600]   And of course, it has nothing to do
[03:30:49.600 --> 03:30:50.840]   with Aristotle's assertions
[03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:52.120]   about what people are thinking about
[03:30:52.120 --> 03:30:53.640]   at the point of ejaculation,
[03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:56.360]   nor does it have anything to do with body position
[03:30:56.360 --> 03:30:57.960]   at the point of ejaculation.
[03:30:57.960 --> 03:31:00.280]   But I do find it rather interesting that
[03:31:00.280 --> 03:31:01.320]   even in this day and age,
[03:31:01.320 --> 03:31:04.780]   people seem to be continually pursuing
[03:31:04.780 --> 03:31:06.600]   new and different ways to understand
[03:31:06.600 --> 03:31:08.520]   why one sperm or another sperm
[03:31:08.520 --> 03:31:11.600]   happens to fertilize the egg.
[03:31:11.600 --> 03:31:14.180]   And when that information is not available,
[03:31:14.180 --> 03:31:15.680]   because frankly, it's not available yet,
[03:31:15.680 --> 03:31:18.960]   we don't know why a sperm containing a Y chromosome
[03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:20.380]   or sperm containing an X chromosome
[03:31:20.380 --> 03:31:22.160]   is more likely to fertilize an egg.
[03:31:22.160 --> 03:31:23.580]   I mean, there's some ideas, for instance,
[03:31:23.580 --> 03:31:25.720]   that older fathers tend to have more daughters
[03:31:25.720 --> 03:31:26.940]   as opposed to sons.
[03:31:26.940 --> 03:31:29.000]   But when you really look at the data, it's pretty mixed.
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:30.760]   So if you've heard that before,
[03:31:30.760 --> 03:31:32.760]   has a particular nickname
[03:31:32.760 --> 03:31:34.560]   that I'm not going to describe on the podcast,
[03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:35.820]   you can look it up online.
[03:31:35.820 --> 03:31:39.780]   But if any of you are aware of any other kind of ideals
[03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:42.460]   or lore, no matter how ridiculous or crazy,
[03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:44.080]   please put them in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:31:44.080 --> 03:31:46.440]   I'd be very curious to learn about those,
[03:31:46.440 --> 03:31:49.420]   mostly out of interest and curiosity.
[03:31:49.420 --> 03:31:52.400]   But look, sometimes these outrageous stories,
[03:31:52.400 --> 03:31:54.580]   such as notions of body position
[03:31:54.580 --> 03:31:56.980]   and how they influence biological sex,
[03:31:56.980 --> 03:31:58.240]   even though they turn out not to be true,
[03:31:58.240 --> 03:32:00.360]   they turn out to be interesting for other reasons.
[03:32:00.360 --> 03:32:02.160]   And in fact, next, we're going to talk about
[03:32:02.160 --> 03:32:04.500]   how body position during sexual intercourse
[03:32:04.500 --> 03:32:08.660]   can in fact influence fertility and pregnancy.
[03:32:08.660 --> 03:32:11.120]   So another common theme around fertility and pregnancy
[03:32:11.120 --> 03:32:12.440]   that you'll hear about
[03:32:12.440 --> 03:32:15.260]   is that for couples that are trying to get pregnant,
[03:32:15.260 --> 03:32:16.980]   that during intercourse,
[03:32:16.980 --> 03:32:19.720]   they should do whatever it is that works for them.
[03:32:19.720 --> 03:32:23.260]   But then after the man ejaculates,
[03:32:23.260 --> 03:32:26.520]   that the woman should try and position her ankles
[03:32:26.520 --> 03:32:31.520]   above her head or somehow otherwise tilt her pelvis back
[03:32:31.520 --> 03:32:35.120]   in order to increase the rate and or probability
[03:32:35.120 --> 03:32:37.500]   that the sperm swim toward the egg,
[03:32:37.500 --> 03:32:39.480]   as opposed to the other direction.
[03:32:39.480 --> 03:32:42.440]   Now, I talked to a couple of different OBGYNs
[03:32:42.440 --> 03:32:45.460]   and urologists that are focused on fertility
[03:32:45.460 --> 03:32:46.640]   about this topic.
[03:32:46.640 --> 03:32:48.800]   And it turns out you get pretty mixed answers
[03:32:48.800 --> 03:32:51.320]   as to whether or not there's any validity to this idea
[03:32:51.320 --> 03:32:53.320]   that the woman's body position
[03:32:53.320 --> 03:32:55.900]   after the man ejaculates inside of her
[03:32:55.900 --> 03:32:58.980]   can somehow influence the probability of pregnancy.
[03:32:58.980 --> 03:33:00.660]   One group of experts told me
[03:33:00.660 --> 03:33:02.660]   that there is no reason for a woman
[03:33:02.660 --> 03:33:05.720]   to need to continue to lie down, elevate the ankles,
[03:33:05.720 --> 03:33:08.360]   or in any way tilt her pelvis back
[03:33:08.360 --> 03:33:10.380]   in order to increase the probability
[03:33:10.380 --> 03:33:12.880]   of successful fertilization.
[03:33:12.880 --> 03:33:15.120]   The other group suggested that indeed
[03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:17.920]   there is a strong reason to believe
[03:33:17.920 --> 03:33:20.320]   that tilting the pelvis back,
[03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:22.120]   maybe even keeping the ankles elevated
[03:33:22.120 --> 03:33:26.500]   and having a woman lie on her back for about 15 minutes
[03:33:26.500 --> 03:33:30.880]   with the pelvis positioned at about 20 degrees back
[03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:33.900]   is ideal for optimizing fertilization.
[03:33:33.900 --> 03:33:36.020]   I mean, they were really specific about the recommendation.
[03:33:36.020 --> 03:33:39.200]   So I find this interesting that within the cohort
[03:33:39.200 --> 03:33:43.520]   of extremely well-trained MDs, OBGYNs,
[03:33:43.520 --> 03:33:46.680]   and urology, fertility docs, and OBGYNs,
[03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:48.300]   you see a split that has nothing to do
[03:33:48.300 --> 03:33:51.840]   with whether or not the physician was male or female,
[03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:54.560]   or their training or their institution, none of that.
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:56.160]   There just seemed to be a sort of even split
[03:33:56.160 --> 03:33:57.000]   between the two.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:58.480]   Now, granted, it wasn't the largest sample size
[03:33:58.480 --> 03:33:59.400]   that I could have obtained,
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:00.880]   and yet I do find it interesting
[03:34:00.880 --> 03:34:05.160]   that there's this split in the opinion about this.
[03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:07.440]   One group, the group that said,
[03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:10.360]   "No, pelvic position doesn't really matter.
[03:34:10.360 --> 03:34:11.480]   Don't worry about it.
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:14.540]   It's not going to influence the rates of fertilization,"
[03:34:14.540 --> 03:34:17.540]   argue that the sperm swim very quickly
[03:34:17.540 --> 03:34:19.440]   and that if they are released near the cervix,
[03:34:19.440 --> 03:34:22.040]   they're going to swim very quickly toward the egg
[03:34:22.040 --> 03:34:25.880]   in order to fertilize it, regardless of pelvic position.
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:30.220]   The other group said, "Well, yes, sperm swim quickly."
[03:34:30.220 --> 03:34:33.040]   And even if they're released right at the entry
[03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:36.080]   to the cervix, that the sperm still have
[03:34:36.080 --> 03:34:37.020]   a long distance to go.
[03:34:37.020 --> 03:34:39.080]   Again, if you were to scale this,
[03:34:39.080 --> 03:34:40.320]   according to the size of the sperm
[03:34:40.320 --> 03:34:43.520]   versus the size of a human body, an entire human body,
[03:34:43.520 --> 03:34:45.600]   what you'd scale it to is the distance
[03:34:45.600 --> 03:34:47.300]   between Los Angeles and San Francisco,
[03:34:47.300 --> 03:34:50.020]   and it needs to undergo that basically within 24 hours or so,
[03:34:50.020 --> 03:34:51.440]   although, as we mentioned earlier,
[03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:54.980]   sperm can survive quite a while inside of the woman's body,
[03:34:54.980 --> 03:34:57.820]   maybe three or five days at least.
[03:34:57.820 --> 03:35:00.100]   So in both cases, they acknowledge it's a long distance,
[03:35:00.100 --> 03:35:02.400]   but on the one hand, you have a group of experts
[03:35:02.400 --> 03:35:04.780]   that are saying the sperm more or less know what to do
[03:35:04.780 --> 03:35:06.480]   and are going to do it regardless of the position
[03:35:06.480 --> 03:35:09.020]   of the woman after ejaculation inside her,
[03:35:09.020 --> 03:35:10.480]   and the other group saying,
[03:35:10.480 --> 03:35:13.120]   "No, we want to do everything we can to bias the likelihood
[03:35:13.120 --> 03:35:15.460]   that the sperm will fertilize the egg."
[03:35:15.460 --> 03:35:19.920]   Okay, well, setting aside the basic argument
[03:35:19.920 --> 03:35:24.920]   that tilting back of the pelvis and lying stationary or so
[03:35:24.920 --> 03:35:28.320]   for about 15 minutes after sexual intercourse
[03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:32.320]   and ejaculation is not an expensive endeavor,
[03:35:32.320 --> 03:35:36.280]   although it requires a little bit of time,
[03:35:36.280 --> 03:35:38.580]   and it forces people to remain motionless
[03:35:38.580 --> 03:35:40.320]   or close to motionless,
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:42.680]   and they're not up and around and moving about.
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:45.280]   Aside from that, it's a relatively low investment,
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:46.640]   so one argument is,
[03:35:46.640 --> 03:35:49.880]   "Well, if it could bias the likelihood of fertilization
[03:35:49.880 --> 03:35:52.880]   at all and people want to get pregnant,
[03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:54.580]   why wouldn't they do that?"
[03:35:54.580 --> 03:35:56.020]   Okay, so that's a reasonable argument,
[03:35:56.020 --> 03:35:58.460]   but it doesn't really point to the mechanism.
[03:35:58.460 --> 03:36:00.620]   The arguments that point to a potential mechanism
[03:36:00.620 --> 03:36:03.500]   are that if you recall what we were talking about
[03:36:03.500 --> 03:36:05.400]   when we talked about sperm quality,
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:07.620]   sperm quality involves a bunch of different measures
[03:36:07.620 --> 03:36:10.300]   like concentration of sperm per milliliter semen,
[03:36:10.300 --> 03:36:14.600]   morphology of those sperm, how many are forward motile.
[03:36:14.600 --> 03:36:18.040]   It turns out that in any one ejaculate sample,
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:21.120]   the total number of forward motile
[03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:24.520]   and yet fast forward motile sperm
[03:36:24.520 --> 03:36:28.640]   that are also of the highest quality morphology
[03:36:28.640 --> 03:36:30.280]   is actually quite low.
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:34.500]   And so the idea here is that you want to get as many sperm
[03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:36.780]   of the highest quality swimming toward the egg
[03:36:36.780 --> 03:36:39.680]   because those sperm stand the highest probability
[03:36:39.680 --> 03:36:41.400]   of fertilizing that egg.
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:42.920]   And in fact, this relates to some of the discussion
[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:46.360]   we were having earlier about behavioral do's and don'ts
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:50.560]   for sake of increasing the probability of fertilization.
[03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:53.920]   And the one that is most important here is cannabis.
[03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:55.700]   It turns out that the data on cannabis
[03:36:55.700 --> 03:36:59.040]   really do support the idea that some of you may have heard
[03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:00.880]   from parents and teachers.
[03:37:00.880 --> 03:37:03.800]   I don't know, I did hear this from parents and teachers
[03:37:03.800 --> 03:37:08.800]   that cannabis can disrupt the swimming styles of sperm
[03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:11.800]   in ways that are not supportive of fertilization,
[03:37:11.800 --> 03:37:14.080]   that it can turn more of the sperm into twitchers.
[03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:15.180]   Although when I learned about this,
[03:37:15.180 --> 03:37:16.600]   I was not informed of the word twitchers.
[03:37:16.600 --> 03:37:20.160]   What I was told is that if you use cannabis,
[03:37:20.160 --> 03:37:22.380]   that the sperm don't know which direction to go,
[03:37:22.380 --> 03:37:25.160]   that they're confused almost implying
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:27.840]   that the sperm themselves are high on cannabis.
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:31.420]   Well, that's certainly not the argument that I'm making here
[03:37:31.420 --> 03:37:35.080]   but it does seem to be the case that people who use cannabis
[03:37:35.080 --> 03:37:38.680]   even once the sperm that are generated
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:43.140]   during that particular month or two months
[03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:45.700]   during which or after which they use cannabis
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:49.280]   have less forward motility
[03:37:49.280 --> 03:37:51.300]   and possibly altered morphology as well.
[03:37:51.300 --> 03:37:52.440]   Okay, I want to be very clear.
[03:37:52.440 --> 03:37:54.840]   I did not say that if you use cannabis once
[03:37:54.840 --> 03:37:58.160]   you are forever disrupting the motility
[03:37:58.160 --> 03:37:59.320]   and morphology of your sperm.
[03:37:59.320 --> 03:38:00.160]   I did not say that.
[03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:02.800]   What I said is that if you use cannabis once,
[03:38:02.800 --> 03:38:06.000]   then the sperm that are generated in the 60 days
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:10.360]   after that cannabis use are going to have a higher incidence
[03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:14.400]   of disrupted motility and perhaps morphology as well.
[03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:17.400]   Okay, remember sperm are continually generated
[03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:20.000]   every 60 days or so.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.360]   And so if you use cannabis once
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:24.280]   you are not forever disrupting your sperm
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:26.140]   but if you are using cannabis
[03:38:26.140 --> 03:38:28.920]   and then you are looking to conceive in the next 60 days,
[03:38:28.920 --> 03:38:32.880]   you're going to be reducing, we think significantly so,
[03:38:32.880 --> 03:38:36.640]   the number of quality, forwardly motile sperm.
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:39.460]   So the simple takeaway from this is avoid cannabis use.
[03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:41.400]   Although if you are going to use cannabis,
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:44.120]   and again, there are medical uses of cannabis
[03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:46.560]   and beneficial uses of cannabis for certain populations.
[03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:48.260]   It can be bad for other populations.
[03:38:48.260 --> 03:38:50.500]   We talked about that in the Huberman Lab podcast
[03:38:50.500 --> 03:38:51.520]   all about cannabis.
[03:38:51.520 --> 03:38:53.220]   But if you're going to use cannabis,
[03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:55.880]   you should try and abstain from cannabis
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:38:59.680]   in the two months prior to the attempt to fertilize
[03:38:59.680 --> 03:39:01.080]   and get pregnant.
[03:39:01.080 --> 03:39:04.640]   Now I'm not aware of any data on how cannabis use
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:06.960]   by the woman can influence the likelihood
[03:39:06.960 --> 03:39:08.560]   of fertilization in pregnancy.
[03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:11.260]   And I want to couch this whole discussion around cannabis
[03:39:11.260 --> 03:39:13.480]   under the umbrella of something that came up in the episode
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:15.600]   that I did on cannabis, which is that
[03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:19.640]   for about half of people out there, male and female, okay?
[03:39:19.640 --> 03:39:22.580]   So here we're not distinguishing by biological sex.
[03:39:22.580 --> 03:39:25.640]   About half of people that use cannabis
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:27.280]   report it as an aphrodisiac.
[03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:29.740]   It makes them want to have sexual intercourse
[03:39:29.740 --> 03:39:31.720]   more than if they don't use cannabis.
[03:39:31.720 --> 03:39:34.680]   And for the other half, it actually has the opposite effect
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:37.480]   by way of an influence on a hormone called prolactin,
[03:39:37.480 --> 03:39:39.480]   which suppresses the dopamine system,
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:42.240]   the testosterone, and the estrogenic system.
[03:39:42.240 --> 03:39:45.160]   And so this whole idea that cannabis is an aphrodisiac
[03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:47.680]   seems to be true for about half of the human population
[03:39:47.680 --> 03:39:50.060]   and not for the other half of the human population.
[03:39:50.060 --> 03:39:52.520]   So I mentioned that because I know a number of people
[03:39:52.520 --> 03:39:55.600]   use cannabis as an aphrodisiac,
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:57.600]   but they like to use cannabis before intercourse.
[03:39:57.600 --> 03:40:00.620]   It was actually very surprising to me to discover
[03:40:00.620 --> 03:40:02.620]   when I researched that cannabis episode
[03:40:02.620 --> 03:40:07.620]   that approximately 15, 1.5% of women who are pregnant
[03:40:07.620 --> 03:40:10.440]   continue to use cannabis during pregnancy.
[03:40:10.440 --> 03:40:12.620]   And that's a very alarming statistic.
[03:40:12.620 --> 03:40:16.320]   And everything we know is that the use of cannabis
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:19.120]   during pregnancy is detrimental to the health,
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:21.340]   in particular the brain development of the fetus.
[03:40:21.340 --> 03:40:23.120]   So that's a real concern.
[03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:25.900]   I highly recommend women abstain from cannabis use
[03:40:25.900 --> 03:40:27.500]   during pregnancy.
[03:40:27.500 --> 03:40:30.200]   Talk to your OB/GYN about it if you're using it all
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:31.720]   or considering using it all.
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:33.760]   So based on what I told you earlier about the fact
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:37.600]   that cannabis use is not good for egg quality,
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:39.400]   and the fact that cannabis use
[03:40:39.400 --> 03:40:40.880]   can disrupt the motility of sperm,
[03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:44.320]   and therefore is not good for sperm quality,
[03:40:44.320 --> 03:40:47.280]   and it can disrupt the patterns of swimming in sperm
[03:40:47.280 --> 03:40:50.260]   in ways that reduce the likelihood of fertility,
[03:40:50.260 --> 03:40:51.620]   I think the take-home message is clear,
[03:40:51.620 --> 03:40:53.280]   which is that whether or not
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:55.480]   you want to be a cannabis user or not,
[03:40:55.480 --> 03:40:57.540]   if you are going to try and conceive,
[03:40:57.540 --> 03:40:58.700]   and certainly while you're pregnant,
[03:40:58.700 --> 03:41:00.900]   you're going to want to avoid the use of cannabis,
[03:41:00.900 --> 03:41:03.980]   and that is smoked cannabis and vaped cannabis.
[03:41:03.980 --> 03:41:07.980]   And during pregnancy, the consumption of cannabis,
[03:41:07.980 --> 03:41:09.980]   even in edible form or in tincture form,
[03:41:09.980 --> 03:41:13.020]   is also going to be detrimental to the developing fetus.
[03:41:13.020 --> 03:41:15.220]   But of course, we started this conversation
[03:41:15.220 --> 03:41:17.580]   in the context of body position,
[03:41:17.580 --> 03:41:19.520]   in particular at the point of ejaculation,
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:21.520]   in determining the sex of the offspring
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:23.780]   and/or the likelihood
[03:41:23.780 --> 03:41:26.780]   of getting a successful fertilization in pregnancy.
[03:41:26.780 --> 03:41:31.000]   And I think that given that the tilting back of the pelvis,
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:34.280]   so again, this is elevating the pelvis by about 20 degrees,
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:36.300]   I don't think it has to be exact, exact,
[03:41:36.300 --> 03:41:38.940]   but about 20 degrees for about 15 minutes
[03:41:38.940 --> 03:41:41.800]   post-ejaculation inside of the woman,
[03:41:41.800 --> 03:41:43.720]   or I suppose if people are using IUI,
[03:41:43.720 --> 03:41:45.740]   intrauterine insemination,
[03:41:45.740 --> 03:41:48.760]   since that seems to be the consensus among those experts
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:53.140]   that believe that pelvic tilt backward
[03:41:53.140 --> 03:41:54.620]   can be beneficial
[03:41:54.620 --> 03:41:56.740]   for increasing the probability of fertilization.
[03:41:56.740 --> 03:41:58.620]   And given that it involves no cost,
[03:41:58.620 --> 03:41:59.660]   but a little bit of time,
[03:41:59.660 --> 03:42:01.720]   seems to me that if you want to get pregnant,
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:03.740]   that that would be the right thing to do.
[03:42:03.740 --> 03:42:05.380]   And as far as I know, there's no information,
[03:42:05.380 --> 03:42:09.020]   nor was I able to obtain any recommendations from experts
[03:42:09.020 --> 03:42:12.340]   about what the ideal body position of the male is
[03:42:12.340 --> 03:42:13.420]   after ejaculation,
[03:42:13.420 --> 03:42:15.460]   if the goal is to increase the probability
[03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:17.420]   of fertilization in pregnancy.
[03:42:17.420 --> 03:42:19.640]   So we've been talking about behavioral interventions,
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:20.700]   some dos and some don'ts,
[03:42:20.700 --> 03:42:22.700]   that people can do to increase their fertility
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:25.340]   and the likelihood that any fertilized egg
[03:42:25.340 --> 03:42:27.740]   will be carried to term successfully.
[03:42:27.740 --> 03:42:29.660]   And soon we'll also talk about things
[03:42:29.660 --> 03:42:32.260]   that people can take to improve their fertility.
[03:42:32.260 --> 03:42:34.400]   Now keep in mind that this entire discussion
[03:42:34.400 --> 03:42:35.940]   is about fertility,
[03:42:35.940 --> 03:42:38.020]   but also remember as we discussed
[03:42:38.020 --> 03:42:40.260]   at the beginning of the episode,
[03:42:40.260 --> 03:42:42.940]   trying to increase your fertility
[03:42:42.940 --> 03:42:44.960]   is one of the best ways to think about
[03:42:44.960 --> 03:42:49.500]   trying to create and maintain optimal physical health.
[03:42:49.500 --> 03:42:51.060]   So for people that are trying to conceive
[03:42:51.060 --> 03:42:53.300]   and for people who are not trying to conceive,
[03:42:53.300 --> 03:42:55.180]   optimizing your fertility status,
[03:42:55.180 --> 03:42:56.900]   whether or not you're male or female,
[03:42:56.900 --> 03:42:59.860]   it's one of the best ways to target those approaches.
[03:42:59.860 --> 03:43:02.420]   And there are now a lot of data supporting the idea
[03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:04.740]   that acupuncture of all things
[03:43:04.740 --> 03:43:06.920]   can be very beneficial for improving
[03:43:06.920 --> 03:43:08.700]   both female and male fertility
[03:43:08.700 --> 03:43:11.000]   and should a woman get pregnant
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.320]   for improving the quality of outcomes.
[03:43:13.320 --> 03:43:15.820]   That is the likelihood that there will be
[03:43:15.820 --> 03:43:19.640]   a successful pregnancy that is carried to term,
[03:43:19.640 --> 03:43:22.480]   not premature and so on and so forth.
[03:43:22.480 --> 03:43:23.640]   Now, for some of you out there,
[03:43:23.640 --> 03:43:25.200]   you might think, oh, of course acupuncture.
[03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:27.760]   Acupuncture has been known to work for thousands of years.
[03:43:27.760 --> 03:43:30.220]   And therefore it's not surprising
[03:43:30.220 --> 03:43:33.380]   that it would assist with fertility and pregnancy.
[03:43:33.380 --> 03:43:35.240]   For many of you out there, however,
[03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:36.520]   probably thinking acupuncture,
[03:43:36.520 --> 03:43:38.520]   that seems kind of like fringe science.
[03:43:38.520 --> 03:43:40.420]   But what I can assure you is that
[03:43:40.420 --> 03:43:42.920]   there are now quite a few clinical trials
[03:43:42.920 --> 03:43:44.340]   funded by government agencies
[03:43:44.340 --> 03:43:46.860]   like the National Institutes of Health
[03:43:46.860 --> 03:43:49.420]   showing that acupuncture is a very effective treatment
[03:43:49.420 --> 03:43:50.780]   for a number of different things,
[03:43:50.780 --> 03:43:52.820]   including fertility and pregnancy,
[03:43:52.820 --> 03:43:56.100]   but for hormone status, for stress relief,
[03:43:56.100 --> 03:43:59.020]   but even for chronic illnesses of different kinds,
[03:43:59.020 --> 03:44:00.660]   including autoimmune illnesses.
[03:44:00.660 --> 03:44:02.860]   So this is no longer considered fringe science.
[03:44:02.860 --> 03:44:05.420]   In fact, one of the best laboratories in the world
[03:44:05.420 --> 03:44:07.160]   working on this is a laboratory
[03:44:07.160 --> 03:44:08.700]   out of Harvard Medical School
[03:44:08.700 --> 03:44:10.860]   run by a guy named Chufu Ma.
[03:44:10.860 --> 03:44:14.660]   Chufu's lab has really been exploring in a mechanistic way
[03:44:14.660 --> 03:44:16.860]   how the different stimulation sites
[03:44:16.860 --> 03:44:18.180]   that are used in acupuncture,
[03:44:18.180 --> 03:44:19.940]   so where the needles are inserted,
[03:44:19.940 --> 03:44:21.640]   tap into neural pathways
[03:44:21.640 --> 03:44:23.860]   that link the different organs of the body.
[03:44:23.860 --> 03:44:26.860]   So for instance, they've found that stimulation
[03:44:26.860 --> 03:44:29.820]   of a particular site on the lower limb
[03:44:29.820 --> 03:44:33.180]   can reduce inflammation dramatically throughout the body
[03:44:33.180 --> 03:44:36.780]   by way of neural pathways that originate in the lower limb
[03:44:36.780 --> 03:44:39.920]   and extend to areas such as the kidney and the pancreas.
[03:44:39.920 --> 03:44:43.640]   So all these quote-unquote ancient maps of the human body
[03:44:43.640 --> 03:44:44.900]   as they relate to acupuncture
[03:44:44.900 --> 03:44:47.340]   are now being parsed at the level of mechanism,
[03:44:47.340 --> 03:44:48.380]   which I think is wonderful
[03:44:48.380 --> 03:44:50.660]   because it not only is showing us
[03:44:50.660 --> 03:44:54.280]   that so much of what has been purported and reported
[03:44:54.280 --> 03:44:56.240]   in the landscape of acupuncture
[03:44:56.240 --> 03:44:58.840]   actually has an underlying mechanistic basis.
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:01.420]   And with additional mechanistic understanding, of course,
[03:45:01.420 --> 03:45:03.620]   always arrive new and better practices.
[03:45:03.620 --> 03:45:06.820]   That's the idea to evolve these fields of acupuncture,
[03:45:06.820 --> 03:45:08.920]   to evolve the fields of mechanistic understanding
[03:45:08.920 --> 03:45:10.500]   of our biology and health.
[03:45:10.500 --> 03:45:13.880]   And so the issue of whether or not acupuncture
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:15.740]   can assist in getting pregnant
[03:45:15.740 --> 03:45:18.460]   and in carrying a child to term
[03:45:18.460 --> 03:45:19.980]   and for that child to be healthy
[03:45:19.980 --> 03:45:23.340]   are really starting to emerge in a major way.
[03:45:23.340 --> 03:45:25.700]   And rather than go into all those data in detail,
[03:45:25.700 --> 03:45:28.360]   what I can tell you is that there are clinical trials
[03:45:28.360 --> 03:45:31.340]   and data supporting the fact that female fertility itself
[03:45:31.340 --> 03:45:35.440]   can be supported by acupuncture through several mechanisms.
[03:45:35.440 --> 03:45:38.100]   One of which is the balancing,
[03:45:38.100 --> 03:45:39.580]   and I realize that's a somewhat tricky term
[03:45:39.580 --> 03:45:40.960]   and I'll define it better in a moment,
[03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:42.040]   the balancing of hormones
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:46.120]   across the ovulatory/menstrual cycle,
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:48.120]   including regulating levels of FSH
[03:45:48.120 --> 03:45:50.440]   so that they're not too high nor too low
[03:45:50.440 --> 03:45:53.560]   and restricting the FSH to the follicular phase
[03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:55.840]   of the menstrual cycle,
[03:45:55.840 --> 03:45:59.680]   as well as using acupuncture to improve things
[03:45:59.680 --> 03:46:02.560]   like blood flow and the health of the ovary itself
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:05.840]   and other aspects of the female reproductive axis.
[03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:09.060]   So acupuncture can operate at the chemical level
[03:46:09.060 --> 03:46:10.120]   impacting hormones.
[03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:12.500]   It can act at the mechanical level
[03:46:12.500 --> 03:46:14.320]   impacting the different tissues
[03:46:14.320 --> 03:46:17.100]   through which the egg has to pass and so on and so forth.
[03:46:17.100 --> 03:46:18.960]   Likewise, on the male side,
[03:46:18.960 --> 03:46:22.960]   acupuncture has been shown to improve semen volume,
[03:46:22.960 --> 03:46:26.600]   quality of sperm, sperm motility, et cetera,
[03:46:26.600 --> 03:46:30.440]   and in large part through changes in the neural pathways
[03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:34.840]   that innervate the very tissues and vascular input
[03:46:34.840 --> 03:46:36.600]   to the scrotum and testicles,
[03:46:36.600 --> 03:46:38.820]   because as we learned earlier,
[03:46:38.820 --> 03:46:40.820]   temperature regulation of the scrotum and testicles
[03:46:40.820 --> 03:46:43.440]   is so vital for getting healthy sperm
[03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:45.460]   and increasing sperm quality.
[03:46:45.460 --> 03:46:48.320]   In addition, there are good data to support the idea
[03:46:48.320 --> 03:46:50.960]   that acupuncture can increase levels
[03:46:50.960 --> 03:46:52.680]   of testosterone-free testosterone
[03:46:52.680 --> 03:46:55.240]   and the sorts of hormones that are going to support
[03:46:55.240 --> 03:46:59.320]   healthy hormone production and sperm production in males.
[03:46:59.320 --> 03:47:03.260]   And this is distinct from applying testosterone
[03:47:03.260 --> 03:47:04.720]   from an exogenous source, right?
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:06.140]   So when we're talking about acupuncture
[03:47:06.140 --> 03:47:07.680]   and increasing levels of testosterone,
[03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:09.160]   we're talking about increasing levels
[03:47:09.160 --> 03:47:11.180]   of endogenous testosterone.
[03:47:11.180 --> 03:47:13.660]   So those Leydig cells can support the Sertoli cells
[03:47:13.660 --> 03:47:16.260]   and the Sertoli cells can make that androgen binding protein
[03:47:16.260 --> 03:47:18.700]   and you get enhanced spermatogenesis.
[03:47:18.700 --> 03:47:21.040]   You can find evidence for all of these different features,
[03:47:21.040 --> 03:47:23.420]   both changes to the chemical milieu, that is the hormones,
[03:47:23.420 --> 03:47:25.340]   and changes to the mechanical milieu,
[03:47:25.340 --> 03:47:28.580]   including, for instance, improvement of the pathways
[03:47:28.580 --> 03:47:31.100]   leading from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis
[03:47:31.100 --> 03:47:33.680]   to the vas deferens, basically clearing out the plumbing
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:36.340]   so that more quality ejaculate can be delivered,
[03:47:36.340 --> 03:47:37.740]   which of course is going to increase
[03:47:37.740 --> 03:47:39.820]   the probability of fertilization.
[03:47:39.820 --> 03:47:41.960]   So when you hear that acupuncture can improve
[03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:45.220]   the likelihood of pregnancy, that's an accurate statement
[03:47:45.220 --> 03:47:47.300]   for which there are now increasing amounts
[03:47:47.300 --> 03:47:48.580]   of mechanistic data.
[03:47:48.580 --> 03:47:50.900]   If you want to learn more about how acupuncture
[03:47:50.900 --> 03:47:52.580]   can be used to contribute
[03:47:52.580 --> 03:47:55.060]   to improve fertilization in pregnancy,
[03:47:55.060 --> 03:47:57.700]   there are a number of different excellent reviews on this,
[03:47:57.700 --> 03:48:01.460]   both as it relates to females and as it relates to males.
[03:48:01.460 --> 03:48:04.020]   One of the best papers that I happen to like
[03:48:04.020 --> 03:48:06.220]   is one that we'll provide a link to in the references
[03:48:06.220 --> 03:48:07.940]   entitled Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine
[03:48:07.940 --> 03:48:10.820]   for Female Fertility, an Overview of Systematic Reviews.
[03:48:10.820 --> 03:48:13.420]   So a review of reviews.
[03:48:13.420 --> 03:48:16.180]   This was published recently in 2021.
[03:48:16.180 --> 03:48:17.540]   We'll provide a link to that.
[03:48:17.540 --> 03:48:20.860]   And there's also going to be a link to a review
[03:48:20.860 --> 03:48:23.500]   that relates to acupuncture for male fertility
[03:48:23.500 --> 03:48:25.180]   and hormone augmentation.
[03:48:25.180 --> 03:48:26.820]   I should just mention briefly
[03:48:26.820 --> 03:48:29.580]   that if you're going to look at scientific papers,
[03:48:29.580 --> 03:48:31.340]   one thing that you'll want to consider
[03:48:31.340 --> 03:48:33.740]   is also looking at the references that they reference.
[03:48:33.740 --> 03:48:36.260]   Now, of course, papers tend to reference a ton of references
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:37.560]   in particular in reviews.
[03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:39.900]   So what you'll want to do is look for the references
[03:48:39.900 --> 03:48:42.880]   that are showing up most often in the introduction.
[03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:44.820]   Those references often are going to be
[03:48:44.820 --> 03:48:46.860]   the most prominent recent reviews
[03:48:46.860 --> 03:48:49.480]   or the most important findings in recent years.
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:51.800]   That's not always the case, but that's often the case.
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:53.540]   So if you read the first couple of paragraphs
[03:48:53.540 --> 03:48:55.420]   of these papers, and these are openly available
[03:48:55.420 --> 03:48:58.680]   as full text, by the way, online, if you go to these links,
[03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:01.280]   you'll be able to access the best papers,
[03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:03.300]   the most relevant papers in the context
[03:49:03.300 --> 03:49:05.580]   of acupuncture supporting female
[03:49:05.580 --> 03:49:08.580]   and acupuncture supporting male fertility
[03:49:08.580 --> 03:49:09.740]   and hormone status.
[03:49:09.740 --> 03:49:12.460]   Now I'd like to discuss things that both men and women
[03:49:12.460 --> 03:49:15.460]   can take in order to maximize their fertility.
[03:49:15.460 --> 03:49:19.520]   And again, and again, when we're talking about fertility,
[03:49:19.520 --> 03:49:21.900]   we're talking about people who want to conceive
[03:49:21.900 --> 03:49:24.900]   and have children, but also we're talking about
[03:49:24.900 --> 03:49:27.940]   a basic measure of overall health status.
[03:49:27.940 --> 03:49:31.060]   So if you're somebody who does not want to conceive children,
[03:49:31.060 --> 03:49:32.960]   I still encourage you to think about
[03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:34.980]   whether or not you would want to do certain things
[03:49:34.980 --> 03:49:36.500]   or not do certain things
[03:49:36.500 --> 03:49:38.480]   in order to maximize your fertility
[03:49:38.480 --> 03:49:41.880]   as a means to maximize your vitality and longevity,
[03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:44.880]   because that's really what maximizing fertility is about
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:46.140]   for a lot of people.
[03:49:46.140 --> 03:49:47.540]   That said, I know a lot of people
[03:49:47.540 --> 03:49:48.820]   would like to conceive children,
[03:49:48.820 --> 03:49:50.780]   perhaps not right away, but in the future.
[03:49:50.780 --> 03:49:52.260]   And what I'm about to describe
[03:49:52.260 --> 03:49:54.400]   are some tools and interventions,
[03:49:54.400 --> 03:49:56.940]   that is things that one can take
[03:49:56.940 --> 03:50:00.100]   in order to improve their hormone status,
[03:50:00.100 --> 03:50:03.120]   but also in particular, the quality of their eggs
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:06.440]   and the quality of their sperm in the short and long term.
[03:50:06.440 --> 03:50:09.000]   The first on the list of things that people can take
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:11.600]   in order to improve egg quality or sperm quality
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:13.320]   is L-carnitine.
[03:50:13.320 --> 03:50:15.580]   L-carnitine is present in various foods,
[03:50:15.580 --> 03:50:17.420]   in particular in red meats.
[03:50:17.420 --> 03:50:18.900]   But again, it's going to be very hard
[03:50:18.900 --> 03:50:20.820]   to get sufficient levels of L-carnitine
[03:50:20.820 --> 03:50:23.020]   to improve egg quality and sperm quality
[03:50:23.020 --> 03:50:25.100]   unless you're going to take it in supplement form.
[03:50:25.100 --> 03:50:28.300]   The typical recommendation based on peer reviewed studies,
[03:50:28.300 --> 03:50:30.820]   they've shown significant improvements in egg quality,
[03:50:30.820 --> 03:50:33.200]   that is chromosomal arrangements,
[03:50:33.200 --> 03:50:36.480]   that is the likelihood of fertility or pregnancy rather,
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:39.960]   the likelihood of sperm being forward fast swimmers
[03:50:39.960 --> 03:50:41.500]   as opposed to twitchers or remote tile
[03:50:41.500 --> 03:50:42.660]   and having proper morphology.
[03:50:42.660 --> 03:50:45.500]   All those measures has been demonstrated
[03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:47.360]   to be significantly improved
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:48.820]   by the ingestion of L-carnitine.
[03:50:48.820 --> 03:50:50.000]   How much L-carnitine?
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:52.540]   Well, that depends on how you're obtaining the L-carnitine.
[03:50:52.540 --> 03:50:55.020]   If you're obtaining it in capsule form,
[03:50:56.180 --> 03:51:00.320]   one to three grams per day of capsule form L-carnitine
[03:51:00.320 --> 03:51:02.860]   is what's been suggested to improve egg quality
[03:51:02.860 --> 03:51:04.180]   and sperm quality.
[03:51:04.180 --> 03:51:07.220]   Now, one to three grams per day can be taken all at once
[03:51:07.220 --> 03:51:09.280]   or spread out throughout the 24 hour cycle.
[03:51:09.280 --> 03:51:12.180]   It can be taken with or without food,
[03:51:12.180 --> 03:51:13.860]   does not seem to matter.
[03:51:13.860 --> 03:51:17.540]   And when taken for a period of 30 to 60 days,
[03:51:17.540 --> 03:51:20.580]   it does seem to significantly improve all the parameters
[03:51:20.580 --> 03:51:23.700]   that have been discussed for egg quality and sperm quality.
[03:51:23.700 --> 03:51:26.180]   Now, the mechanism for that effect is pretty clear.
[03:51:26.180 --> 03:51:31.180]   L-carnitine is involved in the processing of lipids fats
[03:51:31.180 --> 03:51:34.100]   in terms of mitochondrial function.
[03:51:34.100 --> 03:51:35.460]   And as we talked about before,
[03:51:35.460 --> 03:51:39.240]   mitochondria are vital for the organization
[03:51:39.240 --> 03:51:41.740]   and action of the spindle that pulls apart the chromosomes,
[03:51:41.740 --> 03:51:44.340]   taking that cell within the female
[03:51:44.340 --> 03:51:47.320]   from diploid to haploid, which is essential.
[03:51:47.320 --> 03:51:51.120]   You really want just the 23 individual chromosomal strands.
[03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:53.680]   You don't want chromosomal repeats.
[03:51:53.680 --> 03:51:56.760]   It's also involved in the actual fusion of the egg
[03:51:56.760 --> 03:52:01.080]   as it exits the ovary and enters the ovulation cycle.
[03:52:01.080 --> 03:52:03.560]   Mitochondria are also important, as we talked about before,
[03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:05.000]   for the forward motility of sperm
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:06.400]   because of the enrichment of mitochondria
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:08.280]   in that mid-region just behind the head
[03:52:08.280 --> 03:52:11.460]   that caused the whipping flagellation of the tail
[03:52:11.460 --> 03:52:12.880]   allowing for forward movement,
[03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:15.260]   as well as other aspects of cellular morphology.
[03:52:15.260 --> 03:52:16.480]   So it makes a lot of sense
[03:52:16.480 --> 03:52:19.640]   as to why L-carnitine supplementation would be beneficial.
[03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:21.760]   Again, it's one to three grams per day
[03:52:21.760 --> 03:52:23.400]   over a period of about 30 to 60 months.
[03:52:23.400 --> 03:52:25.620]   If you're hoping to conceive in the upcoming months,
[03:52:25.620 --> 03:52:28.420]   recommend taking it for at least 30 days prior to that.
[03:52:28.420 --> 03:52:32.200]   Of course, based on the data we talked about before,
[03:52:32.200 --> 03:52:34.480]   cumulative probability, fecundability, et cetera,
[03:52:34.480 --> 03:52:37.040]   there's no reason to not continue to try for pregnancy
[03:52:37.040 --> 03:52:38.640]   before taking L-carnitine,
[03:52:38.640 --> 03:52:41.560]   but L-carnitine is going to improve egg and sperm quality.
[03:52:41.560 --> 03:52:44.820]   And so you might actually take the stance
[03:52:44.820 --> 03:52:48.420]   that even if you don't have any problem getting pregnant,
[03:52:48.420 --> 03:52:51.720]   wouldn't you want to maximize the quality of the egg
[03:52:51.720 --> 03:52:52.620]   that gets fertilized
[03:52:52.620 --> 03:52:55.180]   and the quality of the sperm that fertilizes that egg.
[03:52:55.180 --> 03:52:58.340]   So that's additional rationale for taking L-carnitine.
[03:52:58.340 --> 03:52:59.760]   One important note,
[03:52:59.760 --> 03:53:02.120]   if you are going to take L-carnitine in oral form,
[03:53:02.120 --> 03:53:05.980]   in capsule form, it can increase something called TMAO.
[03:53:05.980 --> 03:53:08.380]   TMAO can cause stiffening of the arteries.
[03:53:08.380 --> 03:53:10.720]   You don't want TMAO levels to go too high.
[03:53:10.720 --> 03:53:13.360]   One way to offset the increases in TMAO
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:15.060]   caused by oral L-carnitine
[03:53:15.060 --> 03:53:18.940]   is to take 600 milligrams of garlic per day.
[03:53:18.940 --> 03:53:20.280]   I suppose you could eat cloves of garlic.
[03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:21.200]   That would work just as well
[03:53:21.200 --> 03:53:23.340]   because garlic contains something called allicin,
[03:53:23.340 --> 03:53:26.140]   which can offset the increase in TMAO.
[03:53:26.140 --> 03:53:29.560]   But 600 milligram capsules of garlic are going to be,
[03:53:29.560 --> 03:53:31.620]   or garlic extract rather,
[03:53:31.620 --> 03:53:34.460]   is going to be the most probably cost-effective
[03:53:34.460 --> 03:53:36.960]   and simplest way to do this.
[03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:39.680]   And also they are going to create that garlic smell.
[03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:41.580]   Some people like the smell of garlic, some people don't.
[03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:43.600]   So if you're going to take oral L-carnitine,
[03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:46.280]   I suggest also taking 600 milligrams a day
[03:53:46.280 --> 03:53:48.300]   of garlic extract.
[03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:49.980]   And you can do that at any time throughout the day.
[03:53:49.980 --> 03:53:52.480]   It doesn't have to be with the L-carnitine.
[03:53:52.480 --> 03:53:54.340]   The next item on the list of compounds
[03:53:54.340 --> 03:53:55.940]   that have been shown to improve egg quality
[03:53:55.940 --> 03:54:00.620]   and sperm quality, and quite robustly so, is coenzyme Q10.
[03:54:00.620 --> 03:54:02.420]   Coenzyme Q10 is something
[03:54:02.420 --> 03:54:05.300]   that you can actually measure levels of in your blood.
[03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:06.300]   Most physicians will say
[03:54:06.300 --> 03:54:08.360]   that they want to see your levels of coenzyme Q10
[03:54:08.360 --> 03:54:10.680]   to be somewhere between 0.5 and 2.5.
[03:54:10.680 --> 03:54:12.140]   It's going to depend on the units.
[03:54:12.140 --> 03:54:13.740]   Most people, I realize, are not going to run off
[03:54:13.740 --> 03:54:15.760]   and get their CoQ10 measured.
[03:54:15.760 --> 03:54:17.800]   It's not included in most standard blood tests,
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:19.460]   but if you were to measure your CoQ10,
[03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:21.700]   that's the range that you want to look for.
[03:54:21.700 --> 03:54:25.260]   That said, many people opt to supplement with CoQ10,
[03:54:25.260 --> 03:54:27.760]   and you'll find that many fertility docs,
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:29.940]   OBGYNs, and urologists that are trying
[03:54:29.940 --> 03:54:31.620]   to assist their male patients with fertility
[03:54:31.620 --> 03:54:33.600]   will suggest CoQ10 because, again,
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:36.200]   it supports the health of mitochondria.
[03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:39.220]   Mitochondria are so vital to so many aspects
[03:54:39.220 --> 03:54:44.220]   of the formation and fertilization of the egg and sperm
[03:54:44.220 --> 03:54:47.580]   that, of course, fertilizes the egg.
[03:54:47.580 --> 03:54:50.980]   The coenzyme Q10 dosages that are most often suggested
[03:54:50.980 --> 03:54:52.340]   and that you'll observe
[03:54:52.340 --> 03:54:55.340]   in the peer-reviewed research literature on humans,
[03:54:55.340 --> 03:54:59.740]   I should add, is 100 to 400 milligrams per day,
[03:54:59.740 --> 03:55:03.060]   and the coenzyme Q10 is taken generally with a meal
[03:55:03.060 --> 03:55:05.780]   and ideally a meal that contains fat.
[03:55:05.780 --> 03:55:08.740]   And there's even some idea that taking coenzyme Q10
[03:55:08.740 --> 03:55:12.700]   with your dinner, assuming that dinner includes some fat,
[03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:14.160]   you don't have to add additional fat,
[03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:15.680]   is going to be more advantageous
[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:18.460]   than taking coenzyme Q10 early in the day,
[03:55:18.460 --> 03:55:19.840]   although that's probably a detail
[03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:21.540]   that's getting a little too far down in the wheat.
[03:55:21.540 --> 03:55:24.820]   So again, 100 to 400 milligrams of coenzyme Q10 per day,
[03:55:24.820 --> 03:55:26.700]   whether or not you're a man or a woman,
[03:55:26.700 --> 03:55:29.400]   for improving the likelihood of fertility
[03:55:29.400 --> 03:55:31.500]   by way of improving egg and sperm quality.
[03:55:31.500 --> 03:55:32.420]   And again, if you're somebody
[03:55:32.420 --> 03:55:34.500]   who just doesn't have any problem getting pregnant
[03:55:34.500 --> 03:55:36.960]   or if you're already producing many sperm
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:39.220]   of quality morphology, this is another case
[03:55:39.220 --> 03:55:41.040]   in which you could take a step back and just say,
[03:55:41.040 --> 03:55:43.200]   well, why wouldn't I want to further optimize
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:44.500]   the quality of the egg and the sperm?
[03:55:44.500 --> 03:55:45.900]   Because the quality of the egg and the sperm
[03:55:45.900 --> 03:55:47.700]   ultimately are going to determine
[03:55:47.700 --> 03:55:49.940]   not just whether or not you have a successful pregnancy,
[03:55:49.940 --> 03:55:53.540]   but are going to determine admittedly in ways
[03:55:53.540 --> 03:55:55.940]   that will forever remain cryptic to you,
[03:55:55.940 --> 03:55:57.500]   but nonetheless are going to be important
[03:55:57.500 --> 03:56:00.820]   in determining the qualities of the brain tissue
[03:56:00.820 --> 03:56:02.780]   and body tissue of your offspring.
[03:56:02.780 --> 03:56:04.480]   The third item on the list of compounds
[03:56:04.480 --> 03:56:08.340]   which are commonly suggested or prescribed
[03:56:08.340 --> 03:56:10.860]   by fertility docs nowadays for men and women
[03:56:10.860 --> 03:56:13.420]   wishing to conceive and or optimize their fertility
[03:56:13.420 --> 03:56:17.760]   as a basis for general vitality and health is inositol.
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:19.800]   Now inositol has many uses.
[03:56:19.800 --> 03:56:21.480]   So you'll hear about the use of inositol
[03:56:21.480 --> 03:56:23.980]   for reducing anxiety or improving mood
[03:56:23.980 --> 03:56:25.300]   or even for the treatment of depression.
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:26.460]   We talked about inositol
[03:56:26.460 --> 03:56:28.920]   in previous episodes of this podcast.
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:31.580]   For instance, I talked about inositol
[03:56:31.580 --> 03:56:35.380]   and in particular taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol
[03:56:35.380 --> 03:56:37.400]   prior to sleep, which is something that I do
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:39.200]   along with the other supplements
[03:56:39.200 --> 03:56:40.720]   that I take and recommend for sleep
[03:56:40.720 --> 03:56:44.460]   such as magnesium threonate, apigenin and theanine.
[03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:45.600]   If you're curious about those,
[03:56:45.600 --> 03:56:47.080]   you can see our newsletter on sleep
[03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:48.580]   or our perfect your sleep episode
[03:56:48.580 --> 03:56:50.640]   or the master sleep episode talks about behavioral
[03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:53.260]   and supplementation based tools for improving sleep.
[03:56:53.260 --> 03:56:58.260]   But myoinositol is not just suggested or prescribed
[03:56:58.260 --> 03:57:01.260]   for people that are wishing to get pregnant
[03:57:01.260 --> 03:57:02.680]   and for general health,
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:05.280]   but myoinositol is often recommended
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:08.040]   for people that want to improve egg and sperm quality
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:11.400]   because of the way that it can positively impact
[03:57:11.400 --> 03:57:12.920]   insulin sensitivity.
[03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:15.600]   Insulin sensitivity might sound like a bad thing
[03:57:15.600 --> 03:57:16.540]   to people out there,
[03:57:16.540 --> 03:57:19.840]   but it turns out that you want to be insulin sensitive.
[03:57:19.840 --> 03:57:22.420]   The last thing you want is to be insulin insensitive.
[03:57:22.420 --> 03:57:25.420]   Insulin insensitivity is associated with type 2 diabetes,
[03:57:25.420 --> 03:57:26.800]   with obesity and even for people
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:29.640]   who are not challenged with obesity,
[03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:31.820]   you want your cells to be insulin sensitive.
[03:57:31.820 --> 03:57:33.540]   You don't want a lot of insulin floating around
[03:57:33.540 --> 03:57:37.820]   in your system with your cells unable to use that insulin.
[03:57:37.820 --> 03:57:40.220]   That's really what insulin insensitivity is about.
[03:57:40.220 --> 03:57:45.220]   Myoinositol at dosages of one to five grams per day,
[03:57:45.220 --> 03:57:46.980]   it's pretty high, one to five grams per day,
[03:57:46.980 --> 03:57:50.240]   keeping in mind that 1,000 milligrams is one gram,
[03:57:50.240 --> 03:57:53.800]   has been suggested to improve egg quality and sperm quality.
[03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:56.500]   Now, one point of, I wouldn't say caution,
[03:57:56.500 --> 03:58:00.020]   but of note is that myoinositol can reduce anxiety
[03:58:00.020 --> 03:58:01.260]   and it can be a slight sedative,
[03:58:01.260 --> 03:58:03.660]   which is why some folks, including myself,
[03:58:03.660 --> 03:58:06.920]   take almost a gram, 900 milligrams prior to sleep.
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:10.900]   If you're going to take five grams of myoinositol,
[03:58:10.900 --> 03:58:13.300]   you would want to restrict that to the late evening
[03:58:13.300 --> 03:58:14.380]   or second half of your day.
[03:58:14.380 --> 03:58:15.900]   And I don't suggest starting that high.
[03:58:15.900 --> 03:58:17.380]   I would start with one or two grams
[03:58:17.380 --> 03:58:18.620]   and then working your way up,
[03:58:18.620 --> 03:58:20.380]   seeing what you can tolerate
[03:58:20.380 --> 03:58:23.460]   in terms of the level of anti-anxiety
[03:58:23.460 --> 03:58:25.200]   and drowsiness that it produces.
[03:58:26.340 --> 03:58:28.700]   One to five grams per day of myoinositol
[03:58:28.700 --> 03:58:30.460]   is what suggested for both men and women
[03:58:30.460 --> 03:58:34.300]   wishing to improve egg health and sperm health.
[03:58:34.300 --> 03:58:38.740]   But for women, it's also often suggested to include also,
[03:58:38.740 --> 03:58:40.660]   okay, so to take myoinositol,
[03:58:40.660 --> 03:58:43.540]   but to also take d-chiroinositol.
[03:58:43.540 --> 03:58:46.740]   D-chiroinositol has elements in it
[03:58:46.740 --> 03:58:50.180]   that can be both pro and anti-androgenic.
[03:58:50.180 --> 03:58:51.900]   Androgens are things like testosterone
[03:58:51.900 --> 03:58:53.500]   and related molecules.
[03:58:53.500 --> 03:58:56.280]   There are a number of different causes of infertility
[03:58:56.280 --> 03:58:58.160]   and disruption to egg quality,
[03:58:58.160 --> 03:59:00.680]   age being the most significant factor.
[03:59:00.680 --> 03:59:03.380]   But another significant and very common factor,
[03:59:03.380 --> 03:59:06.800]   even among young women who are of fertile age,
[03:59:06.800 --> 03:59:09.140]   is having too many androgens
[03:59:09.140 --> 03:59:10.480]   and as it relates to something called
[03:59:10.480 --> 03:59:12.260]   polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[03:59:12.260 --> 03:59:15.020]   And we'll do an entire episode about menopause and PCOS
[03:59:15.020 --> 03:59:17.640]   and a number of other things that relate to fertility
[03:59:17.640 --> 03:59:20.380]   because it's an entire and very interesting
[03:59:20.380 --> 03:59:22.220]   other discussion that we need to have.
[03:59:22.220 --> 03:59:24.160]   But the recommendation is that women take
[03:59:24.160 --> 03:59:26.220]   one to five grams of myoinositol,
[03:59:26.220 --> 03:59:29.000]   but also d-chiroinositol
[03:59:29.000 --> 03:59:32.000]   because of the ways that it can balance androgens
[03:59:32.000 --> 03:59:34.040]   and offset some of the negative effects
[03:59:34.040 --> 03:59:36.280]   of polycystic ovarian syndrome,
[03:59:36.280 --> 03:59:37.840]   or even for women who do not have
[03:59:37.840 --> 03:59:39.540]   polycystic ovarian syndrome,
[03:59:39.540 --> 03:59:41.540]   because of the ways that d-chiroinositol
[03:59:41.540 --> 03:59:44.700]   can balance androgens in ways that are beneficial.
[03:59:44.700 --> 03:59:48.620]   The dosages of d-chiroinositol that are recommended
[03:59:48.620 --> 03:59:53.380]   tend to be 1/25th to 1/40th of the myoinositol dose.
[03:59:53.380 --> 03:59:54.700]   So you have to get out your calculator.
[03:59:54.700 --> 03:59:57.020]   Remember 1,000 milligrams equals one gram.
[03:59:57.020 --> 03:59:58.820]   So figure out if you're taking one gram
[03:59:58.820 --> 04:00:01.340]   of myoinositol per day or two grams,
[04:00:01.340 --> 04:00:03.740]   you're going to want to convert that to milligrams.
[04:00:03.740 --> 04:00:05.420]   So let's say you're taking two grams
[04:00:05.420 --> 04:00:08.340]   of myoinositol per day, that's 2,000 milligrams,
[04:00:08.340 --> 04:00:10.700]   then you'd want to divide that by 25.
[04:00:10.700 --> 04:00:13.900]   And that's how many milligrams of d-chiroinositol
[04:00:13.900 --> 04:00:15.460]   you would want to take as well.
[04:00:15.460 --> 04:00:17.380]   Or you could go with the lower end dose
[04:00:17.380 --> 04:00:21.140]   and divide it by 40 and take that number of milligrams
[04:00:21.140 --> 04:00:24.340]   of d-chiroinositol along with the inositol.
[04:00:24.340 --> 04:00:26.200]   Again, probably taking it later in the day
[04:00:26.200 --> 04:00:27.100]   is going to be good.
[04:00:27.100 --> 04:00:29.860]   And it's not clear at all that taking it with food
[04:00:29.860 --> 04:00:31.660]   or without food makes any difference whatsoever.
[04:00:31.660 --> 04:00:33.740]   So I would suggest you do either.
[04:00:33.740 --> 04:00:36.260]   Keep in mind as I'm discussing these recommendations,
[04:00:36.260 --> 04:00:37.460]   I may call them prescriptions,
[04:00:37.460 --> 04:00:38.820]   but none of these are prescription drugs.
[04:00:38.820 --> 04:00:41.700]   And of course you should always discuss any supplements
[04:00:41.700 --> 04:00:44.020]   that you're planning to take or stop taking
[04:00:44.020 --> 04:00:45.640]   for that matter with your physician.
[04:00:45.640 --> 04:00:48.260]   I don't say that to protect me, I say that to protect you.
[04:00:48.260 --> 04:00:49.940]   Anytime you're going to add or change something
[04:00:49.940 --> 04:00:51.060]   in your overall health regimen,
[04:00:51.060 --> 04:00:52.080]   you want to discuss that
[04:00:52.080 --> 04:00:54.620]   with your trusted healthcare professional.
[04:00:54.620 --> 04:00:57.620]   Typically I would hope a board certified MD.
[04:00:57.620 --> 04:01:01.500]   The fourth item in the list of commonly suggested supplements
[04:01:01.500 --> 04:01:04.400]   for men and women wishing to optimize egg
[04:01:04.400 --> 04:01:08.700]   and sperm quality respectively is omega-3 fatty acids.
[04:01:08.700 --> 04:01:10.240]   And now here we're talking about something
[04:01:10.240 --> 04:01:11.760]   that could be obtained from food
[04:01:11.760 --> 04:01:12.840]   and can be obtained from food.
[04:01:12.840 --> 04:01:15.600]   So if you're consuming a fatty ocean fish,
[04:01:15.600 --> 04:01:19.280]   things like sardines, anchovies, salmon with the skin,
[04:01:19.280 --> 04:01:22.620]   chances are you're going to get some quality omega-3s.
[04:01:22.620 --> 04:01:25.540]   Omega-3s are also available in plant-based sources.
[04:01:25.540 --> 04:01:28.060]   It's also available in krill for that matter.
[04:01:28.060 --> 04:01:29.540]   But most people find it difficult
[04:01:29.540 --> 04:01:31.900]   to reach the threshold required
[04:01:31.900 --> 04:01:34.620]   for optimizing mental health and physical health.
[04:01:34.620 --> 04:01:37.720]   That is the threshold of the EPA essential fatty acids.
[04:01:37.720 --> 04:01:39.440]   And so for that matter,
[04:01:39.440 --> 04:01:41.420]   I've suggested before in this podcast
[04:01:41.420 --> 04:01:43.440]   and many fertility docs will suggest
[04:01:43.440 --> 04:01:47.360]   that their patients take omega-3 fatty acids
[04:01:47.360 --> 04:01:49.520]   in supplement form, it could be taken in liquid form
[04:01:49.520 --> 04:01:51.220]   or in capsule form, but enough of those
[04:01:51.220 --> 04:01:53.960]   so that you're getting at least one gram per day
[04:01:53.960 --> 04:01:56.380]   of the EPA form of omega-3s, okay?
[04:01:56.380 --> 04:01:57.780]   So at least one gram per day
[04:01:57.780 --> 04:02:00.380]   and as high as two or even three grams per day
[04:02:00.380 --> 04:02:01.860]   of the EPA form.
[04:02:01.860 --> 04:02:03.220]   So you'll need to look at the packaging
[04:02:03.220 --> 04:02:06.400]   because oftentimes you'll say high potency omega-3s,
[04:02:06.400 --> 04:02:10.000]   you'll say 1,500 milligrams of omega-3s,
[04:02:10.000 --> 04:02:13.220]   but that's not 1,500 milligrams of the EPA form.
[04:02:13.220 --> 04:02:15.140]   You look on the back of the label and you'll say,
[04:02:15.140 --> 04:02:18.780]   each serving contains 750 milligrams of EPA.
[04:02:18.780 --> 04:02:22.080]   You want to get above that one gram dosage per day
[04:02:22.080 --> 04:02:25.080]   and as high as three grams per day of the EPAs.
[04:02:25.080 --> 04:02:26.640]   The most cost-effective way to do that
[04:02:26.640 --> 04:02:28.900]   is going to be liquid form omegas,
[04:02:28.900 --> 04:02:30.720]   but that's a little bit inconvenient for many people
[04:02:30.720 --> 04:02:31.800]   and some people don't like the taste.
[04:02:31.800 --> 04:02:34.780]   That's why they rely on the capsule form omegas.
[04:02:34.780 --> 04:02:36.400]   And of course there are compounds
[04:02:36.400 --> 04:02:38.400]   that can impact fertility status,
[04:02:38.400 --> 04:02:40.640]   quality of eggs, quality of sperm,
[04:02:40.640 --> 04:02:44.180]   not by adjusting mitochondria or insulin sensitivity
[04:02:44.180 --> 04:02:47.080]   or creating a general milieu of support
[04:02:47.080 --> 04:02:50.580]   for the egg and the sperm production and function,
[04:02:50.580 --> 04:02:53.640]   such as the compounds that I just listed off do,
[04:02:53.640 --> 04:02:58.120]   but rather compounds that influence the hormones involved
[04:02:58.120 --> 04:03:00.680]   in the generation of sperm and the generation of the eggs
[04:03:00.680 --> 04:03:02.660]   involved in the ovulatory cycle
[04:03:02.660 --> 04:03:04.840]   and the spermatogenesis cycle that is.
[04:03:04.840 --> 04:03:07.440]   Now, these are going to come in different forms
[04:03:07.440 --> 04:03:10.640]   and I want to just emphasize that the supplements
[04:03:10.640 --> 04:03:12.760]   that do this, that adjust hormones in these ways
[04:03:12.760 --> 04:03:16.300]   that can be beneficial are distinct from hormone therapy
[04:03:16.300 --> 04:03:18.200]   or bioidentical hormones, okay?
[04:03:18.200 --> 04:03:20.860]   Distinct from hormone therapy or bioidentical hormones
[04:03:20.860 --> 04:03:22.840]   because as we discussed earlier,
[04:03:22.840 --> 04:03:25.120]   when you take a hormone like testosterone
[04:03:25.120 --> 04:03:26.460]   or even estrogen for that matter
[04:03:26.460 --> 04:03:28.440]   from an exogenous and outside source,
[04:03:28.440 --> 04:03:31.220]   you're going to disrupt the feedback pathways
[04:03:31.220 --> 04:03:32.120]   inside of your body
[04:03:32.120 --> 04:03:34.740]   and you're going to shut down your own endogenous production.
[04:03:34.740 --> 04:03:38.480]   The supplements I'm about to describe do not do that
[04:03:38.480 --> 04:03:41.680]   and yet can adjust levels of hormones in more subtle ways
[04:03:41.680 --> 04:03:44.440]   that could be beneficial for the process
[04:03:44.440 --> 04:03:47.920]   of maximizing fertility for males and for females.
[04:03:47.920 --> 04:03:50.280]   The first of which on this list that I'd like to discuss
[04:03:50.280 --> 04:03:52.220]   has been discussed in previous podcasts as well,
[04:03:52.220 --> 04:03:54.600]   which is a substance called tongkat ali.
[04:03:54.600 --> 04:03:57.400]   Tongkat ali also goes by other names,
[04:03:57.400 --> 04:03:59.960]   but when taken at 400 milligrams per day,
[04:03:59.960 --> 04:04:01.540]   sometimes separated into two dosages,
[04:04:01.540 --> 04:04:04.880]   but typically taken as once a day, early in the day,
[04:04:04.880 --> 04:04:07.780]   because it can be a little bit stimulating,
[04:04:07.780 --> 04:04:10.480]   although not anxiety provoking, I've never heard of that,
[04:04:10.480 --> 04:04:11.780]   can be a little bit stimulating,
[04:04:11.780 --> 04:04:13.640]   but 400 milligrams a day of tongkat ali
[04:04:13.640 --> 04:04:16.700]   has been shown to increase free testosterone
[04:04:16.700 --> 04:04:18.580]   by way of reducing something called sex hormone
[04:04:18.580 --> 04:04:19.420]   binding globulin.
[04:04:19.420 --> 04:04:21.960]   It's also been shown to increase luteinizing hormone,
[04:04:21.960 --> 04:04:25.920]   the net effect of which has been described as a subtle
[04:04:25.920 --> 04:04:28.800]   but significant increase in libido
[04:04:28.800 --> 04:04:30.360]   and some of the other parameters
[04:04:30.360 --> 04:04:32.360]   associated with increased androgens
[04:04:32.360 --> 04:04:34.520]   like free testosterone in males and females.
[04:04:34.520 --> 04:04:35.560]   So a number of people out there
[04:04:35.560 --> 04:04:36.960]   are taking tongkat ali in this way,
[04:04:36.960 --> 04:04:38.120]   400 milligrams per day,
[04:04:38.120 --> 04:04:42.520]   restricted to the early part of the day with or without food.
[04:04:42.520 --> 04:04:44.840]   People always ask, do you need to cycle tongkat ali?
[04:04:44.840 --> 04:04:47.020]   I'm not aware of any need to cycle tongkat ali.
[04:04:47.020 --> 04:04:48.680]   In fact, it tends to work better,
[04:04:48.680 --> 04:04:50.600]   meaning the effects on libido
[04:04:50.600 --> 04:04:53.880]   and some other hormone profiles tend to increase over time.
[04:04:53.880 --> 04:04:55.960]   Again, tongkat ali is an option,
[04:04:55.960 --> 04:04:58.440]   as certainly none of these things are requirements.
[04:04:58.440 --> 04:05:00.040]   We're simply listing off options,
[04:05:00.040 --> 04:05:02.320]   but many people, both males and females
[04:05:02.320 --> 04:05:05.360]   seem to benefit from and like tongkat ali,
[04:05:05.360 --> 04:05:07.640]   even if they're not seeking to conceive.
[04:05:07.640 --> 04:05:09.280]   There's no reason to think that tongkat ali
[04:05:09.280 --> 04:05:11.440]   directly improves egg or sperm quality,
[04:05:11.440 --> 04:05:13.680]   except in males, the increase in androgen
[04:05:13.680 --> 04:05:15.880]   created by tongkat ali supplementation
[04:05:15.880 --> 04:05:19.040]   can indeed lead to improved spermatogenesis.
[04:05:19.040 --> 04:05:20.800]   So there's a growing amount of data
[04:05:20.800 --> 04:05:22.680]   in the research literature on tongkat ali.
[04:05:22.680 --> 04:05:24.360]   Many people find it beneficial.
[04:05:24.360 --> 04:05:26.260]   And so it's something that both men and women
[04:05:26.260 --> 04:05:28.720]   wishing to conceive and or optimize their fertility
[04:05:28.720 --> 04:05:31.920]   just as a general health parameter might want to explore.
[04:05:31.920 --> 04:05:34.480]   The other supplement that's been shown to improve
[04:05:34.480 --> 04:05:37.600]   both egg quality and sperm quality,
[04:05:37.600 --> 04:05:41.040]   and there I'm referring to a number of different parameters
[04:05:41.040 --> 04:05:43.060]   related to egg quality and sperm quality,
[04:05:43.060 --> 04:05:47.060]   as well as to increase libido fairly substantially
[04:05:47.060 --> 04:05:48.860]   is a substance called shilajit.
[04:05:48.860 --> 04:05:53.520]   Shilajit spelled S-H-I-L-A-G-I-T.
[04:05:53.520 --> 04:05:56.880]   Shilajit is actually a compound
[04:05:56.880 --> 04:05:58.700]   that's used in Ayurvedic medicine,
[04:05:58.700 --> 04:06:00.700]   but there's some really good research studies
[04:06:00.700 --> 04:06:04.160]   exploring the supplementation with shilajit
[04:06:04.160 --> 04:06:06.960]   at about 250 milligrams twice per day.
[04:06:06.960 --> 04:06:09.640]   And this has been looked at in males and in females.
[04:06:09.640 --> 04:06:12.860]   It does seem to significantly increase two hormones.
[04:06:12.860 --> 04:06:14.520]   One is testosterone
[04:06:14.520 --> 04:06:17.480]   and the other is follicle stimulating hormone.
[04:06:17.480 --> 04:06:21.080]   And for that reason, shilajit is often considered a tonic
[04:06:21.080 --> 04:06:25.560]   that people use both as an aphrodisiac to increase libido,
[04:06:25.560 --> 04:06:28.200]   as well as to increase fertility.
[04:06:28.200 --> 04:06:30.000]   Now, one note of caution,
[04:06:30.000 --> 04:06:32.640]   if you're a woman and you're considering taking shilajit
[04:06:32.640 --> 04:06:34.080]   in order to increase testosterone
[04:06:34.080 --> 04:06:35.360]   and follicle stimulating hormone,
[04:06:35.360 --> 04:06:37.040]   keep in mind that the ovulatory cycle
[04:06:37.040 --> 04:06:40.280]   is this very tightly regulated cycle
[04:06:40.280 --> 04:06:43.880]   in which you want low but elevated levels
[04:06:43.880 --> 04:06:46.800]   of follicle stimulating hormone early in the follicular phase
[04:06:46.800 --> 04:06:48.760]   then it peaks right before ovulation
[04:06:48.760 --> 04:06:51.420]   and then low levels of follicle stimulating hormone
[04:06:51.420 --> 04:06:52.720]   in the second half of your cycle.
[04:06:52.720 --> 04:06:55.760]   For that reason, using shilajit chronically
[04:06:55.760 --> 04:06:58.960]   around the entire course of your ovulatory cycle
[04:06:58.960 --> 04:07:00.000]   could be a little bit risky.
[04:07:00.000 --> 04:07:03.260]   And I'd recommend that you talk to your OB/GYN
[04:07:03.260 --> 04:07:06.800]   prior to doing that or if doing that at all.
[04:07:06.800 --> 04:07:08.620]   For males, it's a little bit less of an issue
[04:07:08.620 --> 04:07:09.900]   because as I mentioned earlier,
[04:07:09.900 --> 04:07:11.760]   sperm are constantly being generated
[04:07:11.760 --> 04:07:13.840]   and the presence of FSH
[04:07:13.840 --> 04:07:16.320]   is going to increase spermatogenesis.
[04:07:16.320 --> 04:07:19.320]   Now, Shilajit is not FSH itself.
[04:07:19.320 --> 04:07:22.360]   Shilajit stimulates the release of FSH
[04:07:22.360 --> 04:07:24.560]   and it stimulates the release of testosterone.
[04:07:24.560 --> 04:07:25.700]   So again, there's no reason to think
[04:07:25.700 --> 04:07:27.880]   that it would shut down your endogenous testosterone
[04:07:27.880 --> 04:07:29.920]   or FSH production.
[04:07:29.920 --> 04:07:31.940]   Although there are limited amount of data
[04:07:31.940 --> 04:07:33.840]   that really explore that in detail.
[04:07:33.840 --> 04:07:36.960]   Many people use Shilajit in order to increase
[04:07:36.960 --> 04:07:39.880]   their testosterone FSH, their libido
[04:07:39.880 --> 04:07:43.800]   and various aspects of sperm health.
[04:07:43.800 --> 04:07:45.360]   Again, the dosages of Shilajit
[04:07:45.360 --> 04:07:47.580]   are about 250 milligrams, two times per day.
[04:07:47.580 --> 04:07:50.920]   One issue with Shilajit is it often comes as a tar.
[04:07:50.920 --> 04:07:52.960]   It was a little hard to measure out the dosages.
[04:07:52.960 --> 04:07:56.180]   Yes, a tar, it's this kind of thick gummy substance
[04:07:56.180 --> 04:07:57.800]   that you're supposed to dissolve in water.
[04:07:57.800 --> 04:07:59.640]   And the recommendations are you take a little bead
[04:07:59.640 --> 04:08:00.920]   and dissolve it in water.
[04:08:00.920 --> 04:08:03.120]   It is available in capsule form where the ability
[04:08:03.120 --> 04:08:06.880]   to control the dosage is made a little bit easier.
[04:08:06.880 --> 04:08:08.600]   But of course, as with any supplement,
[04:08:08.600 --> 04:08:11.040]   I recommend starting with the lowest possible dosage.
[04:08:11.040 --> 04:08:12.920]   So you might want to start with a small,
[04:08:12.920 --> 04:08:15.600]   very small bead of Shilajit dissolved in water,
[04:08:15.600 --> 04:08:18.820]   taken once per day, and then increase the dosage as needed
[04:08:18.820 --> 04:08:21.480]   in order to obtain the effects that you want.
[04:08:21.480 --> 04:08:24.040]   Things like Shilajit start to bring us into the realm
[04:08:24.040 --> 04:08:27.080]   of what can only be described as a little bit unwieldy.
[04:08:27.080 --> 04:08:28.960]   Here we're saying you can't really control the dosage.
[04:08:28.960 --> 04:08:30.120]   Now you're talking about hormones
[04:08:30.120 --> 04:08:31.520]   that need to be tightly regulated,
[04:08:31.520 --> 04:08:33.840]   at least for females across the ovarian cycle.
[04:08:33.840 --> 04:08:35.560]   For males, yes, it has been shown
[04:08:35.560 --> 04:08:37.760]   to increase testosterone and FSH,
[04:08:37.760 --> 04:08:40.840]   improve sperm motility and sperm count pretty significantly.
[04:08:40.840 --> 04:08:43.940]   No reason to think that you couldn't do that chronically
[04:08:43.940 --> 04:08:46.640]   with Shilajit, and yet I do want to acknowledge
[04:08:46.640 --> 04:08:49.480]   that Shilajit as this black tar substance
[04:08:49.480 --> 04:08:51.200]   contains a lot of different things.
[04:08:51.200 --> 04:08:53.080]   In fact, it comes from a mineral pitch.
[04:08:53.080 --> 04:08:53.920]   What is that?
[04:08:53.920 --> 04:08:56.160]   It comes from literally the dirt and plants
[04:08:56.160 --> 04:08:58.480]   that have been compressed by rocks in the Himalayas.
[04:08:58.480 --> 04:09:00.280]   So it was pretty esoteric stuff
[04:09:00.280 --> 04:09:01.400]   when it really comes down to it.
[04:09:01.400 --> 04:09:03.760]   But the biological effects of Shilajit
[04:09:03.760 --> 04:09:06.000]   in both males and females seem to be related
[04:09:06.000 --> 04:09:07.760]   to the fact that it is highly enriched
[04:09:07.760 --> 04:09:09.440]   in something called fulvic acid.
[04:09:09.440 --> 04:09:10.740]   And fulvic acid is involved
[04:09:10.740 --> 04:09:12.800]   in a lot of different cellular processes,
[04:09:12.800 --> 04:09:15.140]   not the least of which, at least in this context,
[04:09:15.140 --> 04:09:19.360]   is the transport of molecules across cell membranes.
[04:09:19.360 --> 04:09:20.880]   And for hormones to have their effect,
[04:09:20.880 --> 04:09:22.720]   they need to cross cell membranes on the outside
[04:09:22.720 --> 04:09:24.540]   and the inside of the cell.
[04:09:24.540 --> 04:09:26.340]   So maybe that's how it's having its effect.
[04:09:26.340 --> 04:09:29.380]   Again, the mechanisms of exactly how Shilajit
[04:09:29.380 --> 04:09:32.780]   increases testosterone in FSH and thereby libido,
[04:09:32.780 --> 04:09:35.280]   egg quality, and sperm quality aren't entirely clear,
[04:09:35.280 --> 04:09:38.300]   but for the more adventurous of you out there
[04:09:38.300 --> 04:09:39.540]   who want to experiment with Shilajit,
[04:09:39.540 --> 04:09:42.380]   whether or not you're trying to conceive or not,
[04:09:42.380 --> 04:09:43.820]   it might be something to consider,
[04:09:43.820 --> 04:09:45.720]   but of course, do talk to your physician.
[04:09:45.720 --> 04:09:48.860]   The next compound that I want to discuss is zinc.
[04:09:48.860 --> 04:09:51.260]   And then this discussion mainly pertains to males,
[04:09:51.260 --> 04:09:53.240]   although I, of course, should point out
[04:09:53.240 --> 04:09:56.700]   that females should get the recommended daily allowance
[04:09:56.700 --> 04:09:58.140]   of zinc each day.
[04:09:58.140 --> 04:10:00.560]   Males, on the other hand, seem to benefit
[04:10:00.560 --> 04:10:04.240]   from having additionally high levels of zinc intake.
[04:10:04.240 --> 04:10:05.840]   Now, that can be obtained through foods.
[04:10:05.840 --> 04:10:06.680]   You know, you often hear,
[04:10:06.680 --> 04:10:08.520]   oh, you know, oysters are enriched in zinc,
[04:10:08.520 --> 04:10:11.660]   and oysters are an aphrodisiac, you know.
[04:10:11.660 --> 04:10:13.300]   I don't know who's doing the marketing for oysters,
[04:10:13.300 --> 04:10:14.940]   but it's really terrific.
[04:10:14.940 --> 04:10:16.640]   I think that seems to have persisted.
[04:10:16.640 --> 04:10:21.160]   And maybe it's true, oysters are enriched in zinc.
[04:10:21.160 --> 04:10:23.700]   What does zinc do for fertility?
[04:10:23.700 --> 04:10:25.140]   Well, in males, we know,
[04:10:25.140 --> 04:10:27.600]   based on a really nice set of studies,
[04:10:27.600 --> 04:10:29.900]   that zinc dosages that are pretty high
[04:10:29.900 --> 04:10:33.500]   of about 120 milligrams taken twice per day,
[04:10:33.500 --> 04:10:35.920]   and that's quite a lot, with meals,
[04:10:35.920 --> 04:10:38.580]   can significantly increase testosterone
[04:10:38.580 --> 04:10:40.460]   and dihydrotestosterone.
[04:10:40.460 --> 04:10:42.700]   And this probably shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
[04:10:42.700 --> 04:10:46.520]   It turns out that zinc is highly enriched in human testes
[04:10:46.520 --> 04:10:48.060]   and in the testes of other animals,
[04:10:48.060 --> 04:10:49.820]   including fish and other mammals.
[04:10:49.820 --> 04:10:54.720]   It was actually in 1921 that it was observed in fish
[04:10:54.720 --> 04:10:58.560]   that zinc levels skyrocket in the testes of fish
[04:10:58.560 --> 04:10:59.880]   during their breeding season.
[04:10:59.880 --> 04:11:03.080]   So zinc is correlated with increases in breeding,
[04:11:03.080 --> 04:11:04.340]   but you never know which direction
[04:11:04.340 --> 04:11:05.860]   that correlation is running.
[04:11:05.860 --> 04:11:09.460]   Turns out that zinc in both animals,
[04:11:09.460 --> 04:11:12.380]   including fish, other mammals, and in humans,
[04:11:12.380 --> 04:11:15.500]   strongly impacts the enzymatic functions in the testes,
[04:11:15.500 --> 04:11:18.820]   including the function of androgen binding protein.
[04:11:18.820 --> 04:11:20.340]   So it seems that high levels of zinc
[04:11:20.340 --> 04:11:21.920]   can increase spermatogenesis
[04:11:21.920 --> 04:11:25.140]   and testosterone levels very significantly.
[04:11:25.140 --> 04:11:26.820]   This was explored in a really nice study
[04:11:26.820 --> 04:11:27.840]   that I'll provide a reference to.
[04:11:27.840 --> 04:11:29.520]   It's an older study, but I really like it.
[04:11:29.520 --> 04:11:31.160]   It's called "Effect of Zinc Administration
[04:11:31.160 --> 04:11:34.740]   on Plasma Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, and Sperm Count."
[04:11:34.740 --> 04:11:38.140]   This is but just one study among many now.
[04:11:38.140 --> 04:11:39.960]   This dates back to 1981,
[04:11:39.960 --> 04:11:42.220]   but there've been studies subsequently
[04:11:42.220 --> 04:11:44.140]   that point to the fact that supplementation with zinc
[04:11:44.140 --> 04:11:46.940]   at those high levels can really be helpful
[04:11:46.940 --> 04:11:50.640]   in terms of increasing sperm count, testosterone,
[04:11:50.640 --> 04:11:53.060]   and even testicular size of all things.
[04:11:53.060 --> 04:11:56.120]   So one important point about taking zinc,
[04:11:56.120 --> 04:11:59.220]   this 120 milligrams of zinc two times daily
[04:11:59.220 --> 04:12:00.780]   definitely needs to be done with meals.
[04:12:00.780 --> 04:12:02.860]   If you've ever taken zinc on an empty stomach,
[04:12:02.860 --> 04:12:05.540]   even if you just take 15 or 30 milligrams of zinc,
[04:12:05.540 --> 04:12:09.120]   you can feel very nauseous, not well for a few hours.
[04:12:09.120 --> 04:12:11.820]   So make sure that you're taking zinc with full meals.
[04:12:11.820 --> 04:12:14.020]   So this would mean that you're taking
[04:12:14.020 --> 04:12:16.860]   in at least two full meals per day.
[04:12:16.860 --> 04:12:19.700]   I should also mention that zinc supplementation
[04:12:19.700 --> 04:12:23.160]   did not appear to impact gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[04:12:23.160 --> 04:12:26.340]   or prolactin, so it seems to be a fairly targeted effect
[04:12:26.340 --> 04:12:28.840]   on the testosterone and related pathways in males.
[04:12:28.840 --> 04:12:31.280]   As far as I know, there have not been systematic
[04:12:31.280 --> 04:12:33.780]   explorations of the effects of high levels
[04:12:33.780 --> 04:12:35.580]   of zinc administration on females.
[04:12:35.580 --> 04:12:37.580]   I would hope that those studies would soon be done.
[04:12:37.580 --> 04:12:39.040]   But meanwhile, if you're a male
[04:12:39.040 --> 04:12:40.900]   and you're interested in improving sperm quality
[04:12:40.900 --> 04:12:44.020]   and your testosterone levels overall for whatever reason,
[04:12:44.020 --> 04:12:46.060]   zinc likely is a good candidate.
[04:12:46.060 --> 04:12:48.260]   And that pretty much summarizes the compounds
[04:12:48.260 --> 04:12:49.900]   that men and women should take
[04:12:49.900 --> 04:12:51.740]   in order to maximize egg quality,
[04:12:51.740 --> 04:12:53.500]   sperm quality, and fertility.
[04:12:53.500 --> 04:12:55.380]   And then of course, we start to enter the landscape
[04:12:55.380 --> 04:12:57.460]   of other things that men and women can take
[04:12:57.460 --> 04:12:58.740]   in order to improve fertility.
[04:12:58.740 --> 04:13:02.400]   And those other things generally are prescription drugs.
[04:13:02.400 --> 04:13:05.140]   And so I just want to mention what a few of those are,
[04:13:05.140 --> 04:13:07.140]   but of course, these are things that you would absolutely
[04:13:07.140 --> 04:13:11.140]   have to obtain prescriptions for from your MD.
[04:13:11.140 --> 04:13:14.080]   And your MD would, without question,
[04:13:14.080 --> 04:13:16.480]   would want to take blood tests prior to prescribing
[04:13:16.480 --> 04:13:17.320]   these things.
[04:13:17.320 --> 04:13:20.000]   So for instance, if men have been taking
[04:13:20.000 --> 04:13:23.180]   exogenous testosterone through the use of anabolic steroids,
[04:13:23.180 --> 04:13:24.540]   like performance enhancing drugs,
[04:13:24.540 --> 04:13:26.560]   or even testosterone replacement therapy,
[04:13:26.560 --> 04:13:28.160]   their endogenous testosterone levels
[04:13:28.160 --> 04:13:29.200]   are going to be very low,
[04:13:29.200 --> 04:13:31.220]   and their sperm counts are going to be very low,
[04:13:31.220 --> 04:13:32.980]   unless for instance, they are prescribed
[04:13:32.980 --> 04:13:37.020]   in taking something like HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,
[04:13:37.020 --> 04:13:39.760]   which mimics LH and would stimulate the testes
[04:13:39.760 --> 04:13:42.760]   to produce testosterone and through some indirect pathways,
[04:13:42.760 --> 04:13:45.900]   rescue spermatogenesis, although not to the same degree
[04:13:45.900 --> 04:13:49.060]   as if people are not taking exogenous sources
[04:13:49.060 --> 04:13:50.360]   of testosterone.
[04:13:50.360 --> 04:13:53.420]   Some men, even if they've never touched TRT
[04:13:53.420 --> 04:13:56.200]   or exogenous testosterone of any kind,
[04:13:56.200 --> 04:13:59.560]   will be prescribed to take HCG because of its ability
[04:13:59.560 --> 04:14:02.060]   to stimulate the testes to produce more testosterone
[04:14:02.060 --> 04:14:04.660]   and sperm, so they're just taking HCG alone.
[04:14:04.660 --> 04:14:07.980]   Other men will take, or will be prescribed rather, FSH
[04:14:07.980 --> 04:14:11.820]   in order to stimulate spermatogenesis, or HCG and FSH,
[04:14:11.820 --> 04:14:14.900]   or clomiphene, which can regulate all sorts of things
[04:14:14.900 --> 04:14:17.680]   in the both testosterone and estrogen-related pathways
[04:14:17.680 --> 04:14:22.680]   at the level of brain and pituitary and gonad testes.
[04:14:22.680 --> 04:14:25.780]   Likewise for women, if they're low in FSH,
[04:14:25.780 --> 04:14:27.860]   they might be prescribed FSH.
[04:14:27.860 --> 04:14:30.620]   If they are low in luteinizing hormone,
[04:14:30.620 --> 04:14:32.100]   they might be prescribed HCG.
[04:14:32.100 --> 04:14:33.200]   If they're low in testosterone,
[04:14:33.200 --> 04:14:34.820]   they might even be prescribed testosterone,
[04:14:34.820 --> 04:14:36.380]   and if their testosterone is too high
[04:14:36.380 --> 04:14:37.700]   and they're dealing with PCOS,
[04:14:37.700 --> 04:14:41.900]   they might be prescribed anti-androgens and androgen blockers
[04:14:41.900 --> 04:14:43.280]   and on and on and on.
[04:14:43.280 --> 04:14:45.100]   There are so many different hormones
[04:14:45.100 --> 04:14:47.580]   that can impact the different aspects of the ovulatory
[04:14:47.580 --> 04:14:51.940]   and the spermatogenesis cycle that the OB-GYNs
[04:14:51.940 --> 04:14:54.660]   and the urologists focus on male fertility nowadays
[04:14:54.660 --> 04:14:57.340]   really have an excellent handle on which levers
[04:14:57.340 --> 04:15:00.020]   and buttons and threads to pull and push and so forth
[04:15:00.020 --> 04:15:03.460]   in order to set in motion a proper ovulatory cycle
[04:15:03.460 --> 04:15:06.060]   and a proper spermatogenesis cycle.
[04:15:06.060 --> 04:15:08.160]   Everything we talked about up until now
[04:15:08.160 --> 04:15:09.800]   and in the early phase of this episode,
[04:15:09.800 --> 04:15:13.620]   especially about how the brain commands the pituitary
[04:15:13.620 --> 04:15:15.580]   and the pituitary commands the gonads,
[04:15:15.580 --> 04:15:17.760]   and then the gonads, the ovary or the testes,
[04:15:17.760 --> 04:15:19.940]   send feedback signals to the pituitary
[04:15:19.940 --> 04:15:21.600]   to then influence the pituitary.
[04:15:21.600 --> 04:15:24.520]   All of that incredible orchestra, that dance,
[04:15:24.520 --> 04:15:27.940]   is so tightly regulated in a way that really provides
[04:15:27.940 --> 04:15:29.940]   the OB-GYNs and the fertility docs
[04:15:29.940 --> 04:15:33.020]   concerned with male fertility exceptional tools
[04:15:33.020 --> 04:15:35.060]   to, for instance, figure out if a man
[04:15:35.060 --> 04:15:38.380]   is not producing any sperm, but his testosterone levels
[04:15:38.380 --> 04:15:40.220]   are well within normal range.
[04:15:40.220 --> 04:15:43.100]   Well, then there's some very clear sets of explorations
[04:15:43.100 --> 04:15:45.060]   and potential treatments, some of which are mechanical,
[04:15:45.060 --> 04:15:47.660]   making sure the epididymis and vas deferens are clear,
[04:15:47.660 --> 04:15:49.780]   allowing the sperm to enter the ejaculate
[04:15:49.780 --> 04:15:51.420]   and the ejaculate to enter the urethra
[04:15:51.420 --> 04:15:54.160]   and obviously to enter the female,
[04:15:54.160 --> 04:15:57.980]   as well as for a woman who's not ovulating
[04:15:57.980 --> 04:16:00.020]   to adjust her levels of FSH
[04:16:00.020 --> 04:16:03.300]   or maybe even to apply acupuncture in conjunction
[04:16:03.300 --> 04:16:05.900]   with supplementation and various prescription
[04:16:05.900 --> 04:16:09.300]   hormone therapies to adjust fertility and ovulation
[04:16:09.300 --> 04:16:11.860]   and the probability of successful pregnancy.
[04:16:11.860 --> 04:16:14.520]   So there's a vast landscape of prescription drugs
[04:16:14.520 --> 04:16:17.380]   and surgical interventions of varying degrees
[04:16:17.380 --> 04:16:21.500]   of invasiveness, and some are, for instance,
[04:16:21.500 --> 04:16:24.780]   outpatient procedures, some require general anesthesia,
[04:16:24.780 --> 04:16:28.480]   et cetera, in order to maximize male and female fertility.
[04:16:28.480 --> 04:16:31.900]   What I've tried to do today is to provide you
[04:16:31.900 --> 04:16:34.980]   with a deep dive understanding
[04:16:34.980 --> 04:16:36.740]   of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle.
[04:16:36.740 --> 04:16:38.180]   We talked about the brain, the pituitary,
[04:16:38.180 --> 04:16:39.540]   the ovary, the fallopian tubes,
[04:16:39.540 --> 04:16:41.860]   and in fact, the whole female reproductive axis
[04:16:41.860 --> 04:16:46.080]   as it relates to fertility and reproduction.
[04:16:46.080 --> 04:16:49.900]   I also describe the male reproductive axis
[04:16:49.900 --> 04:16:51.780]   as it relates to the brain, the pituitary,
[04:16:51.780 --> 04:16:54.540]   the gonad, the testes, and the various ducts,
[04:16:54.540 --> 04:16:58.240]   the pathways out of the testes that allow the sperm
[04:16:58.240 --> 04:17:01.600]   to be enriched within the semen and then the semen
[04:17:01.600 --> 04:17:04.200]   and the ejaculate to exit through the urethra.
[04:17:04.200 --> 04:17:06.800]   I did all that as a way to frame the various tools
[04:17:06.800 --> 04:17:09.640]   and interventions that can really assist
[04:17:09.640 --> 04:17:13.380]   in increasing fertility, egg quality, and sperm quality.
[04:17:13.380 --> 04:17:15.540]   So when we discuss mitochondria in the context
[04:17:15.540 --> 04:17:18.580]   of the development of an egg or the development of sperm
[04:17:18.580 --> 04:17:21.860]   and its ability to swim quickly forward,
[04:17:21.860 --> 04:17:24.520]   now it should make sense as to why a given intervention,
[04:17:24.520 --> 04:17:26.780]   whether or not it's L-carnitine or whether or not
[04:17:26.780 --> 04:17:28.820]   it's exercise or whether or not it's getting enough sleep
[04:17:28.820 --> 04:17:30.860]   and limiting stress, why all that should matter,
[04:17:30.860 --> 04:17:32.940]   and why, in fact, mechanistically,
[04:17:32.940 --> 04:17:34.860]   those interventions can work.
[04:17:34.860 --> 04:17:36.600]   Because indeed there are many interventions
[04:17:36.600 --> 04:17:40.300]   that we can all do and use to support our fertility.
[04:17:40.300 --> 04:17:42.620]   And again, as a more general theme today,
[04:17:42.620 --> 04:17:44.460]   I really wanted to A, teach you
[04:17:44.460 --> 04:17:46.620]   about the human reproductive axis.
[04:17:46.620 --> 04:17:50.180]   I do find the biology of the ovulatory and menstrual cycle
[04:17:50.180 --> 04:17:53.380]   and spermatogenesis to be absolutely fascinating to me.
[04:17:53.380 --> 04:17:55.820]   And again, if you're somebody who's interested in conceiving
[04:17:55.820 --> 04:17:57.680]   or if you've already conceived children,
[04:17:57.680 --> 04:17:59.780]   and even if you don't want more children,
[04:17:59.780 --> 04:18:02.200]   this is really the aspect of our biology
[04:18:02.200 --> 04:18:04.420]   that allowed us to be here.
[04:18:04.420 --> 04:18:07.060]   It's the aspect of our biology that determined
[04:18:07.060 --> 04:18:09.060]   whether or not we are male or female.
[04:18:09.060 --> 04:18:11.700]   It's the aspect of our biology that determines so, so much,
[04:18:11.700 --> 04:18:13.620]   and yet I think that most of us
[04:18:13.620 --> 04:18:15.720]   generally are not taught this in school,
[04:18:15.720 --> 04:18:18.380]   or at least not at the depth that we discussed it today.
[04:18:18.380 --> 04:18:21.060]   So hopefully that information was in and of itself
[04:18:21.060 --> 04:18:23.260]   interesting and perhaps useful as well.
[04:18:23.260 --> 04:18:25.440]   And I do think that even if people are not wishing
[04:18:25.440 --> 04:18:27.060]   to conceive more children,
[04:18:27.060 --> 04:18:28.980]   that the information related to fertility
[04:18:28.980 --> 04:18:32.020]   and optimizing egg and sperm health is of value
[04:18:32.020 --> 04:18:35.260]   in the sense that optimizing egg and sperm health
[04:18:35.260 --> 04:18:37.940]   can be used as a proxy for optimizing
[04:18:37.940 --> 04:18:39.740]   our body and brain health generally.
[04:18:39.740 --> 04:18:43.820]   In other words, and here I'm admittedly taking words
[04:18:43.820 --> 04:18:46.820]   out of the mouths of the various wonderful doctors,
[04:18:46.820 --> 04:18:50.300]   the OBGYNs and urologists that helped inform me
[04:18:50.300 --> 04:18:52.140]   in anticipation of this episode,
[04:18:52.140 --> 04:18:55.000]   what is good for the woman is good for the egg
[04:18:55.000 --> 04:18:57.020]   and for fertility and for her pregnancy.
[04:18:57.020 --> 04:19:01.460]   And what's good for the man is good for the quality
[04:19:01.460 --> 04:19:05.680]   and production of sperm and for fertility and pregnancy.
[04:19:05.680 --> 04:19:08.900]   Put differently, whether or not we are male or female,
[04:19:08.900 --> 04:19:11.700]   the things that we can do to optimize our fertility
[04:19:11.700 --> 04:19:14.700]   are the exact same things that we should all be doing
[04:19:14.700 --> 04:19:17.500]   to optimize our vitality and our longevity.
[04:19:17.500 --> 04:19:20.540]   And I realized today's episode was so much the deep dive
[04:19:20.540 --> 04:19:22.300]   and fairly broad as well,
[04:19:22.300 --> 04:19:25.220]   that it ended up being fairly long and extensive.
[04:19:25.220 --> 04:19:27.580]   And yet we still have not touched
[04:19:27.580 --> 04:19:28.980]   on any of the important themes
[04:19:28.980 --> 04:19:30.980]   that I know a number of people want to know about.
[04:19:30.980 --> 04:19:35.980]   So for instance, menopause, andropause, PCOS,
[04:19:35.980 --> 04:19:37.700]   and other themes related to hormones
[04:19:37.700 --> 04:19:39.340]   and reproductive function in biology.
[04:19:39.340 --> 04:19:41.380]   And I promise that we will have episodes,
[04:19:41.380 --> 04:19:44.840]   both solo episodes and episodes with expert guests
[04:19:44.840 --> 04:19:47.380]   in the future to cover all of those topics in detail.
[04:19:47.380 --> 04:19:50.180]   Meanwhile, the information discussed in today's episode
[04:19:50.180 --> 04:19:52.460]   should serve as a basic foundation
[04:19:52.460 --> 04:19:54.020]   for those discussions going forward.
[04:19:54.020 --> 04:19:56.500]   And hopefully we're of interest to you in their own right.

[04:20:18.100 --> 04:20:20.220]   I do read all the comments.
[04:20:20.220 --> 04:20:22.740]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[04:20:22.740 --> 04:20:24.700]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[04:20:24.700 --> 04:20:27.200]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[04:20:27.200 --> 04:20:29.560]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[04:20:29.560 --> 04:20:32.080]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.
[04:20:32.080 --> 04:20:34.220]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[04:20:34.220 --> 04:20:36.220]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[04:20:36.220 --> 04:20:38.220]   for things like sleep, hormone augmentation,
[04:20:38.220 --> 04:20:39.960]   focus, and much more.
[04:20:39.960 --> 04:20:41.700]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[04:20:41.700 --> 04:20:43.240]   with Momentous Supplements,
[04:20:43.240 --> 04:20:45.540]   because as mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[04:20:45.540 --> 04:20:48.060]   Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality,
[04:20:48.060 --> 04:20:49.360]   they ship internationally,
[04:20:49.360 --> 04:20:51.780]   and they have single ingredient formulations
[04:20:51.780 --> 04:20:54.460]   that allow you to develop the most biologically effective
[04:20:54.460 --> 04:20:57.100]   and cost-effective supplement regimen for you.
[04:20:57.100 --> 04:20:59.340]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed on today's
[04:20:59.340 --> 04:21:01.100]   and other Huberman Lab Podcasts,
[04:21:01.100 --> 04:21:03.340]   please go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[04:21:03.340 --> 04:21:06.480]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[04:21:06.480 --> 04:21:08.880]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[04:21:08.880 --> 04:21:09.720]   please do so.
[04:21:09.720 --> 04:21:11.660]   We are @hubermanlab on Instagram, Twitter,
[04:21:11.660 --> 04:21:13.020]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[04:21:13.020 --> 04:21:14.340]   And at all of those places,
[04:21:14.340 --> 04:21:16.500]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[04:21:16.500 --> 04:21:18.160]   some of which overlap with the contents
[04:21:18.160 --> 04:21:19.320]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[04:21:19.320 --> 04:21:20.980]   but much of which is distinct
[04:21:20.980 --> 04:21:22.740]   from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[04:21:22.740 --> 04:21:25.980]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[04:21:25.980 --> 04:21:28.060]   And if you haven't already subscribed to our newsletter,
[04:21:28.060 --> 04:21:30.220]   we have a zero-cost newsletter.
[04:21:30.220 --> 04:21:32.000]   It is called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[04:21:32.000 --> 04:21:35.820]   And each month, it includes things like podcast summaries
[04:21:35.820 --> 04:21:38.060]   and toolkits for things like sleep, focus,
[04:21:38.060 --> 04:21:41.420]   dopamine optimization, fitness, and so on.
[04:21:41.420 --> 04:21:43.060]   You can sign up for the newsletter, again,
[04:21:43.060 --> 04:21:45.460]   completely zero cost by going to hubermanlab.com,
[04:21:45.460 --> 04:21:47.200]   go to the menu, go to newsletter.
[04:21:47.200 --> 04:21:49.560]   You provide your email and we do not share your email.
[04:21:49.560 --> 04:21:52.060]   And again, the newsletter is completely zero cost.
[04:21:52.060 --> 04:21:54.560]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[04:21:54.560 --> 04:21:57.380]   all about the biology surrounding this incredible thing
[04:21:57.380 --> 04:21:58.360]   that we call fertility,
[04:21:58.360 --> 04:22:01.280]   including the ovulatory cycle, spermatogenesis,
[04:22:01.280 --> 04:22:02.680]   fertilization itself,
[04:22:02.680 --> 04:22:05.540]   and all the events leading up to pregnancy.
[04:22:05.540 --> 04:22:07.680]   And last, but certainly not least,
[04:22:07.680 --> 04:22:09.440]   thank you for your interest in science.
[04:22:09.440 --> 04:22:12.020]   [upbeat music]
[04:22:12.020 --> 04:22:14.600]   (upbeat music)
