[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   I would invite your attention once more to the words that are to be found in the eighth
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:20.800]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, in verses 26 and 27.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.400]   Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.360]   we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.840]   And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.880]   intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.280]   Now we begin our consideration of this statement, because the two verses constitute one statement.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.360]   Last Friday evening, and we took it from this angle in standpoint, that the apostle here
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.520]   is proceeding to tell us a further work that is done by the Holy Spirit in this matter
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   of giving us assurance and certainty of our final and complete salvation in and through
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.000]   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.200]   And the way in which he puts it is this.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.960]   He has already reminded us that in this life we are still in the body, and because of that
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.520]   that we are subject to certain infirmities.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.040]   And because of these infirmities, because we are not yet perfect, not yet glorified,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.320]   we find ourselves in various difficulties.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:57.040]   But in particular, he takes up one aspect of our infirmity, and that is the aspect concerned
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:06.240]   with this whole question of prayer, and in particular, what exactly to pray for in certain
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.000]   given situations.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   Now you remember we emphasized that.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.520]   We know not, he says, the what we should pray for as is convenient, or as is right, or as
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.280]   is appropriate in any given circumstances in which we may find ourselves.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.080]   Now it's important that we should bear in mind that that is what the apostle is dealing
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   with.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.120]   He really is not dealing with the question of prayer in general.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.640]   He's dealing with this peculiar situation in which we all as Christians must have found
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.040]   ourselves many times when in a given position, in a given set of circumstances, we have really
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   not known exactly what to pray for.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   We know how to pray.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.300]   We know how to pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, relying upon his shed blood.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.840]   That isn't the difficulty.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.320]   The difficulty is the what, the exact thing, the appropriate thing to pray for in these
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.840]   particularly difficult and trying circumstances.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.640]   And we have seen, furthermore, that we are very well advised to be very careful at that
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.360]   point.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.400]   We looked at illustrations out of the life of Moses and even of this apostle Paul himself,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.960]   when they prayed for the wrong thing, and came afterwards to realize that they had been
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.300]   praying for the wrong thing.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.360]   So if men like that can go astray at this point, how much more so can we?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   Very well.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.400]   Now, we left off at that particular point.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.920]   We saw, therefore, the need for caution, for carefulness, the need not to rush in, in a
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.360]   wrong manner, into the presence of God, and the advisability of being ready to admit in
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.700]   these peculiar circumstances that we are in a condition of perplexity.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.320]   Very well, we have arrived at that point, but now we must continue with our consideration.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.160]   And thank God that we can do so, because here we are given very great and very wonderful
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   comfort.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.840]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.000]   Let me try to put to you the argument of the apostle in these two verses as I see it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.220]   I start, therefore, with a statement to this effect, that we should not be discouraged
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.580]   by these difficulties which arise out of our infirmity.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.020]   We shouldn't be discouraged by that.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   Why not?
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.340]   Well, the first reason is this.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.600]   This is not something that is sinful in and of itself.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.500]   It is something, as we saw, that results from our sinful state and condition.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.860]   It is one of the consequences of the fall of man at the beginning, and the coming of
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.620]   sin into man's life.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.700]   The infirmity arises out of that.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.680]   The infirmity, I say, itself is not of necessity sinful, and that's a great comfort.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.140]   We shouldn't feel that we have committed an act of sin because we don't know at any
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.660]   given moment what to pray for.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.460]   It is a part of our general infirmity, and not in and of itself sinful.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.780]   Now, I say that that's a comfort in and of itself.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.640]   Or let me put it like this.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.740]   The mere fact that you sometimes find yourself in a situation in which you don't quite
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.500]   know what to pray for as you ought, is not a sign that you are not one of God's children.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   Now the devil will come and suggest that immediately.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.780]   He'll say, "Ah, here you are.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.880]   You don't know what to pray for.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.420]   You mustn't call yourself a child of God.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.800]   You were a child of God, you wouldn't be in this sort of difficulty.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.580]   As a child with his father, you'd always know what to ask for.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.060]   But you see, you don't know.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.060]   You're ignorant.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.060]   You're in perplexity.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.260]   The fact is that you're not a child of God at all.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.220]   Now I say the teaching here is that that's quite wrong, and that that is nothing but
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.940]   the suggestion of the devil who's trying to rob us of some of the joy in our Christian
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.640]   life and experience.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.900]   So I put it in the third form like this.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.380]   Far from this kind of infirmity which renders us incapable of knowing exactly what we should
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:37.700]   pray for as we ought, far from this proving that we are not God's children, it can indeed,
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.060]   if we only listen to this teaching, lead to a most wonderful proof of the fact that we
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.540]   are God's children.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.060]   And I suggest to you that that is what the apostle is telling us here.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.220]   That this infirmity of ours in this particular matter, if we only handle it properly and
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.580]   if we only regard it properly, will turn out in the end, far from being a discouragement,
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:11.580]   to be an additional proof of the certainty of the fact that we are the children of God
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.120]   and that our ultimate salvation is assured.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.800]   Now then, how does this work out?
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.760]   Well, let's look at it in this way.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.980]   My second heading, therefore, would be this.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:30.340]   How this infirmity is turned into a proof of our son-ship.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.340]   That's the theme.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.020]   How does it happen?
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.940]   Well the first thing, of course, is that we are reminded that the Spirit, the Spirit himself
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.100]   – I needn't stay with this – here in the Authorized Version it is the Spirit itself.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:51.140]   We've had to deal with that many times already in working through this epistle, and we know
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.060]   that there's a mere technical, linguistic reason for this neuter.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.020]   It doesn't make any difference at all, and taking it in the light of all the teaching
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:07.940]   everywhere about the Holy Spirit, we read the Spirit and the Spirit himself.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.100]   Now then, here is an immediate source of comfort.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:17.460]   In this situation of ours, in this perplexity that results from our infirmity, the Spirit
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.020]   comes in.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:25.060]   The Holy Spirit of God does something, and there is the key to the whole doctrine and
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.140]   to the understanding of this wonderful encouragement that we are given here.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.260]   It is a further action of the Spirit.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.300]   Likewise, the Spirit also, in addition to the other things, also does this particular
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.300]   thing.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.740]   Now then, what does he do here?
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.380]   What is this peculiar something he does in this exact situation?
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.500]   Well the word used is "help him."
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   Likewise the Spirit also "helpeth" our infirmities.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.300]   Now this is a most wonderful word, this word translated here by "helpeth," and I want
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   to bring out its meaning.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.140]   It is a compound word.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.660]   The Apostle used a word that is made up of three words, and each one of the three is
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.420]   very important in the understanding of this matter.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.740]   The first is "together."
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.900]   It is the same word as you get in "symphony."
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.340]   The first part of the word "symphony," meaning "together."
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.300]   The second word means "over against."
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.900]   Together over against, and the third word means "to take."
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.920]   It means, therefore, you see, that you've got two people taking something over against
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   one another.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.340]   Together, over against, to take.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.300]   So it means this.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:56.100]   It means one person giving a helping hand to another by taking hold over against that
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.980]   person the load that he's carrying.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.580]   The picture is a clear one, isn't it?
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.100]   Here's a man struggling under some heavy load which he is carrying, and he's almost
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.100]   collapsing.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.740]   Suddenly somebody comes along and says, "Wait a minute.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.820]   Let me get hold of that other end for you."
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.140]   So instead of the man having to carry the whole thing himself, the other one that comes
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.500]   along takes hold of the other end, and now they together proceed to carry this load that
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.740]   was too much for the one man on his own.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.180]   That's the picture.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.020]   And that's the exact word which the apostle used here, this composite, compound word which
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.500]   he makes up of those three words in that way.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.380]   Now that's what the Spirit does, he says.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:46.060]   But now we've got another very good illustration of the exact meaning of this word in an incident
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.940]   in the Gospels which is very familiar to you.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:55.460]   We go to the famous incident about Mary and Martha at the end of the 10th chapter of Luke's
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.460]   Gospel.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.420]   Verse 38, "It came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village, and
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.020]   a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:10.700]   She had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:17.140]   But Martha was cumbered about much certain, and came to him and said, 'Lord, dost thou
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.900]   not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.700]   Bid her therefore that she help me.'
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.680]   Exactly the same word.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.300]   What she said was, 'Bid my sister that she give me a helping hand in this matter.'
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.500]   My sister, she says, is letting me do it all.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.860]   She's sitting there listening to you, I've got to do everything.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.340]   I've got to do the cooking and carry it in from the kitchen into this room.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.340]   I'm doing it.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.780]   Why don't you tell my sister to give me a helping hand?
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.680]   Why don't you ask my sister to share this burden with me?
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.580]   Why don't you ask her to take this thing up with me, so that the two of us together can
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.580]   handle it?'
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:12:00.780]   It is the precise word that we are dealing with here in verse 26.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:06.380]   Now that I think brings out the rich meaning of this word that is here used.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.500]   We are carrying this burden.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.500]   We don't know what to do.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:15.460]   Ah, the Spirit comes in, gives us a helping hand, takes hold of the burden with us as
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.420]   it were, in order to help us to do this very thing.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.060]   Now let me give you another parallel statement of the same thing.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.840]   It's the same idea.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.980]   You remember our Lord's gracious invitation recorded at the end of the eleventh chapter
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.940]   of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:41.340]   'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:51.060]   Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.'
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.940]   Now the whole picture there you see is of two oxen yoked together.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.260]   Here is a load being drawn, and what our Lord is saying is this.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.100]   You are weary, you are heavy laden, and you are labouring because the Lord is too much
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.100]   for you.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.300]   He says now then, what I am offering is that you be yoked to me.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.500]   And as you are yoked to me, we will do this together, and you will find then that it is
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.220]   easy, that the Lord which is so heavy becomes light.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:23.200]   It's precisely the same idea as we are taught here about the work of the Spirit in helping
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.140]   our infirmity at this point.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.700]   Now then notice in passing that we are not told that the Spirit is going to do everything
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.900]   for us and we've got nothing to do at all.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   That isn't what we are told.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.660]   The Spirit helps us.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.540]   He doesn't take the whole of the burden from us.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.580]   No, what he does is to take up the other end of it.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.420]   If you like, think of a man carrying a very heavy log or a plank, and it's just too
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.420]   much for him.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.620]   But the Spirit takes hold of the other end of the plank or the log and we carry it together.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.860]   He doesn't do it all for us.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.140]   This isn't passivity again, but he helpeth our infirmity, comes to our aid, gives us
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:04.900]   a helping hand, comes up over against us, takes hold together with us, and so together
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.620]   this thing is done.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.620]   Helpeth.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.780]   Now that leads us then to the next question.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   How the Spirit helps us in this way?
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.620]   What does he do exactly when he does that which we've been describing?
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.980]   Well the answer is that he does so by making intercession for us.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.100]   Now here again is another most interesting word.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.300]   Maketh intercession.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.300]   What does it mean?
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.660]   Well once more the real original meaning is this.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:42.940]   It means rescue by one who happens on one who is in trouble and in his behalf pleads.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.340]   In other words, here is a man walking along the road and suddenly he comes upon a poor
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.700]   man who is in trouble, who is being charged with something and is in great difficulties
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.380]   in trying to defend himself.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.140]   And this man who was walking along happens to come across this man in this terribly difficult
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:08.100]   position and he begins to plead on his behalf, either to his master who may be beating him
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:14.140]   or to the magistrate or to the king or whoever it was that had put this poor man into difficulties
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.460]   and into trouble.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.500]   He happens to come across him and he takes up his case and begins to plead for him.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   That's the meaning of the word.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.340]   Maketh intercession.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:31.520]   Again you see a most picturesque word which opens out great worlds of meaning for us immediately.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.740]   Now then, how does he do this?
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.100]   We must ask that question next.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.620]   This is the way to expound the Scripture.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.620]   We've been asking questions.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.300]   How does he do this?
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.220]   If that's the picture in your word, well how, what exactly does the Spirit do?
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.380]   Well, before we can answer that question we've got to deal with this phrase, "with groanings
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.460]   which cannot be uttered."
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.220]   With groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.020]   There's no difficulty about the groanings.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.380]   What's it mean to say, "with groanings which cannot be uttered"?
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.780]   Well the meaning of the word is a simple one, it means "without words."
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.620]   It means not formulated in words.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:19.800]   It's a groan or a sigh which is not formulated in words, is not given expression or form
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   in words.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:28.340]   Now, here I must indulge in a little argumentation because my argument is that it means nothing
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.220]   more than that.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.740]   And so many of the commentators read much more than that into it.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:41.620]   They read this into it, "Oh," they say, "these groanings, these sighings are so deep, so
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.660]   profound, so moving that they defy expression.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:53.100]   That the groanings that are within us are so marvelous in their profundity and in their
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.000]   depth that no words can possibly describe them."
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.900]   But I'm here to contend that that is really not the meaning at all and that that's forcing
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.900]   a meaning.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.100]   Now, they say that, of course, because the kind of word that is used here is used elsewhere
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.740]   in the scriptures to convey that kind of meaning and of impression.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.580]   Let me give you one or two examples.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.620]   Take for instance 2 Corinthians 9, the last verse, 15.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:28.020]   "Let's be unto God for his unspeakable gift."
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.060]   Well, of course, there it's quite right.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.500]   That's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   And he's unspeakable in this sense, that no words can ever describe him.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.460]   No words are adequate.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.060]   Every vocabulary is entirely exhausted.
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.780]   He is unspeakable, the unspeakable gift.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:55.300]   Or take a similar one in 2 Corinthians 12, and in the fourth verse, the apostle is describing
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.380]   his experience 14 years before when he knew such a man, "Whether in the body or out of
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.860]   the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth."
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:09.740]   How that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.740]   for a man to utter.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   Again, there's no difficulty.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:21.060]   He had a glimpse of heaven, and he heard something of the conversation, the language, and the
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.300]   music of heaven, of the glory.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.060]   And of course, there's only one thing to say about it.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.660]   It is unspeakable.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.140]   Human language is totally inadequate to describe what goes on in heaven.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.060]   That's why we are told so little about heaven in the Bible.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.340]   People often say, "Why aren't we told more about heaven?"
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.340]   That's the answer.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.220]   There is no language that you and I are aware of and can use and can understand, but that
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.020]   it would detract from the glory of heaven.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.020]   It's unspeakable.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.620]   So, never again wish that you knew a little bit more about heaven.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.900]   You can't know it, because anything that's said about it, as it were, is taking from
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   it.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   It's too glorious.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.900]   It's unspeakable.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.980]   Very well, it's the only adequate term to employ.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.060]   And then Peter uses a similar word in his first epistle, first chapter, verse 8.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:14.940]   He says, "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not yet believing,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.380]   ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.020]   It's the same thing again.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:28.580]   The Christian may know the Lord Jesus Christ in such a manner that he cannot find words
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.820]   to describe the rejoicing that he's aware of.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.300]   We all ought to be in that position.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.140]   Now, there again, it's the same meaning.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:42.820]   It is something so great, so vast, that words are inadequate to express it.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.020]   But it seems to me that that is not the meaning here, and I'm supported, of course, in this
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.860]   by the very word that the apostle used.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.820]   He didn't use the word that he uses in those other cases.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:59.900]   He used a word which simply means "not expressed in words," "wordless," with groanings which
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.140]   are wordless, or with wordless groanings.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.660]   All he wants to say is this.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.140]   Not that the feelings which we have are so profound and so deep that you can't give expression
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:16.780]   to them, but simply that we are in such perplexity that we can't say it.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.180]   We don't know.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:24.860]   It's just wordless, and I don't think we are entitled to read any deeper meaning into it.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.060]   Well, that's a part of our answer.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.340]   The Spirit maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.900]   We've now described the character of the groanings, that they're wordless.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.900]   But here's the question.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.900]   Who does the groaning?
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.660]   "Oh, but, sir, somebody that's quite obvious."
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.980]   He says the Spirit himself does it.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.620]   The Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.260]   There's no difficulty.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.260]   It's the Spirit.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.020]   But, my dear friend, that cannot be the case.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.900]   The Holy Spirit is one of the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.060]   He never groans.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060]   He never sighs.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.220]   No, no, it's impossible, it's inconceivable.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.220]   But you say, "Didn't our Lord groan?"
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.180]   Yes, but he groaned as a man.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.820]   That was the human part of him.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.820]   That was the part that was limited.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.940]   The Godhead doesn't groan.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.100]   It's inconceivable.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.500]   For every reason.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.700]   There's no lack of knowledge in the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   He knows all things.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.260]   He's the third person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.260]   There is no limit.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.260]   There is no lack.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.180]   There is no ignorance.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.100]   There is no cause for groaning.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:46.740]   So I say it is utterly inconceivable that it is the Holy Spirit himself who does the
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.740]   groaning.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.900]   Well, what happens then?
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.820]   Well, the answer is that the groaning is ours.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:59.260]   It is we who do the groaning in this wordless manner.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.300]   It is we who fail to find the words to express what is happening within us.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.540]   Now let me show you how justified this exposition is.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.180]   It's just the Apostle's mode of expression.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.900]   It's the way that he puts it.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.060]   Take the parallel, a very good parallel in this respect, in Galatians 4 and in verse
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.620]   6.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:29.500]   The Apostle says there, "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.780]   Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.300]   Now at first sight there again, you would think that the Apostle is saying that it is
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.900]   the Spirit who cries, "Abba, Father!"
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.660]   But again, of course, that is impossible.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.660]   The Spirit is not the Son of the Father.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.420]   The Spirit doesn't cry, "Abba, Father!" himself.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   What happens?
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   Well, what happens is this.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:01.140]   "God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, with the result that he
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.980]   makes you cry, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.580]   Well, now we've already seen that, of course, in the 15th verse of the chapter that we are
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.380]   already dealing with.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:15.140]   There we saw that we have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but we have
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:20.340]   received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father!"
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.420]   Now there it is right, but he's saying exactly the same thing.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.580]   It's the same meaning in Galatians 4.6, but he puts it in words there that might very
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.780]   well lead you to think that it was the Spirit that cries, "Abba, Father!"
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.820]   Here's the correct way.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:41.620]   The Spirit leads us to do this, but the cry, this elemental cry, "Abba, Father!" comes
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:48.300]   from us, produced by the Spirit, not uttered by the Spirit, but uttered by us.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:53.740]   That was why we were at such pains to show the difference between verses 15 and 16.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:59.500]   In verses 15, it is our Spirit that cries, "Abba, Father!" as the result, of course,
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.220]   of the operation of the Spirit.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:07.340]   But in verse 16, it is the Spirit himself who is bearing witness with our spirits that
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.660]   we are the children of God.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.660]   Very well then.
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:17.100]   Now then, we are beginning to see what he means when he says, "The Spirit maketh intercession
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.980]   for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.700]   This is how it happens.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:30.180]   The Spirit, as it were, comes across us in this difficulty.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.820]   Here we are, circumstances as such.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.900]   Because of our infirmity, we don't know what to pray for.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.020]   We are afraid to pray for the wrong thing.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.020]   We don't want to put up a wrong petition.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.660]   And we don't know what to do.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.740]   We are in this perplexity.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.620]   The Spirit comes to us at that point, comes upon us as the word puts it, you see.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.220]   And now he comes to us as an advocate.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.860]   And he begins to tell us what to pray for.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.980]   Now this is one of the functions of an advocate, isn't it?
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.500]   Take a man who's in trouble, he goes to his solicitor.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   This man's going to be on trial.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.500]   What does the advocate do?
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.380]   Well, he gives the man the answers he's got to give.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.460]   Now he says, "The magistrate will ask you this question and that question.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.260]   This is what you should say to him in reply."
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.220]   He prepares his case for him.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.700]   The poor man doesn't know what to say.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.540]   All he knows is he's at a thumbnail.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.180]   He's got to appear in that court.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.180]   He says, "What shall I say?
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.180]   How shall I answer?
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.180]   I don't know what to say to this charge."
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.740]   "Now," said the solicitor, "you say this and you say that.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.420]   And if he says that to you, you reply in this way."
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.020]   That's the business of the advocate.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.620]   He puts words into the man's mouth, tells him what to say.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.700]   Now that's exactly what the Spirit does with us.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.100]   He formulates petitions for us.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.100]   We don't know.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.100]   He does.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.100]   He instructs us.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.100]   He helps us.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.100]   He guides us.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:53.060]   Now, you see, the parallel, there are two kinds of advocacy which we benefit from as
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.960]   Christian people.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.460]   We know that the Lord Jesus Christ is our advocate with the Father.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.340]   He is there in person pleading for us.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.340]   We are not doing it.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.400]   He's doing it for us.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.180]   But this advocacy of the Spirit is in us.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.900]   He doesn't do it instead of us, but he tells us what to say.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.180]   Both are advocates, but it's a different style.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.140]   Again, the parallel is quite perfect, you see.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.940]   This solicitor that I'm talking about, he does two things.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.600]   He not only tells us what to say, he can also address the court himself.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.820]   When he's addressing the court, that's the picture of our Lord advocate for us with the
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.820]   Father.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.260]   But the other one is what the solicitor tells us in his office.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.780]   When he's preparing the case, telling us what to say, putting words into our mouth, and
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.820]   not doing the speaking himself at that point.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.580]   Now, the Spirit acts in this second manner.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.620]   The ideas, therefore, the thoughts, and the suggestions, and the petitions, come from
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.540]   the Spirit.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.940]   It is he who knows what is best for us in this condition.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.940]   We don't.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.740]   We don't know what to pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit does.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.100]   Now this is something, surely, which is very wonderful.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.580]   There's a mystery about it all, but this is a part of Christian experience.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:18.140]   When we are in this position, we find ourselves groaning, sighing.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.140]   What is it?
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.820]   Well, it is that the Spirit has been working in us in this way as an advocate.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.260]   Now let me give you a parallel again to explain it.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:34.500]   I take you back once more to Philippians 2, 12, and 13.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:43.180]   Work out your own salvation in fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.860]   will and to do.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.800]   That's it.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.220]   We do it, you see, we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.100]   Yes, but what makes you do this thing?
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.740]   What made you desire to do what you're doing?
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.740]   What makes you do it?
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.980]   Well, it is God.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.060]   It is God through the Spirit that worketh in us.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.700]   It's exactly the same thing here.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:13.120]   We utter these groans and sighs, yes, but it is the Spirit who has worked them in us.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.460]   But even now we are not quite clear as to what we are saying.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.820]   All we know is that we are thus moved.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.580]   We are conscious of something within us, but we can't express it perfectly.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:31.500]   It's the Spirit who has produced this feeling, and he has done it by working in us these
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:40.820]   petitions that we only express because of our infirmity in our sighing and in our groaning.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.300]   Now this is a very special action of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.900]   We couldn't pray at all were it not for the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.380]   The Holy Spirit is always working in us, always.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.660]   And all we do is the result, of course, of the operation of the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.400]   But what the Apostle is dealing with here is something very special.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.180]   This is no longer the ordinary, regular, general work of the Spirit.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.140]   It is this special work of his that he does when we are in this position.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.300]   Like the man in the illustration, which is in this word "intercession," the Spirit
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.620]   comes along as it were and sees us in difficulty and says, "This is what you must say."
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:26.500]   And we attempt to say that, and it produces nothing but a sigh or a groan.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:33.180]   So that this is a distinct and a special and a separate work which the Spirit does within
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.180]   us.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.660]   There is a sense, therefore, in which we must say that it is the Spirit himself who makes
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.660]   the intercession.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.220]   There'd be nothing said at all.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.340]   There wouldn't be even a groan or a sigh if the Spirit didn't come along and take
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:52.380]   us up this burden of ours and help us and act as our advocate and give us these petitions.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.260]   It is the Spirit himself, ultimately, who is making the intercession.
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:04.880]   But because it is done through us, it is with groanings which are wordless and which are,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   in that sense, speechless.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:12.220]   Very well, then, I say that the way to understand that particular working is to go back once
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.820]   more to this difference between verses 15 and 16.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.260]   Our Spirit in 15, the Holy Spirit himself in 16.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.020]   Ordinary prayer, yes, our Spirit.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:29.340]   We can formulate the words, we speak to God, we make our requests known unto him.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.860]   That's all the result of the work of the Spirit.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.580]   But here, this is this very special type of prayer.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.460]   When we don't know what to pray for, the what, we're in trouble, the Spirit comes
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:46.020]   along and he puts these petitions within us and they come out in these groanings which
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.060]   we can't put into words out of our hearts and out of our spirits.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.060]   Very well.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.340]   Now then, we are moving along.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.820]   I trust you are following in the argument.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:00.180]   We are still under this heading, how the Spirit exactly helps us.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:06.740]   And he helps us in that way by making intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:11.980]   So I come to my fourth point which is this one.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.780]   Is there any value in these groanings?
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.020]   You say you're just groaning, you're just sighing.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.700]   Is there any value in them?
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.820]   Oh, there is tremendous value in these, says the apostle.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.220]   And this is where the glory of the doctrine comes out.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.180]   Well, what is the value of these groanings?
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.860]   Well, he says the first answer is this, that God hears them.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.540]   He that searcheth the hearts.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.260]   Why do you think he describes God like that at this point?
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.100]   Why doesn't he say the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.020]   be uttered and God knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.100]   for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.100]   He doesn't say that.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.540]   He says, he that searcheth the hearts.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.540]   Why does he put it like that?
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:10.540]   Well, in order to bring out this glorious bit of comfort and of consolation.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.380]   God is the only one who can search our hearts.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.660]   There's a proverb which tells us that the heart knoweth its own bitterness.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.740]   Nobody else knows it.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.140]   We can't really read one another's hearts, can we?
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.820]   There are things inside our hearts that nobody else knows.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.540]   But God knows all about our hearts.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.380]   The Scriptures teach us that constantly.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.740]   God knoweth your hearts.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:42.260]   All things are naked and open unto the eye of him with whom we have to do.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.420]   The heart, says Jeremiah in chapter 17, is desperately wicked and deceitful.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.420]   Who can know it?
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:51.100]   I, the Lord, try the hearts.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.060]   That's the answer.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.020]   He does because he's God.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:03.300]   He knows all that goes on in our hearts, in the deepest recesses of our beings.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:09.100]   There are ideas there, there are wishes, there are aspirations, there are groanings, there
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.140]   are sighs.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.740]   The world knows nothing about them.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.260]   Perhaps nobody else will know anything about them.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.860]   God does.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.500]   Because he's God, he knows everything.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.880]   God alone can do this.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.780]   And he does do that.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.940]   So you see, words are not always necessary.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.500]   When you're dealing with God, you can do without words.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   Because God knows our hearts.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.700]   We are in such trouble we can't find words.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.540]   We can't express this.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.060]   It's a wordless groaning.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.100]   But God, he knows.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.380]   He knows exactly what's happening.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:46.540]   Though we haven't uttered any words, God knows exactly what's happening in your heart.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.540]   He knows all about our feelings.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.620]   He knows all about our desires.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.340]   He knows everything about our hopes.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.060]   I know of nothing which is a greater comfort and consolation than this.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:06.340]   There is no faintest whisper in the heart of men but that God can hear it.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:12.740]   If I may venture to give you such an illustration, God's receiving set is such that the faintest
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.140]   flicker, he hears it.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.700]   There is a sigh there which you're not even aware of yourself.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.580]   He's heard it.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.860]   There is nothing which he doesn't hear, nothing too faint for him.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.740]   Let me quote you some of the words we've just been singing.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:35.900]   To him commend thy cause, his ear attends the softest prayer.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   That's because he's the one who can search the heart.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:46.140]   He doesn't depend upon sounds, upon words formulated, a movement in the heart registered.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.980]   He hears it.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.740]   His ear attends the softest prayer.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.380]   Oh, listen to it again.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:58.060]   Listen to Ter Stegen, that wonderful saint who lived in the low country, what is now
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.340]   called Holland, translated by John Wesley.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.260]   God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.700]   God shall lift up thy head.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.700]   He hears thy sighs.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.440]   This seems a wonderful commentary on our text this evening.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   Listen to him again.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:19.480]   Oh, seest our weakness, Lord, our hearts are known to thee.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.880]   That's my only comfort, he says.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.360]   That's my only consolation.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.040]   I can't express it.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.960]   Our hearts are known to thee.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   Oh, lift them up, the sinking head, confirm the feeble knee.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   That's it.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.280]   It's a wonderful expression of the real meaning of these words that we're looking at together.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   Now then, there's the first thing.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.320]   God hears these groanings.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.280]   He hears every one of them, even the ones we're not aware of ourselves.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   But he not only hears them, he understands them.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.440]   How difficult it is to interpret a groan or a sigh.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.140]   You hear a person groaning.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.720]   Is it because he's in terrible trouble?
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:09.560]   Or is it because he's had some profound experience?
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   And he's just saying in that odd way, "Marvelous.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.860]   Hear me."
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   But what is it?
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.220]   You can't tell, can you?
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.320]   Is it wonder, amazement, misunderstanding?
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   You don't know.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.000]   Very difficult to interpret.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.200]   God can interpret our sighs and our groans.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   He understandeth them.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   How do you know?
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   "And he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit."
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.920]   It's the Spirit who's done it, and he knows the mind of the Spirit.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.200]   Now what does this word "mind" mean?
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.000]   Well we should be in no trouble about that.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.600]   We've met it many times already.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.960]   We've had it in the fifth verse of this chapter.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.760]   "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh."
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:59.280]   It means thought, it means ideas, it means interests, all of which lead to a course of
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.040]   action and a way of living.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.520]   That is the meaning of the word "mind" here.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:10.160]   There's a very good illustration of its meaning in Philippians 3.19, where the apostle is
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.080]   warning those Philippians against certain false believers and false teachers, "for
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.440]   God is their belly," he says, "who mind earthly things."
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.720]   Those are the things they're always thinking about.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.840]   They mind earthly things.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.560]   Those are the things that are on their minds.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.200]   Those are their expressions.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.120]   That's the realm in which they live.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.560]   Well now, he uses the same word "mind."
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.320]   "He knoweth, he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit."
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.920]   He knows what the Spirit's thinking about.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.680]   He knows what the Spirit said to you.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.240]   He knows the meaning of what the Spirit has put into your heart as a petition, though
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.880]   you don't understand and can't express it.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   God knows.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.800]   He understands the way the Spirit's mind works and the thoughts that the Spirit has
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.920]   put into you.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.480]   God knows all about them.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:07.760]   God knows the meaning behind the groans which leads to them, the meaning that leads to them.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.320]   God not only understands, he approves of the ideas.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   He welcomes them.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.280]   He likes them.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.960]   We don't understand them, but God does.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.200]   Is there any greater comfort than this?
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.440]   When you're in this condition of perplexity and you can't find words, you but groan and
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.720]   sigh and the devil says, "What's the value of that, man?
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   You don't know what you're saying.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.520]   You're not putting in a petition to God.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.000]   Answer him the next time he tells you that."
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.140]   Say, "God understands groans.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.920]   God knows the meaning of sighs.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.280]   The Spirit has put these into me.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.480]   I don't quite know, but God knows.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   That's what matters.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   He understands.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.840]   He knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit."
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.160]   But we can go even further than that.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   Still more wonderful.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.280]   "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he, the
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:01.720]   Spirit, maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   What does that mean?
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.320]   Well, it doesn't mean this, that the petitions that he gives us are petitions with which
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   God agrees.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   It includes that.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.400]   But the apostle wouldn't trouble to say that.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   That's obvious.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.240]   The Spirit being the third person in the blessed Holy Trinity, anything that he does is obviously
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   going to be in agreement with the mind of the Father.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.240]   No, no.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.520]   He's saying something much more striking, something much more wonderful for us.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520]   It's this.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.960]   "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he, the
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:38.760]   Spirit, maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.000]   In other words, the Spirit is doing this to you.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.880]   The Spirit comes alongside of us and takes up this burden and begins to act as our advocate
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   within us.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   Why?
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.240]   Well, because it's God who sent him to do it.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.120]   He's doing this according to the will of God.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.760]   It is a part of God's plan.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.680]   This is a part of God's plan for saving his people.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   The whole of salvation is God's plan.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.640]   This is a part of God's plan.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.440]   It's a part of our sanctification.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.160]   It's a part of God's way of keeping us going while we're in this evil world, this veil
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.160]   of tears.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.960]   Here are we not knowing what he sends the Spirit.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   It's God who sent the Spirit always, and the Spirit is doing this work as a part of God's
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.360]   plan for us.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.480]   He's doing it according to the will of God.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:35.440]   Now then, this you see is of some great importance to us.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:43.280]   All the work of the Spirit is a part of God's plan for us, and this in particular is a part
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.640]   of God's plan and purpose for us as his children.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.800]   He allows us to be tried.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.040]   He allows things to go against us, and here we are perplexed because of our infirmity.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.640]   All right, he sends the Spirit.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:01.480]   It is he who has sent him, and what the Spirit does is just to carry out the will of God
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:06.160]   with regard to his poor children as they're passing through this evil world.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.080]   They're not yet fully saved.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.160]   We are saved by hope.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   We haven't got it all yet.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.560]   We've merely had the first fruits, the four tests.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.280]   Some people think they've got it all.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.360]   Poor, benighted, ignorant people.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.360]   No, no.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.320]   We that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:27.080]   We will receive the first fruits, groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.160]   In that condition, he sends the Spirit to do this special work for us.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.000]   Now then, let me give you the parallel to prove it again.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.600]   Go back once more to Philippians 2, 13.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:45.240]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:51.760]   both the will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.320]   That doesn't mean that he causes us to will and to do what is his good pleasure.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:03.040]   No, it is his good pleasure that we do will and do these things.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.200]   It is a part of God's good pleasure that his people should will certain things and do certain
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.400]   things.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.960]   That we should work out our salvation in this way.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:19.040]   It is God that worketh in us both the will and to do of his own good pleasure.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.760]   There's no other reason for it at all.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.000]   It is God's good pleasure that this should happen to us.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.020]   And it is happening to us very well.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.340]   This brings me, you see, to the climax of the argument.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:37.680]   It is God who sends the Spirit to us to do this within us and produce these groanings
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.000]   which God interprets and understands.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.420]   Yes, but notice we are told that he only does this in the saints because he maketh intercession
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.220]   for the saints.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.240]   I'm going to deal with this at greater length, I hope, next week.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.840]   I simply want to complete my argument tonight.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.420]   He doesn't do it for everybody.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.580]   He doesn't do it for a man who's not a Christian.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.700]   He doesn't do it for the unbeliever.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:09.020]   He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.280]   It is God, you see, who determines who are the saints.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.880]   That's God's good pleasure.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.160]   That's the will of God.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.960]   So he only sends his Spirit to the saints, to the believers, to those who are his sons.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.340]   He only does this in those who are believers.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.900]   Very well, the final bit of argument is this.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:37.360]   If therefore you find yourself giving vent to these groanings which you can't express,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   what does it mean?
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:44.560]   Well, it is proof positive that you are a saint, which means that it is proof positive
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.120]   that you are a son of God, that you are a child of God, that you are a joint heir with
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.000]   Christ.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.040]   Nobody else sighs in this way.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.560]   Nobody else knows anything about this groaning.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:01.600]   It is the Spirit who produces the groanings in us, and he only produces them in the saints,
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.400]   in those who are the children of God.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   Therefore, if you are giving vent to these groanings and sighings, you are a saint, you
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:14.640]   are a child of God, and you've got absolute proof once more of your final complete salvation.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.760]   Don't you see what a wonderful argument it is?
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.800]   You see, you started off like this.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   You were in perplexity.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   You didn't know what to pray for as you ought.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.240]   And then you found yourself groaning and sighing, and the devil said, "That's it.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.680]   You've got nothing to do with God at all.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   You're not a Christian.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   You've never been one.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   You don't know where you are.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.680]   You're utterly muddled."
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   And no child of God would be like that.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.440]   God would never allow his children to be like that.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.320]   Now, then, the next time the devil comes to you like that in that condition, work the
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.600]   argument right round on him.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.800]   Say, "Look here, you're making the grand mistake of your life.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.000]   My groanings are the finest proof I've got up to date of the fact that I'm a child of
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   God."
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.040]   It's only children of God who do groan like this.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   The Spirit only does this work in the children of God.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:07.880]   So far from being depressed and discouraged by your groanings, your wordless groanings
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.360]   in this condition, lift up your head.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.320]   It's an absolute proof again that you're a child of God.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:22.080]   The Spirit is doing in you this work that he only does in the saints.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   So what appears at first sight to be so discouraging and depressing ends off because of this will
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:37.200]   of God in our perfection as we pass through this world in becoming one of the strongest
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:44.320]   arguments and proofs we can ever know of the fact of our true relationship to God.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:50.600]   The unbeliever, the non-Christian, the man of the world has never known such groanings.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.080]   He never will until he becomes a child of God.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.680]   Then he'll begin to know them, but not until then.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.080]   Well, isn't it a wonderful argument?
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:06.480]   Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.980]   But the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:19.520]   And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, for he maketh intercession
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.400]   for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.920]   What a glorious salvation!
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.040]   Rejoice in it.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:38.720]   Out of your depression and misery, rise up and praise God for your groanings and sighs.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:45.440]   As you remember that every one of them is known to God, every one of them.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.400]   And he has sent his Spirit into you to lead you along this way in order that eventually
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:59.920]   you might be perfect and spotless, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, glorified
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.440]   in his glorious presence.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   Let us pray.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:11.320]   O Lord, our God, we lift up our hearts to thee in humble praise and thanksgiving for
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.760]   so great and so glorious a salvation.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:19.360]   We thank thee in particular tonight for this particular aspect of it.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:25.900]   O God, we are filled with amazement as we realize something new and fresh concerning
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.280]   thy will with respect to us.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:35.200]   Lord, we know that it is our sanctification that is thy will, that thy will is our final
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.240]   glorification, and that nothing shall prevent it nor stop it.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:45.760]   We thank thee therefore for every experience, for every turn in the way, for the things
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.280]   that at first we cannot understand and that tend to depress us.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.800]   Lord, forgive us that we ever allow that to happen, but we thank thee that thou dost ever
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   thus enable us to turn the defeats into glorious victories, and we go on as more than conquerors.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.160]   O God, receive our praise.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:14.400]   And now, unto him that is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:22.160]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Savior, the glory
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:29.160]   of majesty, dominion, and power, both now and ever.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.160]   Amen.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:37.920]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
