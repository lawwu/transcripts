[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Who is first in our docket here?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   First question is from Eli and the question states this,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   "I finally purchased a treadmill that goes under my standing desk so I can avoid sitting all day and get more steps in.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I'm wondering your thoughts on the effects of walking while working. Does it create the same issues as contact switching?"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Well, okay, so Eli is one of these people who does the exercise equipment at their desk with their computer.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   If you listen to this show instead of watching it on our YouTube channel, you might not know, like our YouTube watchers know,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   that when Jesse and I are recording this show, we're doing so on NordicTrack machines. Am I right, Jesse?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And sometimes you're on a rower.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Sometimes I'm on a rower and Jesse holds a microphone on a boom and just moves it back and forth with me while I row
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   because I'm not going to give up opportunities to stay in shape.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Eli, I'm a big walking fan, longtime listener to the show, know this.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I think walking is particularly good for creative insight.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So I need a solution to a problem. I need a new business strategy.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I need a way to open this article. How am I going to open this article?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I'm working on a proof and I don't even know where to get into it.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Something about the motion helps. I've heard a lot of explanations.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I don't know if this one is true, but it's the one I often think sounds right,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   which is the circuits involved in motion are prescribed.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And somehow when those circuits are fired up, it suppresses other parts of your brain
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and makes it easier somehow to focus on whatever you're trying to focus on
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   because there's a lot of sort of distractions or other things pulling at your attention.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   They're somehow being suppressed. I don't know if that's true. We'd have to ask Andrew Huberman.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We should just have a hotline, Jesse. Ask Andrew Huberman whenever we have a brain issue that comes up.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And basically every time I would say something about how the brain operates,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   you would then call, press that button and Andrew would conference in and explain how everything I said was just wrong.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That's a great idea. That'd be great. Yeah, I'm sure he would be game.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Yeah. What else does he have to do? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   All right. So I'm a big fan of walking. I'm not a big fan of walking desks or even to be honest, standing desk.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Because to me, it feels like you're capitulating.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Work means I need to be here in front of this glowing rectangle all day.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So how can I compensate? I think you should be walking a lot during the workday outside.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You need the novel stimuli, the weather. It's cold today. It's hot today.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm seeing different things. I'm hearing the birds.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's good for your soul as a human and you're going to get more insight out of that other type of work that is not creative inside work.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I think actually could be harder while you're, let's say, on a treadmill.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So if you're trying to answer an email, that's very different.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Now, here you're trying to do very precise English composition.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   OK, how do I how do I precisely say this thing?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I want to say in a way that has to write inflection and conveys the nuance of what I mean.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That's actually something I think is harder to do while you're in motion.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So the idea that you want to be in motion for all types of your work, I don't think I agree with.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So I think walking is good for some work, bad for others.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And the right way to take advantage of that is make walking be something you do outside.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And make other computer screen work be stuff you do at your computer screen.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Keep in mind, there's a lot of things you think you need your computer for that you can actually work out on notebooks and then come back and enter into your computer.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So, yes, your business strategy or the article you're writing eventually does have to be typed, but you can bring a notebook with you, walk, figure that out on foot and then come back and type it in.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So that's the way that's where I fall on walking.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I would also say if you work from home right now, it's like maybe due to the pandemic, your company has a more permanent remote work setup.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Take advantage of it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   10 to 15000 steps a day throughout the day.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Not a mega hike at 5 a.m.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Walk first thing in the morning, walk at the end of the day, shut it down, walk at lunch and have a couple of short walks in between.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Put it on your calendar. Keep walking.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's one of the great advantages you have with working from home.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So don't lose don't lose that possibility.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   [MUSIC]
