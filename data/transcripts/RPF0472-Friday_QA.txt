[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:52.960]   It's Friday, that means it's time for live Q&A.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.960]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.720]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.000]   On Fridays we do Q&A so hopefully you get a little bit of that in-call encouragement
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and insight.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.480]   You call up and ask questions and I do my best to come up with answers.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.800]   Here we go.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.720]   Friday Q&A shows are open to patrons of the show.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.680]   If you'd like to become a supporting patron of the show, you can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.640]   Basically, the way it works is I do my best to seek to keep you, the listener, as my fundamental
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640]   customer in the business.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.400]   One of the ways that I have worked out to be able to do that has been to build and focus
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.320]   on the Patreon program.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.880]   Probably the best reward that I've come up with for those of you who sign up to support
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.000]   the show each and every month financially has been access to these live Q&A calls.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It works.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's a win for you and a win for me.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.480]   It's a win for me because it keeps the number of callers down to three, four, five, six,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.920]   seven calls which I can handle in an hour.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.280]   It's a win for you because you get pretty much guaranteed access.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.000]   Every single caller who called in today is able to get online.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.160]   That can sometimes be good and sometimes can be bad, but let's get right to it.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.680]   To start with, Heather from Tennessee, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.360]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.000]   Both my husband and I are self-employed and we have traditional IRA that we have already
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.320]   maxed out for this year.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.880]   We are considering opening a simple 401(k) and was just wondering if the IRA contributions
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.800]   we've already made count toward the amount we can place in that simple 401(k).
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   No.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.960]   They don't.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.800]   Traditional IRAs and any kind of employer-sponsored plan function on two different measurement
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120]   scales and they are unrelated measurement scales.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.880]   Literally anybody who has any kind of plan, who makes any kind of money, anybody can contribute
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.520]   to a traditional IRA.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.400]   The difference comes down to the deductibility of those contributions.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.200]   So no matter your income, no matter whether you have 401(k)s, a simple 401(k) in your
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   business or any of those things, it comes down to – it's a totally different scale.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.000]   Anybody can contribute to an IRA.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   If your income is over a certain amount, then you may not be able to actually deduct your
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.040]   IRA contributions.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.960]   And that income amount goes based upon essentially a chart that says first and foremost, are
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.680]   you covered by an employer plan?
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   So if you are not covered by an employer plan, there's no income limit on the ability to
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.520]   deduct an IRA contribution.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.600]   So in this context, both you and your husband are able to contribute to a traditional IRA
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.960]   up to the maximum and you are allowed to deduct that on your taxes, no matter what, no matter
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.520]   how much income is covered.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.880]   So if you are not covered by a retirement plan at work, then – and as long as neither
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.600]   of you, since both of you work in the same business, then neither of you are covered
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.260]   by a retirement plan at work.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.360]   You can make a full contribution and you're entitled to take a full deduction.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.960]   However, if one of you or both of you is covered by a retirement plan at work, then your ability
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.640]   to deduct your IRA contributions will be based upon your income.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.000]   So in this context, if both of you are covered by a retirement plan at work and you're filing
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.180]   your taxes as married filing jointly, if your modified adjusted gross income is more than
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:07.000]   in 2017, about $100,000, I think it's $99,000, then you will not be able to deduct your contributions
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.600]   to the IRA.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.620]   So basically, there are two different scales.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.800]   You can participate in both, but depending on your actual income, you may or may not
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.560]   be able to deduct your IRA contributions.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.640]   Are both of you – if you were to set up a retirement plan at work, are you in danger
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.480]   of losing your deductions because you are earning more than $99,000, Heather?
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   Yes.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   Okay.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.960]   So in that context, you need to sit down and calculate what the benefits are, what the
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   costs are.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.560]   Is it worth it to you to be able to get more money in?
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.480]   Do you want to deal with the hassle of it?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.840]   Describe to me a little bit about the nature of your business, please.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.560]   Well, I have a business where I refurbish jewelry and sell it.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.920]   And my husband is a realtor and an auctioneer.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.360]   Do either of you have employees?
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.920]   No.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.720]   We have contract – temporary day laborers.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   Great.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   So that makes it really simple.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.800]   If you don't have any employees and you're simply hiring a little bit of contract labor
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.520]   here and there, then you don't have to go through the hassle and the expense of setting
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.800]   up a plan that covers all of your employees.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.120]   The major cost to you as an employer for setting up a group plan is going to be that you have
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.320]   to cover all of your employees.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.400]   And so as an employer, this can be very, very expensive to do.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.920]   It may be worth it to do but that worth always depends – usually depends on number one,
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.320]   if you can afford it.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.240]   Do you have enough income to cover it?
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   Number two, if your employees will actually value it and participate.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.880]   So in white-collar professions, most – I believe most is an accurate word.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   Many if not most employees will value their ability to participate in the company's
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.720]   401(k) plan.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.000]   So it's pretty standard that if you're going to work in a white-collar corporate
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.800]   entity that you're going to participate in – that you need to have one set up to
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.360]   be able to attract to you quality employees.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.280]   If your employees are earning 60, 80, 100, $150,000 a year, they're going to value
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.840]   the ability to defer some of that income into a 401(k).
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.120]   Where you get into challenges would be businesses like your husband's.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.000]   If he had employees or if he were running a construction company or a small business
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.800]   of some kind and he had a few staff members who were earning 25, 30, $40,000 per year,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   often that type of employee doesn't value their ability to participate in a 401(k) very
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   much.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.400]   So they find it very difficult to get enough enrollment so that everybody can participate.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.880]   The business owner is often in great danger.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.360]   If they can't get enough enrollment by the people, then the business owner themself is
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:00.760]   not able to participate in that 401(k) plan because it will be considered to be a plan
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   that's too heavily skewed towards the interest of the business owner and not appropriately
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   oriented towards the employees.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.920]   So all that to say that because you and your husband don't have employees, that's great.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.080]   Now you're in a situation where you just can look and say, "What's going to be
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.280]   the best for us?"
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.200]   And so a simple IRA could be simple to set up.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   A SEP IRA could also work for you or a solo 401(k) which I outlined in last week's
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.360]   Q&A for you and you can go back and listen to that for details on that.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:38.840]   But if you earn more than $99,000 and if you participate in your group plan, then you will
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.320]   not be able to take your deduction for your traditional IRA.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.080]   Remember however that that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't contribute to a Roth
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.200]   IRA.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.920]   And so the Roth IRA works on a different scale and the Roth IRA works on simply the scale
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.400]   of your income and it doesn't matter whether you are or are not covered by an employer
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   plan.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:08.560]   So the scale for a Roth IRA for a married couple filing jointly in 2017 is $186,000.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.440]   Do you think that your modified adjusted gross income would be lower than $186,000 or higher
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.480]   than that?
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.000]   It will be lower.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Okay.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.320]   So what you can do is probably the best of both worlds is establish some kind of plan
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   at work.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   A simple plan would work fine or a SEP or whatever you choose to do and then go ahead
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.240]   and just make contributions to a Roth IRA.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.320]   You won't get the upfront tax deduction but you will get the benefits of a Roth IRA and
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:40.080]   as long as your modified adjusted gross income is less than $186,000, you can make that contribution.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   Good for now.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   Any other follow-up questions?
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:49.720]   So I listened that the call last week is how we found out about the simple IRA or the simple
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.940]   401(k) excuse me.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:10:00.200]   We have a SEP set up but we've never contributed to it because our accountant says that it
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.440]   wouldn't benefit us.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.480]   So we've just never put any money in it.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:12.800]   So with the $18,000 that you can put in the 401(k) plus the other that's the formula-based,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:20.700]   does the $5,500 that I've already put into my IRA take away from that $18,000?
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.680]   The scale for your contribution to the IRA and the amounts that you're going to contribute
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.880]   to an employer plan of any kind are unrelated.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   Okay.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   They are unrelated.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   They're completely unrelated.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   Okay.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   So that does answer my question.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   Great.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880]   Awesome.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   Thank you so much for calling in.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   Thank you.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   All right.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   Next up we've got Tim in Alabama.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   We got the South.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.080]   I got Tennessee, Tennessee, Alabama and one caller from Iowa.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.000]   Tim in Alabama, welcome to the show.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Hey Joshua.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.400]   Thanks for letting us call in.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.440]   I really appreciate your show and one of the parts I appreciate about it is hearing about
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.160]   books on different topics and it's really opened my eyes to books on financial planning,
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   investing and personal finance.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.800]   I was wondering if you had a list of the top books that you recommend in these subjects
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   or where you would start, that kind of thing.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.160]   I get asked this question.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.440]   I've had so many people say, "Joshua, can you recommend a reading list?"
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.360]   And I'll tell you why I struggle with it and then I will try to give you a couple of answers.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.720]   And I'll tell you a little bit about my story and why I struggle with it.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   When I grew up, I didn't have anybody that came alongside to try to teach me about money.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   I really didn't.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:43.280]   I didn't have – my parents were – did a great job and were excellent parents.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.680]   But they weren't particularly all that interested in business.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.680]   My dad is an engineer.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.200]   He's not a businessman.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.880]   He doesn't particularly care that much about money in the context of being rich was never
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.000]   one of his goals.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.360]   And similarly with my mom.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.520]   So neither of them was a big influence for me like some parents are to talk about here
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.600]   is everything you need to know about money.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:13.200]   I really didn't have any experience in – with people in my life that would come and do that.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.880]   So most of my exposure to finance just simply came because I was always interested in the
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.040]   subject and I'd go down to the bookstore and my favorite sections seemed to be the
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.000]   business section and the personal finance section.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.640]   And so I started my path in with personal finance.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.560]   For example, I can remember reading a book like David Bach, well-known author of the
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   – I'm blanking on his series.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.280]   Yes, automatic – thank you.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.040]   I remember reading The Automatic Millionaire and it just blew my mind and I was exposed
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.520]   to the simple concept that if you just don't buy a latte a day and you just save the money
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.000]   and put it into a mutual fund, then wow, I can be rich and it can happen automatically
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.440]   and this is so great.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.360]   And it's just a simple personal finance book but it opened my eyes and it kind of
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   blew my mind.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   It's like, wow, this can be – this is fantastic.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.600]   I remember the first book I ever read on index investing.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.640]   I think it was called The Lazy Man's Guide to Investing, something like that.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   It was talking about the portfolio of buy a stock index fund and a bond index fund and
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.040]   boom, you're done and you get great results and I just thought, wow, how cool is that?
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.680]   And I basically kind of read my way through what I consider to be the standard bibliography
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.920]   for mainstream personal finance.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.360]   Rich dad, poor dad, check.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   That was the book that all of my friends were reading and Millionaire Next Door, check,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.800]   and Dave Ramsey, check.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.440]   These books were all very influential on me and they had a big impact on my life.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.560]   And so I would encourage others to read them and I would share them with other people,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.560]   et cetera.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.960]   But then I moved and over time – and of course there were others that were more technical
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.240]   that are not bestsellers.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.120]   To create a bestselling book that everyone is going to know, it's got to be light.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.800]   It's got to be a narrative basically and it's got to be non-boring.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.000]   So some of the more technical – technically valuable ones with comprehensive discussions
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.160]   are generally don't get nearly the airtime that a simple book does.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.400]   But then I moved into the world of professional finance and in professional finance, I thought
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.840]   that I had all of the – I thought I had figured everything out.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.640]   All I got to do is just get other people to do the automatic millionaire approach or to
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.960]   get out of debt a la Dave Ramsey, et cetera.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.080]   I grew to learn that there was kind of a little bit more to it.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:40.920]   I looked around and basically the most challenging thing for me was noticing that nobody – that
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.880]   my clients didn't necessarily look like the people that I thought they would look
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.280]   like because they were – they had followed the automatic millionaire plan.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.200]   I realized that it wasn't that it didn't work.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.560]   Of course, most of us have – most of us who were professional financial advisors,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.120]   we'd have some clients that worked a job and saved money in their 401(k), et cetera.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.300]   But I just looked around and realized that often there were other paths.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.520]   There was a high percentage of entrepreneurs.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:15.640]   There was a high percentage of very high-paid, highly paid people, highly paid professionals.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.040]   Many people had unique investment ideas.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.720]   I remember how strange it was when I was sitting and be sitting in front of someone who was
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.920]   super rich and they would say, "I don't invest in stocks.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.720]   I don't trust the stock market."
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:34.060]   Here I was completely convinced of the stability of stocks because that was what every one
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:40.040]   of these books said and it was religious heresy to say, "I don't trust the stock market."
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.000]   I was trained to undo that.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.400]   I was trained to overcome those objections and with good backing to some degree.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.200]   But over time, I just grew to look at things a little bit differently.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   I started to look and then I started to understand how in essence most of the people – I started
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.040]   to look at how people got rich, not how they said to get rich.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.320]   Then I looked at David Bach and I studied his history a little bit and I understood
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.520]   that, wait a second, it's a valuable story to tell about him being a Merrill Lynch financial
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.920]   advisor and sitting there and talking about how you can become an automatic millionaire
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.120]   over time.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:26.760]   But in reality, he built this mega huge powerful information publishing business and that was
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.320]   how he got rich.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.880]   Then I would sit and I looked at Dave Ramsey's business and I thought to myself and I kind
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.080]   of analyzed it and I said, "Wait a second.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.480]   There's a difference here between the advice that he gives to a listener who's earning
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.280]   a little bit of money and saving money versus the type of business that he chose and the
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.640]   type of business he was able to do."
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.920]   I went in my local area and I talked to some of my rich clients and rich friends and people
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.400]   and I all of a sudden realized that even me as a financial advisor, I was working to get
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:03.760]   rich not by saving 10% of my 401(k) but rather by using the power of synthetic equity, synthetic
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.120]   leverage by using other people's money for me to earn my own money off of, by using and
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.760]   taking a fee for the control of other people's money.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.960]   Then I started to realize that, well, wait a second, I could do that in just about any
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   business.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.160]   I can go and I don't necessarily need to own the real estate.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.520]   I can go and start a real estate management company and take advantage by providing a
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.720]   service, et cetera.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.280]   I started to look at the world a little different.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:35.160]   Over time, I became deeply – I guess I just became attracted to a different philosophy,
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.920]   to trying to understand things a little bit deeper.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.800]   I've never known or understood if it's necessary to go down the path that I went,
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.680]   reading the simple books, reading a powerful allegory like The Richest Man in Babylon and
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.320]   dropping all these names as just hopefully useful things to consider.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.480]   I never have figured out if it's necessary to go that way or if it's possible to come
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.240]   a different way.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.600]   I struggle to recommend books because so much of it is – I look at it and say, "Where
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.920]   is this person at this point in time?"
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.960]   I generally don't recommend Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   I don't recommend it.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.880]   But there are times in which I would recommend it.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.560]   I don't just hand out Total Money Makeover like I used to, but there are times in which
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.000]   I would recommend it.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.640]   I have struggled and struggled to come up with that reading list because I don't particularly
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.280]   see any value of somebody reading through 10 or 15 or 20 books unless they're reading
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.840]   for the meta-narrative of those books.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.960]   It's my hope that I can kind of suss out the meta-narrative, the philosophy.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.800]   Unfortunately, I found it hard to articulate it in print myself.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.920]   I've done it more here on the show, but I've taken kind of all the books and I've
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:00.880]   categorized what I've learned from them in terms of these differing approaches.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.200]   What I'm trying to figure out how I can get out and get into educational format that's
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:14.000]   accessible to people is the underlying truths that are the same no matter whose approach
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.200]   or no matter which book.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.220]   So long roundabout way of saying I struggle to answer that question unless you give me
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.680]   a specific scenario that I may be able to recommend the book.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.280]   So tell me about your situation and I'll try to make a book recommendation specific
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   to you.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.040]   I think I'm pretty similar to you.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.960]   I used to be a big Dave Ramsey fan.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.160]   I don't dislike him now, but I think I have very similar views to you and went through
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.720]   all the books that you were describing.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.560]   I guess I'm not sure if there was a particular topic I was interested in hearing your opinion
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   on just generally.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:55.560]   One thing I've gotten into recently is different equity investing strategies like index versus
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.040]   dividend value investing.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.880]   Do you have any recommendations in that arena?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.080]   I don't have anything there.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.820]   It's out of my area of interest, so I don't have anything there.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.920]   But I will give you two book recommendations that are books that I'm reading right now
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.260]   that are deeply affecting my thinking.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.640]   So literally I'm almost finished with both of these books, reading them simultaneously.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:29.120]   One is a recent book by Tyler Cohen called The Complacent Class and this is a recently
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.760]   published in the last year or so.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:41.100]   And basically it's a discussion of the changing nature of the American culture and what's
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:47.500]   happening in the US American – I don't know a better way to say it, the culture.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.060]   It's called The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:59.660]   This book is giving me really good – it's more of a book, a sociological book, not a
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.100]   finance book, but it's giving me a lot of insight into things I've kind of felt but
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.620]   didn't have any data on.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.820]   That's been really interesting.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:16.980]   And simultaneously, I'm reading it with a – reading it – reading also a book by
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.460]   an author named R.G.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:25.740]   Letourneau and it's called Mover of Men and Mountains.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.740]   Let me find it.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.740]   It's in the other room.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.740]   I can't get the title correctly.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.540]   In just a moment, I'll give you the exact title.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.980]   But this – yeah, it's called Mover of Men and Mountains and it's the biography
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.300]   – or I think – sorry, autobiography of a man named R.G.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:51.380]   Letourneau who made his – built his business in the early 1900s, came of age basically
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.620]   around the turn of the century in about 1900.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:01.700]   And he went on to become just this mega wealthy and hugely influential construction – man
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.740]   who constructed heavy equipment.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:12.860]   He single-handedly designed and developed all kinds of heavy machinery which is just
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.820]   really, really an incredible story.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:23.700]   And what has been fascinating is reading these two books simultaneously has showed me a culture
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.460]   that I have never experienced, a culture of American dynamism that has basically fallen
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:35.820]   off the scene before I arrived in the United States of America, a culture – an American
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:43.140]   culture that shifted – that is just constantly growing and kind of stretching at the seams
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.620]   and then moving on to build bigger machines and move faster and just this incredible cultural
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.340]   dynamism that today is long gone.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.400]   And what's been so fascinating is reading Tyler Cohen's book, a modern book written
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.660]   by a sociologist looking back and saying, "Hey, look.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.940]   This is all dead and gone and what's the future hold when essentially we're so comfortable
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:13.740]   and so complacent that we don't really go out and strive for anything difficult now?"
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.180]   And then I go back and read this insight, this firsthand account of just fascinating
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.580]   stories of what life was like back at the turn of the century with this man who had
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:28.620]   this just incredible business story, went broke, deep in debt, went broke, deep in debt,
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:34.760]   went broke, deep in debt, and then ultimately down the way made a massive, massive fortune.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.700]   So there are two book recommendations that are just simply current books that I have
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.100]   found fascinating and I'll be done with them probably by the end of the weekend and
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.620]   you might enjoy both of those books.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.620]   That's the best I got for you.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.620]   Great.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.620]   Thank you very much.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.620]   You're very welcome.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:55.260]   I've gotten that email from so many listeners about what book and whatnot.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.060]   So now you know why I struggle to answer it.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.020]   All right, Matthew in Tennessee, let's stay in the South.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.020]   Welcome back to the show.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.020]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.020]   Good afternoon.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:12.660]   My question right now is around your website design and I was just curious of what your
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.220]   overall experience of working with Silly Grasshopper.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.980]   Did they complete the design of your website and also do they offer any back-end support
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.140]   on like an hourly basis to customers?
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.460]   Can you kind of go over that relationship that you have and kind of your experience
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.460]   with it?
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.780]   Absolutely.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:36.220]   So Silly Grasshopper is the company name for the company that handles my website and they
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.580]   built it.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:44.540]   The owner of the company was a longtime friend of mine and so I've known him for a long time.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.900]   So my review is biased because of the personal relationship.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.220]   But in a professional capacity, Jonathan does an amazing job.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.220]   He's done a great job.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.900]   He does a very good job with design.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.140]   He's excellent.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.460]   He does a good job and I can't do more than that.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.100]   I've done some ads for him and given him various accommodations.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.860]   I have several listeners who have sought him out for his design work.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:17.500]   What I do and what he does for me is he built my site.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:26.780]   I wrote a good amount of it but he built it and he hosts it and he also does everything
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.780]   – he and his team.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.820]   It's not just him.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.860]   But he and his team do everything on the site for me.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.980]   So I actually don't – the only thing I do on the site is essentially approve comments.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.980]   That's something I do just to make sure that I get a chance to read all the comments
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.740]   that all of you listeners put on there.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.740]   But one of the most frustrating things to me about my business is having to deal with
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.620]   WordPress and having to deal with web design and all of that.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.140]   If I were going to go back and do it again, I probably would not build a WordPress site
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:03.500]   which is heresy simply because basically the majority of the internet is built on WordPress
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:09.140]   and WordPress is definitely the common language of the online world.
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.900]   But I have found just the process of learning WordPress to be so frustrating.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.120]   It's not that you can't do the basics.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.140]   It's that to do something well, it needs to be well-designed.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:26.100]   Yes, you can get – when you set up a WordPress site and I've set up a couple more on my
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   own.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.180]   But when you go and set up a WordPress site, you can set it up and there's about a bazillion
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.140]   free themes you can use and there are all kinds of great themes.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.140]   But it's not intuitive.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.140]   You got to learn the language.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.960]   I've always been frustrated by that aspect of web work.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.900]   One thing I would always seriously consider is I would seriously consider using a platform
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.220]   like Squarespace instead of WordPress.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.620]   A friend of mine who is a real techie explained it to me in this way and it made a lot of
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.460]   sense to me.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:03.900]   And so they said to me – he said in essence, Squarespace is similar to what an Apple iPhone
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:11.260]   is where Apple – one of the secrets that makes the iOS platform, the Apple iPhone platform
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:16.780]   so powerful is Apple creates both the hardware and the software.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.540]   And as such, the software is written for the hardware and it's very, very standardized
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.860]   which means it's consistently excellent.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:32.500]   It's not – doesn't have as many options as the open source Android platform but it's
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.020]   consistently excellent.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.780]   So when Android pushes out – excuse me, when Apple pushes out an update to the iPhones,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.100]   they do that regularly and there are only a certain limited number of iPhones and so
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.700]   they can keep the software patched.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:51.980]   And so because of that, iOS is inherently more secure and inherently more stable than
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.580]   the Android platform.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:28:00.380]   And so Squarespace is a platform where you go to them and you purchase their website
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.380]   services.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.900]   They set up the server for you.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.920]   They handle the hosting of your content.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.940]   They have a limited number of themes that you can choose from and then you have a limited
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.820]   number of modules that you can put on those themes.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.700]   But most people could put and get their website exactly as they need it on Squarespace.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.020]   The great thing is when Squarespace is updating the module, they're updating that module
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.180]   and they've got the hosting, they've got the themes.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.740]   Everything is done really, really well on that context.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.540]   It's not as cheap as a WordPress site can be but it's a really good value.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.380]   And so I reached out to Squarespace.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.500]   I wanted them to sponsor the show because I have this opinion of that that I just shared
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   with you.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.980]   I've never been able to set up a sponsorship with them sponsoring the show but I really
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.100]   think that that's worth your looking into.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.460]   WordPress on the other hand is definitely far more powerful and there are so many more
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.220]   powerful things that can be built on WordPress and it's really, really good.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.160]   But to get its best, you're probably going to wind up with a designer, somebody handling
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   your site.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.580]   I think that that's where Silly Grasshopper comes in.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.340]   That's where Jonathan and his team do a good job for me and it's freed me of a tremendous
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.820]   energy to be able to just not worry about it.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.100]   So I have a standing arrangement with them.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.980]   I pay them a not insignificant fee and we have a business arrangement.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.780]   I'm not sure if it's custom to me or if it's – I think he offers that to some other people
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.780]   as well.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.640]   But it handles – hosting handles a bunch of other stuff.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.860]   So I wholeheartedly endorse and recommend if you need help with WordPress or if you
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.380]   need help setting up a website and you're intimidated by doing it by yourself, sillygrasshopper.com.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.380]   I sent you.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.300]   Yeah, I definitely will.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:48.740]   I agree with what you were saying about kind of trying to take on the whole WordPress world
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:53.820]   and it's just things just – in an early stage of trying to get a business off the
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.500]   ground, it just seems like a waste of time.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.340]   So I understand exactly what you're saying.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   Thank you for that.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.340]   You're welcome.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.340]   Anything else?
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.340]   Yes.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.340]   So that's kind of a boring question.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:11.100]   Maybe something that will be a little bit more exciting for you and your audience.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:17.980]   So say that you and your family are going on a trip for a decade and during this trip
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:23.500]   you will have no access to phone or the internet.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.620]   But you also care about – and you also have a pot of money and you care very much about
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.620]   keeping up with inflation.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.900]   So I'm only going to give you the option of selecting three investments that you could
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:39.100]   put capital into but you can't control them because you're going to be gone for a decade
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.180]   and you can't really have any day-to-day reaction.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.940]   Do you have any idea of what those three investments would be and why?
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.940]   Permanent portfolio.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.260]   I mean, that's the question.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.620]   That's what Harry – what was his name?
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.660]   That's what they tried to solve with the permanent portfolio was to say that we have no idea
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:07.020]   which of these things are going to really turn out and so how can we just simply buy
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   the market.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.020]   So the basic outline of the permanent portfolio was the simplified version.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.260]   Put 25% of your money into essentially a cash fund.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.420]   Put 25% into long-term bonds.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.780]   25% into stock – broad-based stocks.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.020]   Index funds work great.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.980]   And 25% in gold.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:28.620]   And if you go through the whole theory of it, I've always just found it to be powerful.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.580]   And basically, I've never seen a good refutation of the permanent portfolio that didn't say
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.700]   it fundamentally was flawed.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.620]   But what happens is people are flawed.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:46.140]   And so what's frustrating about the permanent portfolio in my observation is that usually
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.780]   the returns will lag almost constantly.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.280]   And so you always feel like I'm behind everybody else.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.820]   And so because of that, very – many people have a hard time sticking with the permanent
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.820]   portfolio.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.060]   But I think I would basically do that.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.200]   I would – and the constraints that you've given me, the best answer is find a steward
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:11.080]   of the money and find somebody who can – who you trust and who is trustworthy.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.720]   But absent that, I would buy – put a third of the money in gold.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.280]   I put a third of the money into stocks.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.040]   I just buy a broad-based index fund and I put a third of the money in bonds and I'd
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.560]   come back in a decade and probably be far richer than I am today.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.920]   Got it.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.920]   That makes sense.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:34.160]   I didn't know if you were going to go toward the route of just buying three homes or maybe
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.320]   trying to pick three companies that you know would be bigger in a decade no matter what
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   they kind of do.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   But I completely understand that.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:48.240]   No, basically – no, basically what's funny about this question over the years, I've
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:55.160]   become so cavalier about what's a good investment because at its core, investment is not – good
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:02.080]   investing is more about a process of investing than it is about a specific investment.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.680]   The other thing that I've seen is that you can find thousands of strategies that are
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.080]   powerful and will work really well if the investor will stay with the actual strategy.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.440]   I've read books over the years on talking about a portfolio of a few stocks that you
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.040]   could put together that's just a great portfolio.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.180]   I break it down to one, even if you just pick one company.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:35.600]   My wife was given years ago by her grandparents I think one share of Coca-Cola as a birthday
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   present one year.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.440]   It was the most annoying thing where you get this 27-cent dividend check that comes in.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.320]   But I've always thought of that as kind of – as an analogy.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:57.500]   You can beat up a company like Coca-Cola from an investment perspective if you want to make
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.960]   your portfolio shine.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.440]   You can talk about, well, it's a single stock.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.040]   It's far too risky.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.140]   It's going to be volatile and it's going to be all over the place.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:12.400]   But if you gave me the option, if you said, "Joshua, you can buy – I'm going to put
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:20.280]   $100,000 if I would be happy to buy $33,000 of Coca-Cola stock, $33,000 of Walmart stock
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.120]   and $33,000 of insert whatever well-known company you want here, GE or it doesn't
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.120]   even matter, Apple.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.120]   I don't care."
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:35.480]   The reality is these companies, a large company like Coca-Cola is constantly changing and
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   adapting.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   Hold on one second.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.000]   My coworkers are wanting to have their voices heard.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.640]   A company like a Coca-Cola is constantly adapting to the marketplace.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   So when fizzy soft drinks fall out of favor because people don't want to drink that much
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:58.120]   sugar, Coca-Cola just goes out and buys a fruit beverage company or water companies,
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   et cetera.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:05.440]   If you actually look at the asset base of a giant company like Coca-Cola, they have
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:17.080]   such stability in their business and any company that's – any publicly traded company that's
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.240]   like that is so stable that I would be perfectly happy just to own three stocks.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.860]   You always run a risk that any one company could go bankrupt.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.360]   That is always the risk of company.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.000]   You may have picked GM because GM was the number one greatest company ever.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.360]   But if you go and read – who was it?
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.400]   Joshua Kennan did a bunch of great case studies.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   Kennan is K-E-N-N-O-N.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.860]   He's a value investor, excellent writer.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:54.860]   He recently started a hedge fund or mutual fund and so he delisted about a thousand articles
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.860]   from his website.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.400]   So I don't know what's there these days.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.640]   But Joshua Kennan did a bunch of case studies of individual companies and he wrote through
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.760]   some case studies of even a couple of companies that had gone bankrupt.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.040]   If you had invested $10,000 with this company and then just simply held it over the course
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.760]   of years and decades, how much money would you have?
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.480]   I forget the company that he used as his example of a company that went totally bankrupt.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   I think it was Kodak.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.320]   Actually, that's what – it was Eastman Kodak.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.060]   If you had invested in Kodak, you would have been so wealthy even though the company ended
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.440]   in bankruptcy just by owning it and staying put.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:37.640]   So in reality, almost any investment plan is fine as long as you just simply own it
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.840]   and stay put.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.140]   If you could – you could buy three houses.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.940]   You need someone to take care of them.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.720]   But if you – as part of my deal, you say you can have someone take care of them, that's
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.720]   fine.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:53.360]   You just wisely choose three houses in a kind of a town that's on the growth, on the increase
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.480]   and neighborhoods that are on the increase and you leave them alone for ten years, come
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   back.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.160]   You're probably going to be richer than you are today.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.440]   Buy three companies.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.080]   Buy three asset classes.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:09.600]   The key in almost every single investment success is that the investor sticks with their
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.800]   strategy.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.880]   The key in almost every single failure is that the investor bails due to fear or due
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.360]   to greed.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.840]   If you can control for fear and greed, which is how you controlled it by walking out for
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:31.680]   ten years, then you can almost assuredly account for success.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.400]   All right.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.560]   Last, Ms. Lori in Iowa.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   Welcome to the show.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.680]   Lori Cudone, CFO Alphabet and Google
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.000]   I listened to your podcast since you started and I have kind of been a way late for lately.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.640]   But not too long ago, I took a note when you were talking about a charitable remainder
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.480]   trust and the note I wrote myself was, "Can I buy a house with one of these?"
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:03.040]   And I don't remember exactly a lot about the podcast and this discussion at the time,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.600]   but I've always had a belief that the upper class in the US use trust to their advantage
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:15.400]   and is something like that a way to shelter a pool of money from taxes and enjoy it and
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.720]   maybe have a really nice coastal property or international property and then give a
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:27.480]   gift at the end.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:33.560]   I'm desperately struggling to remember the specifics on this and I knew the question
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.040]   was going and I meant to research it during the call.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.800]   I'll give you an answer and I'm caught flat footed.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:47.560]   If I had a phone screener, you wouldn't have gotten through because it causes me to do
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.560]   it.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.840]   I don't believe there's any reason why – it caused me to feel silly because I can't
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.360]   remember the answer at all.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.600]   I don't believe there's any reason why you can't own real estate in a charitable
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.120]   remainder trust.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:07.640]   A charitable remainder trust, yeah, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.440]   to own real estate in a charitable remainder trust.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:18.240]   Taxes in the future are going to probably skyrocket and the estate tax is probably going
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   to lower.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.920]   Just in your professional financial life, if you ran across maybe some high earners
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:34.400]   or wealthy people and what they might have done in their lifestyle, those of us that
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.400]   are workers wouldn't know about or would have availability to.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   All right.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.800]   So let's do this.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:47.080]   I don't want to be – I don't want to – in the last year I've done – the last
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.800]   couple of years, I've done zero estate planning.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:56.400]   So as such, I don't want to get this wrong in terms of going through and explaining it
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.440]   accurately especially with the benefits of it.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:06.400]   So I'm long overdue on talking about charitable remainder trust, a charitable lead trust,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:14.440]   a charitable remainder annuity trust and how to set – basically set some of them up and
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   some of the benefits.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.680]   So instead of my talking through it ad hoc and spontaneously and getting stuff wrong,
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.280]   I'm going to table this and come back to it.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:28.320]   I'll try to answer the question in a specific way that will be better for you instead of
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   me doing it off the top of my head.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.120]   But do you have a bonus question so I can redeem myself?
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   Anything else?
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.000]   The other thing, I do know that you're quite interested in investing in real estate as
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.560]   a landlord and I'm not at all at my stage in life.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.280]   But have you ever found a way or have you heard of a way to invest in real estate in
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.360]   a crowd source or group way when you don't personally want to be a landlord of property?
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   Yes.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.920]   There are a number of companies who are doing that.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.880]   I can't list any names off the top of my head.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.280]   But many people are taking the crowd sourcing model, the crowd funding model and trying
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.360]   to apply it to real estate.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:18.480]   Then of course there's also the fundamental way of doing it in the context of a real estate
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:24.200]   investment trust or mutual fund or some kind of entity like that.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.600]   My answer to that is always you have to ask yourself the question, "Why am I trying
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.800]   to invest in real estate in the first place?"
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.520]   Just for diversity.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.360]   Well, so let's talk about diversity.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:39.240]   So number one, most companies will own real estate.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   A moment ago we were talking about Coca-Cola.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.740]   Coca-Cola owns plenty of real estate.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.240]   Many companies own lots of real estate.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:54.520]   So there's always some real estate exposure that's fundamental in the ownership of stock
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.760]   in a certain company.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.040]   So that right there leads to some diversification.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:05.200]   Number two is depending on the type of real estate that you're going to invest in, there
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.240]   needs to be a specific strategy for it.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.800]   In general, real estate in general is, in my opinion and in my research, I believe real
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.480]   estate is basically going to always mirror inflation, especially when we're talking about
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.200]   residential real estate.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.400]   People are always going to pay in rents and in prices what they can afford based upon
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.680]   their wages.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.880]   Real estate is fundamentally a commodity that's based upon somebody's income.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.160]   And so it over time will match the rate of inflation.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:41.240]   As income goes up, then the rate of inflation will increase.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:46.160]   As wages inflate, then somebody's buying power to buy and pay a certain mortgage rate or
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.200]   to pay a certain rental rate, that will change based upon their wages.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.600]   You can't fake it for the long term.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   Right now where I live in Palm Beach County, Florida, recently they had a big real estate
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.080]   conference here in town in Palm Beach County because the median rent in Palm Beach County
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:10.840]   right now is $1,900 a month and the median home price is something like $350,000 a month.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.000]   I do not see how the local economy supports that.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.560]   I just don't see it.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.720]   And that's actually what some of the elected city officials and some of the local people
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   were trying to solve.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:28.800]   And they're talking about all kinds of things to try to bring in housing, new housing and
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.000]   try to improve things.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And this is actually a major problem in many of the largest, most productive cities that
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.960]   many of the cities have basically outlawed new development.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:44.520]   And the development cycle is so slow because we don't want new development.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.440]   This has led to massively high prices, which all this coming earlier in the show, we talked
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.520]   about the complacent class.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   He does a great job.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.400]   Tyler Cohen in that book does a great job of laying it out, how some of this is just
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:04.520]   really damaging people's ability to move and destroying the vibrancy of our national economy.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:09.600]   So real estate in a city is going to be driven based upon the wage growth in that city.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:15.280]   The reason that Los Angeles, California has such higher or San Diego, California has such
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:21.640]   higher, San Francisco has such higher real estate prices than Palm Beach County, Florida
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:28.240]   is because there's a wage base there that supposedly can protect that, can affect that.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.280]   So the fundamental – all of this to say, the fundamental advantage of real estate is
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.360]   often that it's a very inefficient market.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.040]   That's why individual real estate investors can do so well.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.680]   But you lose some of that if you go to a fund.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.280]   It's one thing for you as an individual to see another house on your block that you
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.080]   think is fairly priced to go and work out a deal with somebody and to buy the house
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.680]   from them and rent it out because you can see and possibly find a good investment.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:00.720]   It's one thing for a local real estate investor to see a property that's underutilized and
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.280]   try to come in and say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.480]   Let's see if we can improve this a little bit."
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.040]   But funds have a much harder time with that because as soon as you bureaucratize it and
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.600]   have your employees doing it, that's going to be a much harder time.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:20.320]   So here where I live, back in the last ten years, Blackstone, the hedge fund, came in
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.040]   and bought up scores and scores of houses.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.960]   They were doing it not because they could see an individual way for any individual house
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.120]   to necessarily grow, but they hired local people to find them deals.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:39.940]   But they basically were betting on the undervaluation of the market in general.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:44.440]   So forgive me if I'm being a little bit – I'm not being as clear in my answer as possible.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.240]   What I'm saying is I don't see a huge benefit of – to say we have to invest in real estate
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.520]   in the context of a fund just for diversification.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.960]   Sure, a few percent, that's fine.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.400]   Most of the large – if you're buying – if you're working with a large mainstream financial
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.040]   advisor, they'll put a few percent in real estate and some kind of real estate fund.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.400]   But I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:15.040]   I think it's easier for you just to look at your own life and say I own a $200,000
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   house in Iowa.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:21.080]   That's $200,000 in my portfolio that's exposed to real estate and to take it on a
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.840]   much simpler basis.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.000]   OK.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.560]   I don't personally own any real estate.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.480]   So that's why I'm kind of looking for some options.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   I would like that answer.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:39.600]   I mean it's imprecise because I don't see it as a – well, how do you answer – I
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.360]   don't know how to answer the question.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.160]   The analyst can probably answer it in terms of a perfect portfolio and they can stretch
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.240]   it out and say exactly how it should be.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.880]   But I don't know how to do that in the context of an individual.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:59.320]   I think real estate is probably better owned just where you can see it locally and I personally
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.800]   wouldn't worry too much about a fund.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   I'd go online.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.280]   There are a bunch of other crowdfunded platforms.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.520]   I got one more caller who just joined us, slipped in.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.160]   I forgot to lock the phone lines.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.160]   Welcome to the show.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   You got a question to ask?
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.160]   Hey Joshua.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:19.680]   First of all, thanks again so much for the show and no small part thanks to you.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.480]   I sat for my CFP at the end of last year and I got it.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   Congratulations.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   Thank you so much.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   Thank you, sir.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   I appreciate you.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.120]   Hey, quick question for you in regards to long-term care planning and that is do you
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:36.920]   have any kind of rule of thumb or guidelines that you used when you worked in that area
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:44.800]   in terms of either the asset level, someone is in between say $300,000 and $800,000 or
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:51.120]   something like that or a percentage of their income allocated toward the insurance in that
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.120]   regard.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.520]   Did you again have any kind of working rules of thumb or guidelines for that?
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.600]   I did.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.080]   I don't know if these rules of thumb are still valid.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.640]   There have been a lot of changes in long-term care and I'm getting rusty.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.600]   I probably need to get some policies and get some quotes and actually if any of you listeners
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:13.240]   are insurance agents who can run some quotes with different long-term care insurance companies
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.440]   under a few different scenarios and email them to me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.800]   I'd be indebted to you.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.720]   I'm getting a little bit rusty now with being out of the day-to-day for the last couple
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.440]   of years in terms of current prices.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.960]   There were a lot of changes that were happening when I left to start Radical Personal Finance.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.240]   But my rule of thumb was basically this and this is just a rule of thumb.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.600]   Before I do it, let me talk about how to actually plan it properly.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.160]   The best way to plan it properly is to pull it into some software and actually model the
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.280]   scenario and you have to model the scenario for the actual person.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:55.040]   Big difference between a married couple versus an individual person and the biggest benefit
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.200]   of long-term care insurance is that it will allow – when well-designed, it will allow
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:08.360]   a spouse who's sick to receive the care that they need while the spouse who is not
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:16.840]   sick can maintain the lifestyle or close to the lifestyle that together as a healthy couple,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.640]   the couple was enjoying.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.480]   It will basically help to keep from impoverishing the healthy spouse.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.800]   In my opinion, it's kind of the fundamental role of long-term care insurance.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:33.840]   It has other uses as well but it allows a couple to get needed medical care for a long-term
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.400]   care need without impoverishing the healthy spouse.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.520]   My rule of thumb was this.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:46.200]   If somebody had less than – and we're talking here people in their 40s, 50s, 60s,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.360]   kind of people who are serious retirement plan, not someone who's 30 years old but
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.980]   50s and 60s.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:58.960]   If somebody has or expects to have less than a few hundred thousand dollars saved for retirement,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:05.360]   let's call it $200,000 or $300,000, I really don't see how such a person can afford long-term
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   care insurance.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:12.000]   Unless there's some unknown scenario, they have a very high income or something, I just
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.640]   don't see how somebody with a few hundred thousand dollars – with less than a few
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.320]   hundred thousand dollars saved for retirement can afford long-term care insurance.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:29.200]   From the $300,000 range of assets up through let's call it $2 or $3 or $4 million, that's
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.920]   what I consider to be the sweet spot for where long-term care insurance can save a financial
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   plan.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.560]   Obviously with somebody with fewer assets, maybe a more minimal policy versus a big giant
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:49.360]   policy but that's where the long-term care can really save the plan.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.160]   So that was kind of the sweet spot, a million, a couple of million bucks saved, long-term
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.200]   care insurance makes a big difference there.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.520]   Beyond somewhere like $3, $4, $5 million of assets, I don't think it's really needed
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.960]   in terms of – it's hard to make the case to me that if you've got $5 million of assets
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.500]   that you really have to have long-term care insurance.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:15.960]   Certainly you could get early onset Alzheimer's and spend 20 years needing care but statistically
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.080]   that's improbable.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.680]   So I really shy away from trying to convince someone that you have to have it.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.760]   But I do think there's a really compelling case for somebody who's very wealthy that
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:34.200]   there's a significant risk and that risk can be mitigated with a little bit of money.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:40.040]   And by allocating a little bit of money, small, relative to the overall portfolio, that has
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.600]   a substantial insurance effect on the overall portfolio and it's probably a pretty good
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.080]   idea.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:50.320]   But that was kind of – those were my rules of thumb and that was how I talked about it
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   with actual clients.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.440]   If someone didn't have it, I would say, "Listen, let's talk about some Medicaid
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:52:00.680]   planning or let's talk about making sure that you – someone with $200,000, they need
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.800]   to do Medicaid planning, good Medicaid planning."
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.080]   But those were my rules of thumb.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.200]   Is that about kind of what you're feeling at this point in your financial planning career?
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.880]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:16.640]   However, also from like a budgetary perspective, would you use any guidelines as far as how
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:25.400]   much of their income to spend on premium or vice versa, how much coverage to purchase
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.840]   as like a percentage of their asset level, for example?
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.360]   Yeah, I don't know the answer to that.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.880]   I think that good fact-finding will help it to emerge.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.560]   I don't like spending money on insurance premiums.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.500]   I've found that there are people who worry about everything and love spending all kinds
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.420]   of money on insurance premiums and there are people who just don't want to spend anything
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.420]   on insurance premiums.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.080]   I personally am more towards the, "I don't want to spend money on insurance premiums."
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.880]   So with regard to the budget, I don't know how to do that with a rule of thumb or a percentage
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   basis.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:03.320]   There's a big difference between somebody with a $2,000 monthly retirement budget and
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.080]   somebody with a $10,000 monthly retirement budget.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.000]   I don't see that – I don't know a rule of thumb there that would be helpful.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.580]   What I would talk through is the person's risk and their goals because different people
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.320]   have different goals with their income.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:23.200]   If I ran into somebody who had a $10,000 monthly retirement income, was living on $3,000, which
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.080]   is not that uncommon in terms of somebody who has a very high income that they don't
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.880]   need, and their number one goal is to preserve their assets for the benefit of their children,
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:36.600]   their grandchildren or a favorite charitable bequest they want to make or something like
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:43.440]   that, then long-term care insurance can be a really valuable tool.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.640]   But I don't know how to bring that into a rule of thumb.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.240]   I think good fact-finding will emerge.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.120]   Is this a real concern for somebody?
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.320]   Is this something that they're worried about?
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.000]   Model the scenarios.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.360]   Model it and run the premiums and see.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:02.480]   There's a difference in premiums for somebody who's – this is the other thing.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.360]   By the time people actually start planning for long-term care, I never sold anybody who
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   was in their 60s a long-term care insurance policy because when I actually – when I
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:18.320]   ran the math, the premiums were so expensive that it just didn't ever seem to make sense.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:23.880]   I sold dozens and dozens of policies to people in their 50s, handfuls to people in their
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.480]   40s and 30s.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.300]   But by the time people reach 60 years old, in my experience, they could almost never
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.040]   swing that monthly nut.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.840]   Marc Thiessen: Gotcha.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   Okay.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.840]   Very good.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.840]   Thank you so much.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   Appreciate it.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.880]   Ted Galen Carpenter: I don't know of another subject other than long-term care insurance
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.400]   that will cause so many people to do it.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.920]   There's been huge – it caused so many arguments over things.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   The best way to do it is put it in the financial planning software and model the scenarios
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.600]   and ask the client what scenarios they'd like to model and the answers usually will
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.840]   be pretty self-evident.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:06.120]   November is long-term care insurance month in terms of what I'm intending to do with
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.600]   radical personal finance is to kind of move to a monthly themed approach to the show.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:17.440]   And so I've sketched out my topics for the coming year and a half and I may or may not
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.080]   do long-term care this November.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.080]   I might push it to next November.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:28.240]   But long-term care insurance month that the industry does, so lots of resources out there.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Market's changing.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   It's funny.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.600]   I actually own a long-term care policy on me and my wife has one on her that I bought
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.920]   when I was an agent and you could still get lifetime benefit.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   It's super cheap.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.280]   The nice thing about it, you can write it off in your business, the premiums.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:50.640]   And mine is super cheap but I actually have one of the few lifetime benefit policies right
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.480]   when Northwestern Mutual was closing that out and ending that.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.760]   I'm not aware of any companies who are still offering lifetime unlimited benefits.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.800]   Same thing happened with the disability marketplace a couple decades ago.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.480]   You used to be able to get massive disability policies that would come in for your entire
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.440]   life and the risk exposure was too high for the insurance companies and they lowered them
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.440]   out.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:18.400]   So there are times at which insurance products are mispriced and you can jump on them.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:24.960]   I had run out of music here but when I was selling long-term care insurance, there was
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:32.880]   one month where Northwestern Mutual was canceling the lifetime benefit policy and I called dozens
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:39.280]   and dozens of clients who had been interested in long-term care and I said, "Listen, this
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   is the deal."
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.340]   And thankfully I had several dozen of them that actually went ahead and bought policies.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:47.840]   So sometimes when your insurance agent calls you up and says, "Company's canceling this
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   benefit.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.920]   You got to go now.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   It's the real deal."
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.960]   Been there, done that in the long-term care marketplace.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.960]   That's enough for closing announcements.
