[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Tandy in Alabama writes in to ask, "In your book Desiring God, you quote Psalm 37, 4
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.240]   many times. Most of these references are to support the idea that joy is a command.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.880]   What does 'delight yourself in the Lord' mean practically?"
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:29.520]   It means first, Tandy, seeing Him as the most admirable person and reality in the universe.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.120]   Ironically, Ayn Rand, who was an atheist and wrote Atlas Shrugged, said something
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.400]   I think stunningly true. She said, "Admiration is the rarest of pleasures."
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:57.120]   Now in her mouth, I think that was pure cynicism, meaning she's already rejected God,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.680]   the source of all admiration and all admirability, and she can't see many people that she admires,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.280]   and so she's a cynic. But oh, how right she is that admiration is one of our greatest pleasures.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.360]   We love to admire sports figures and music figures and acting figures and admire beauty
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.320]   and admire sunsets and sunrises and mountains and rivers. We are admiring creatures to the core,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.280]   and I think we're wired to be satisfied by admiring the most admirable, and the most
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.720]   admirable is God, and therefore, "Delight yourself in the Lord" means delight yourself in seeing His
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.840]   infinite admirableness. For me, Jonathan Edwards has been a huge help here. He has observed that
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:08.640]   the beauty of Christ, the excellencies of Christ that satisfy the human longing for
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.280]   ultimate excellence and ultimate beauty and in them ultimate satisfaction,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:26.480]   those, he said, are seen most clearly when you observe the diverse excellencies or the
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.080]   surprising juxtaposition of seeming opposites in Christ. So I jotted down
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.120]   a little section from his sermon, "The Excellencies of Christ," to give to Andy a flavor
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.960]   of what I see when I'm delighting in Jesus. The person of Christ, he wrote, brings together
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   infinite highness and infinite condescension, infinite justice and infinite grace,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.600]   infinite glory and lowest humility, infinite majesty and transcendent meekness,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:17.760]   deepest reverence towards God and equality with God, infinite worthiness of good and greatest
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.680]   patience under suffering evil, exceeding spirit of obedience with supreme dominion over heaven
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.880]   and earth, absolute sovereignty and perfect resignation, self-sufficiency and entire trust
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:43.120]   and reliance upon God. And he's right. I mean, Edwards is right. When Paul says in 2 Corinthians
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.600]   4 that the devil keeps us from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.840]   image of God, he means the devil is in the business of killing our enjoyment of the beauty of Christ
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.320]   in the gospel. And the gospel is the place where the cross brings those diverse excellencies
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.600]   together most clearly. So that's number one. Delighting in God practically means
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:21.840]   seeing and savoring the diverse excellencies of God, especially as they are manifest in Christ,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.680]   especially as he brings them to fulfillment at the cross. But here's the second thing I'd say,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   and I think I only have two more. Know this God as your intimate, caring savior and friend.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.480]   And here's why I say that. I have often said in many contexts, no one goes to the Grand Canyon
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   to increase his self-esteem. We go to the Grand Canyon. Why? People do. They go to the Grand
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.680]   Canyon. And if they can't go there, they buy a big glossy book and put it on their coffee table.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.920]   Why? Because standing at a Grand Canyon and watching this vast, cavernous,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.960]   open space that goes down a mile into the ground with a tiny little river down there at the bottom,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.760]   which is a massive river, it does something to our souls because God made us to know him as the
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:30.160]   great Grand Canyon. Tony, what happened when I've told that? A woman said to me one time that was
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.600]   so illuminating to me. She said, "Well, yes, but it's hard to enjoy the Grand Canyon if you feel
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:49.920]   you might fall over the edge and be killed by the Grand Canyon." I thought, "That's right.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:59.200]   She's absolutely right. If we don't have, in addition to seeing and savoring the Grand Canyon,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:08.000]   a sweet sense that the Canyon's not going to kill us..." I'll shift my metaphor off the Canyon
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.880]   onto Jesus. If God and Jesus are not for us, if they're not in love with us, if they're not our
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.120]   friend, if they're not our savior, if they're not kind to us and caring for us and protecting us,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.320]   we won't have the capacity to see the Grand Canyon as beautiful. We'll just be terrified.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.080]   We will be locked up inside our fears and we won't be able to know him and enjoy him.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   From the time I was a sophomore in college, Galatians 2.20 has served me like that.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.280]   I am crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. In the life that
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.800]   I now live, in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God. Then I pause, I take a deep breath,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:02.480]   "Who loved me, who loved me." It's one of the few places where Paul uses the singular personal
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.400]   pronoun for how Jesus relates to him and not just us. "He loved me and gave himself for me." That's
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.600]   what Paul said. So I just transfer that over onto me. And just recently, Tony, in my devotions,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.720]   just I think maybe two days ago it was, I read in Revelation 2. No, it was more than two days ago
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:29.360]   because I'm at Revelation 11 now. So it was nine days ago. I read chapter 2 verse 17 where Jesus
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:38.320]   says, "I will give him," so I'm reading John Piper. He says, "John, I will give you a white stone
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:46.480]   someday with a new name written on it that no one knows except the one who receives it." Why does he
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   say that, Tony? Why does he say that? He says it because he wants to assure me you're not a number
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:04.080]   in the system. You're not a cog in the great wheel of providence. I have you in mind. I have a name
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   for you, and I want you and me to have the kind of relationship that there are things about it
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:19.440]   nobody else knows. That is simply breathtaking. So my second thing for Tandy is to say that
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   delighting in God means delighting in his love for me and delighting in the fact that he cares
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.520]   for me and will protect me and means to have that kind of intimate personal relationship with me.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:39.920]   And I suppose I shouldn't stop without saying we delight in God through what he's made.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:47.120]   The heavens are telling the glory of God, and we did a podcast about food and sex and said they're
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.480]   really God's gifts, and we're supposed to receive them with thanksgiving and turn them into an
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.680]   occasion of worship. And so all through the day, every good thing that gives us pleasure should be
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:07.200]   an instance of delighting in God. So let me say those three again. Seeing and savoring him is
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:16.080]   infinitely admirable. Embracing him as your dearest friend, Savior, caring protector, provider,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.000]   and thirdly, receive with thanks and worship everything he gives you.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.400]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast. Please email your
