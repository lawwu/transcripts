[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.480]   in Paul's first epistle to Timothy, the first chapter, and I shall read from verse 12 to
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.540]   verse 16.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.160]   From verse 12 to verse 16 in the first chapter of Paul's first epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.200]   And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:38.520]   putting me into the ministry, who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.800]   But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.600]   And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.700]   This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.860]   world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.560]   How be it for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.640]   all longsuffering, for a pattern, to them which should hereafter believe on him to everlasting
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.640]   life.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.580]   I want again in particular to deal with that statement in the thirteenth verse, "who was
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.700]   before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.580]   But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief."
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.940]   Now we are considering for the fourth time the case of this great and mighty apostle
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.060]   Paul.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.920]   This conversion.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.380]   You will notice that in many places in the New Testament references are made to this
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.460]   great and climactic event.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.580]   We have read an account of it this evening in the twenty-sixth chapter of the book of
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.580]   the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.100]   It is but one of three accounts which is given of it in that one book.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.780]   And then we have seen that you have an account of it there in that first epistle to Timothy.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.460]   We consider it also, as you find it in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.980]   It is one of those great central pivotal facts and events without which there is a sense
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.740]   in which we cannot clearly understand the Christian faith at all.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.740]   Now I must not keep you tonight with preliminaries.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.980]   It is very tempting to do so in the case of this man, Oliver.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.060]   But I would hurriedly put this to your consideration.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.860]   That whatever your view may be of Christianity as such, if you are interested in life at
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.780]   all, if you are interested in the history of the world in any sense, you have got to
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.260]   come face to face with the case of this man.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.060]   Because he is one of those men that has left his mark and his impress upon the whole course
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.860]   of human history.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.860]   He is one of the great minds of the ages, one of those outstanding personalities.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.700]   And therefore I say that we are driven, if we are at all serious about life, to consider
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.740]   the case of this man.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.860]   But we are considering it like this on these Sunday evenings for a slightly different reason.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.420]   We are interested in it as it gives us an insight into and an understanding of this
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.780]   great change which goes by the name of conversion.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.700]   This extraordinary thing that happens to men and women and that makes them cease to be
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.020]   non-Christians and makes of them Christians.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.980]   That is why we are interested in it.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:08.340]   Here is this man, this apostle Paul, this great man, this outstanding Christian, this
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.140]   man who had such amazing experiences in his own life.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.140]   This man who has discovered the secret of living to such an extent that he is a master
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.700]   of life.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.300]   Not mastered by it, but mastering it.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.700]   There is that perfect example of that in this 26th chapter of Acts that we read at the beginning.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.940]   Look at him again standing in that court before King Agrippa and Queen Bernice and this Roman
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.980]   proconsul Festus.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.460]   There they are in all their wealth and affluence and there he stands before them with the chains
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.300]   hanging from his wrists.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060]   And you remember what he says to them.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.220]   He is standing there as a prisoner at the bar as it were, looks at them and says this,
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.900]   I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.900]   and altogether such as I am.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.900]   Except these bonds.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.420]   He was a perfect gentleman.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.860]   He didn't wish them to be imprisoned.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.580]   He didn't want them to have the chains hanging upon their wrists.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.460]   But he says he'd give anything if only they became as he is.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.240]   He's happier in prison than they are out of prison.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.220]   With everything going against him, he's got a joy that they can't even imagine.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.500]   They know nothing about it.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.860]   Now here I say is this astounding man with his wonderful life, this great benefactor
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.180]   to others, this man who was so loved by the churches that we read that when he was saying
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.340]   farewell to the people of the church at Ephesus, they hung about his neck and they wept because
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.020]   he told them that they'd never see him again, this man who endured himself to all because
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.740]   of his sympathy, his largeness of heart, because of his message, because of what his coming
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.140]   into their lives had meant to them.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.220]   What an astounding life.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.660]   He's a Christian.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.100]   And I confess I don't quite understand the person who doesn't want to be like that.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.420]   I'm preaching on the assumption that you would like to be like that, that you're tired of
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.660]   the struggle and the fight, and that you would give the whole world if you could not be as
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   this man was.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.820]   Well, that's why we're considering his case.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.660]   Because you see, the fact is this, that there was once a time when this man was very far
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.140]   indeed removed from all that.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.580]   He tells it us himself with shame.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.860]   He was a blasphemer, a persecutor.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.100]   He was injurious.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.980]   He tells us in this 26th chapter that we read at the beginning how he was breathing out
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.460]   his threatenings.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.140]   He gave his vote against these saints, these Christians who were condemned to death.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.860]   He delighted in doing it.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.180]   He was busy in it.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.380]   He gave himself to it with all the intensity of his great nature.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.820]   That's how he once was, but he's no longer like that.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:20.020]   Well, now the question is this, isn't it?
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.340]   What was it that kept this man back from Christianity?
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.380]   What was it that kept him as the persecutor, the blasphemer that he was, and the injurious
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.780]   person that he was?
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.780]   What was it?
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.140]   Well, we've been trying to answer that question.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.660]   We've given some reasons for that.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.500]   We've seen very clearly that these were some of them, that he was relying upon his nationality,
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.180]   relying upon the fact that he was a Jew.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.980]   We saw that he was relying also upon his astounding ability.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:55.760]   We saw that he was relying also upon his sincerity, and we saw that he was relying upon his religion,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.700]   if you like, his religiosity.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.500]   Not only that, we saw last Sunday night that there was something at the back of all those
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.300]   things.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:13.060]   And what we saw was at the back of those other things was this, his ignorance.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:19.420]   I obtained mercy, says Paul, though I was a persecutor and a blasphemer and injurious.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:25.700]   I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.620]   And we spent our time last Sunday night in analyzing that ignorance, not giving our ideas
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.940]   as to his ignorance, but giving his own statements with respect to it.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.540]   And we should thank God that this man not only tells us about what happened to him,
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.820]   he analyzes it.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.340]   There's no doubt about why he was like that.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.780]   He tells us himself.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.380]   He displays the ignorance.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.460]   He opens and bears his soul before us, as it were, and he told us that he had been ignorant
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.460]   about himself.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.700]   I put it like this.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:01.340]   I said he was ignorant of his ignorance, and there's nothing worse than that.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.860]   If a man knows he's ignorant, you can do something with him.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.380]   The man who's really impossible is the man who doesn't know he's ignorant, the man who
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.700]   thinks he knows everything.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.540]   That's why a little learning is a dangerous thing.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:21.180]   We saw that he was also ignorant of the law of God on which he thought he was an expert,
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.460]   and ignorant of God himself whom he thought he worshipped.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.180]   We saw likewise that he was ignorant of the true nature and character of sin, what he
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.220]   calls himself in the Seventh of Romans, the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.620]   He didn't know anything about it.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.900]   And finally we saw that he was ignorant of the mercy of God.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.580]   As a self-satisfied, proud, contented Pharisee, he'd never seen any need of God's mercy,
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.180]   and he knew nothing at all about it.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.220]   What a terrible thing ignorance is.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:01.220]   And the appalling thing that the Bible tells us is that what takes men and women eventually
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.980]   to hell is but ignorance.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.780]   However, the apostle goes on to tell us in that selfsame thirteenth verse of that first
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.940]   chapter of the first epistle to Timothy, that it wasn't only ignorance.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:26.140]   I did it, he says, ignorantly, in unbelief.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.260]   Now he doesn't say a thing like that just for the sake of saying it.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.440]   He says it wasn't only ignorance, it was unbelief.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.820]   I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.080]   Here is something further, then, that gives us an insight into this, men.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.580]   And I need scarcely say, surely, as we come to consider this condition that he describes
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:52.100]   as unbelief, that we are looking at it tonight, oh, not because we've got some general biographical
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.740]   interest in Paul, not because we're interested in psychological analysis.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.900]   These things are perfectly interesting, I admit.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.540]   But I'm calling your attention to them not for that reason.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:07.060]   I'm calling attention to them for this reason, that if I'm speaking as I know I am at this
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.540]   moment to those who are not Christian, my friend, the fact, the thing that explains
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.340]   why you are still not a Christian is this, that you are ignorant and that you are in
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.980]   a state of unbelief.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   It's always the same.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   Paul says, "I'm a pattern.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.980]   I'm an example.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.980]   I am being set forth so that all shall see me.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:36.020]   I there am a sort of illustration of this whole process of conversion and of salvation."
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.220]   Therefore, if it was ignorance and unbelief in his case, it is ignorance and unbelief
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.460]   in the case of all others who are still not Christians in this world tonight.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.300]   Very well, let's look at this second term, ignorance, unbelief.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.820]   Now this is a term that you'll find that is used very frequently in the Scripture.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:05.180]   And therefore it's a term which we must be at great pains to understand and know exactly
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.980]   what it means and what it represents.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.980]   What is unbelief?
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.980]   That's the question.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:17.620]   If I say that a man who's not a Christian is not a Christian because, like the Apostle
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.180]   Paul, he is guilty of ignorance in unbelief, what is unbelief?
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.580]   Well now, let me put it like this.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.500]   The first thing we've got to say about it in the light of the Scriptural teaching is
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:34.620]   that it is a state or a condition.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.700]   It is a state or a condition of soul.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:45.740]   Now let me try to expand that by putting it, first of all, negatively.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   Unbelief is not merely a matter of intellect or of ability or of understanding.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:03.540]   Now there are many who think that the whole determining factor in this question as to
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.700]   whether one is a Christian or whether one is not a Christian is just this question of
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:16.300]   intelligence, of intellect, and of understanding.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.660]   We needn't waste any time with this.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:22.060]   We're all perfectly familiar, I'm certain, with the position.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.460]   There is a common assumption in the minds of most people today, certainly all those
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:35.860]   who are not Christians, that some of or another, the determining factor is this matter of intellect
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.140]   and of intelligence.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:47.020]   The idea is that rarely intelligent and intellectual people are not Christian.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.100]   And therefore, of course, it follows of necessity and logically, doesn't it, that those of
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:57.140]   us who are Christians are Christians because we are more or less unintelligent.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.140]   Not intellectual.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.020]   Now, I'm not here to manufacture cases.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.980]   I'm suggesting to you that that is the common assumption today.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:12.980]   That any people of intellect and of understanding and of ability have long since ceased to be
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.540]   interested in this because of their intellect.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:24.980]   And that therefore the others still believe it because they're lacking in that respect.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:30.460]   I remember very well as a boy a perfect illustration of this because I'm anxious to make this
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:37.340]   point clear that this attitude is not confined to those who are not Christian.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:44.260]   Alas, far too often I have heard Christian people give their whole case away quite unconsciously
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.660]   in this way.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:55.500]   I remember in the village where I had the privilege of being brought up, there was a
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:05.340]   local squire, country gentleman if you like, and his son had not only been to the nearby
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.020]   university but had gone on from there to Oxford.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.100]   And he had taken his degree at Oxford.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.940]   And I still remember it very well.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.860]   Walking home from chapel one Sunday morning, I was listening to a number of faithful Christian
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:31.020]   members of that church talking to one another and expressing their amazement that this extraordinary
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.820]   wonderful man, this great intellect, who'd been through his Welsh university and now
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.340]   through Oxford, should still come to chapel.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.900]   They felt that it was very wonderful on his part.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.780]   It was a great act of condescension.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.940]   He must have been a very fine man.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.940]   How marvelous, how wonderful that this great intellect should still be interested in these
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.940]   things.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.580]   Now that was the kind of impression that even Christian people had got.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.100]   And they were rather amazed that he still did it.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.340]   It's a very common assumption this.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:12.020]   But surely the case of the Apostle Paul alone, without going any further, shows how completely
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:18.180]   and utterly ridiculous that attitude is in this way.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:26.260]   Here is a man who has precisely the same intellect and intellectual capacity before and after.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.420]   Exactly the same.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.500]   Can you prove to me that the Apostle Paul was more able and intelligent and intellectual
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.780]   before his conversion than after?
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.980]   What's your evidence for it?
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.900]   There isn't a shred of evidence.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.300]   Indeed I can take you to his epistles and I can invite you to read them with me and
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.780]   to study them with me.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.180]   And I can say this to you, that if you come with me through those epistles, it'll tax
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.660]   your intellectual equipment to its absolute limit.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.220]   And even then you'll be soaring ahead of you.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.340]   The great minds and the intellects of the centuries have tried to grapple with this
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:10.580]   tremendous thinking and they've left us children far behind.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.900]   How foolish we are.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.420]   The man, I say, has precisely the same intellect afterwards as before, and he gives evidence
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.420]   of that.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.820]   He uses it, he implies it.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.580]   He didn't suddenly cease to be intellectual afterwards.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.860]   There's tremendous argument, there's great logic here, it's full of reasoning.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.740]   You've got to be wide awake when you read Paul's epistles.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.500]   That's why most people don't read them.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.580]   They find they're too much for them.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.380]   They're accustomed to novels, you see.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.940]   They want something light and entertaining.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.500]   "Oh, they say this is too much, it's too difficult."
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.380]   Quite right, it is.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.140]   It's so intellectual.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.020]   It's too intellectual, as I'm saying, for most.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.940]   No, no, the argument is monstrous.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.020]   It's ridiculous, it's against the evidence.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:18:01.860]   The intellect is here in all its power and in all its wealth.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.500]   But you see, I needn't stop at the case of the Apostle Paul.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   I could show you exactly the same in the case of every other great saint that has ever adorned
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.700]   the life of the Church.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.300]   Look at a man like Augustine again.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.100]   Of course, a brilliant intellect before his conversion.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.460]   Yes, but still a brilliant intellect after his conversion.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.220]   Did you know that some of the things that that man wrote after his conversion are really
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:34.540]   controlling the historical outlook of some of the greatest thinkers today?
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.780]   Nothing perhaps profounder has ever been written about life and the course of history in this
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:46.020]   world than the writing of Saint Augustine on the City of God.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.780]   If you really want to understand what's happening historically at this present time, go back
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.780]   and read it.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.820]   There it is, after the conversion, the mighty, gigantic intellect is there and operating
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:02.020]   fully and clearly, as he would have said much more so after than before.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:08.060]   And then take another argument for me to dismiss this aspect of the question.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   How often have we known two men of equal ability?
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.660]   There they are, perhaps two brothers or perhaps two friends.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.180]   They've gone to the same school.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.060]   It was always neck and neck, one time, one term, one of them was top and the other second,
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.340]   the next term, the second was top and the other man was second.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.540]   They went on like that right through their school.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.740]   They went to the university.
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.100]   They both took first.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.500]   You couldn't tell the difference.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.100]   Their professors, their examiners could never tell which really was the finer intellect
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.220]   in all the subjects that they studied.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.340]   Yet one of them was a Christian and the other wasn't.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.340]   You've known that, haven't you?
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.340]   You've known it often.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.900]   Do you still say it's a question of intellect?
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:55.100]   There was nothing to choose between the two men intellectually, and yet there, I say,
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.820]   is that obvious difference.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.860]   One is a Christian and one isn't a Christian.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.380]   My friends, it can't be a matter of intellect.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.380]   I'll go further.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.620]   It isn't a matter of intellect.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.620]   It's a state.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.500]   It's a condition of soul.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.940]   That's what unbelief is.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.180]   I was in unbelief.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:20.580]   It's a condition, a whole state of being, not merely intellectual.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.180]   I mustn't keep you with this.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:28.200]   You know, we attribute far too much to the intellect in this world.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.940]   When you come to think of it at all deeply, you really are almost forced to the conclusion
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:39.620]   that the intellect comes very little into our differences and distinctions.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.860]   Take political differences, for instance.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.940]   Are those differences determined by intellect?
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.940]   Of course they're not.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.420]   Why not the man belonging to his particular party says he can prove it, he can demonstrate
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.980]   it, it's reasonable, well, it's unintelligent not to be this.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.900]   Yes, but you see, the man about whom he says that is equally intelligent and is saying
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.580]   exactly the same thing about him.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.220]   Whatever else determines the political party to which you belong tonight, let me assure
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.820]   you it isn't your intellect.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.220]   It's something much more elemental than that.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.300]   We try to find the arguments to buttress up and to substantiate what we already believe
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.540]   in terms of something much more fundamental.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:31.740]   Well, I say if it's like that almost in every realm, it is particularly true in the
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.140]   case of the Christian faith with which we are concerned tonight.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.780]   But let me hurry to a second negative.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.780]   As it is not a matter of intellect, neither is it a matter of scholarship nor a matter
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   of knowledge.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.380]   Ah, you see, somebody might say to me, "I quite agree with that first point.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.980]   I would never have said it was merely a matter of intellect.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.380]   To me it's a matter of scholarship."
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.380]   That's the trouble.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.100]   You say, "Those people, those of you who still believe the Bible as the Word of God,
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.140]   the whole Bible and not certain parts of it, of course the difficulty with you is you're
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.980]   lacking in scholarship.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.660]   You just don't know enough, if only you'd read the books and if you'd only studied,
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.100]   if only you'd had this information put before you, you'd never take that position."
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.460]   They say scholarship is now a—scholars, that's the term—scholars now are agreed
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.500]   in saying the latest advance of knowledge and so on.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.740]   It's a matter, they say, of scholarship and of knowledge.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.100]   But again, surely the argument is exactly the same.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:39.580]   There are men of equal scholarship and of learning and of knowledge on both sides.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.220]   And that's an argument which is final once and forever.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.420]   I remember once being involved with a so-called scholar on these matters and he challenged
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.420]   me with it.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.940]   He said, "Can you name me a single scholar anywhere in the world that agrees with your
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.940]   position?"
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:02.540]   And he immediately named a man, the late Professor J. Gresham Machen of America.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.740]   And he hesitated.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.100]   I said, "Do you dispute his scholarship?"
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.300]   "Well, no," he said, "I've got to grant his scholarship, but I think he's wrong-headed."
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.860]   But my dear friend, I said, "We're not discussing whether he was right or wrong-headed.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.340]   You challenged me in this way.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.700]   You said, 'Can you name me one scholar of any standing?'
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.700]   And I've named you one and I can name you a dozen."
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.540]   No, no, it isn't a question of scholarship.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.980]   The scholars are on this side as well as on the other side.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.100]   It isn't information, it isn't knowledge.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.100]   Don't believe that lie.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.460]   It is not a matter of knowledge and of scholarship.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.580]   It's monstrous to suggest it is.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.980]   It's simply personal abuse and not argument.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.820]   And then let me come on to a third, which is this.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.020]   It is not a question of mental balance.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:04.100]   It's not a question of suffering from a complex or being free from a complex.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.420]   You're familiar with what I'm saying at this point, aren't you?
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.340]   "Yes," says somebody, "all right, I'll grant you your first two points.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.100]   We needn't waste time over them.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.940]   I'll grant you it isn't a matter of intellect.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.980]   It isn't a matter of scholarship."
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.420]   "No, no," says this man, "I've never taken that view.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.660]   What I've always said is this, that it's a question of psychology.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.740]   And that what really determines this is that the man is guilty of some sort of a psychological
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.740]   disturbance."
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.660]   Now that's the modern way of putting it.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.740]   It wasn't the way exactly in which the pro-consul Festus put it.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.500]   He put it a little more bluntly.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.820]   He said this.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.420]   As Paul thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, thou art beside
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.940]   thyself.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.340]   Much learning doth make thee mad."
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.180]   He's a lunatic.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:01.220]   Well, you know, some of these great scholars so-called have been at great pains to try
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.980]   and explain Paul's conversion.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:10.800]   In these terms they say that he was an epileptic, that he suffered from epilepsy, and that he
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.020]   and people who suffer from epilepsy and are liable to epileptic trips have these kind
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.020]   of hallucinations.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.220]   Of course, that's perfectly true.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.220]   They do.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.300]   So because of that they say that Paul suffered from epilepsy.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.380]   I still haven't had the data necessary to arrive at such a diagnosis.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.180]   It's simply a theory, a supposition with nothing at all to substantiate it.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.580]   It's simply an attempt to explain it away.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.660]   Madness, epilepsy, beside himself, got a religious complex, gone soft.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.660]   These are the terms, aren't they?
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.660]   You're familiar with them.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:49.460]   That a man suddenly has had some emotional crisis, some emotional experience.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:55.060]   Now let's be quite clear and frank about all this.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.620]   There are such things as hallucinations.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.420]   There are such states as these psychological conditions.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:12.300]   There are, I'll even go as far as this if you like, there are such things as complexes.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.500]   What I mean by that is this, that it is possible for people to be carried away by their feelings
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.780]   in an utterly unintelligent manner.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:24.100]   It is possible for certain physical conditions to do certain things to us and to give us
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.540]   things that simulate an experience of conversion.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:31.340]   I'll grant you all that fully.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.140]   I'm not here to say that men and women have never been deluded and have never thought
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.380]   they were right when they were wrong.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.020]   Of course, I grant it all.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.960]   I'm very familiar with all that.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.900]   But what I am concerned to say is this, that before you think you can dismiss the Apostle
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.300]   Paul and his experience along those lines or that of any other Christian, well then
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.420]   I say you'd better wait a bit and examine the evidence and not jump to conclusions.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.100]   There are certain tests that we can apply in these cases.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.980]   And the test to apply is the test of the subsequent life.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:10.740]   The test to apply is subsequent conduct and behavior.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.780]   People who suffer from certain physical conditions, yes, they behave in a certain way as the result
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.340]   of that.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.700]   We needn't go into it in detail.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.100]   I could go with you into it in detail if you so desired.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.580]   But I say that there is a very simple test that can be applied.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.300]   And these people who are carried away in emotional riots or who are carried away by some other
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.580]   spirits apply the test of life, my friends.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.740]   You see, a man may be singing hymns at one moment and enjoying them, and in an ecstasy
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.740]   he has lost himself.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.980]   He may go out and commit some appalling sin.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.060]   I am not here to defend things like that.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.060]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:52.300]   There's a very good way of testing and discriminating between the true and the false.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.580]   And the Bible is full of this sort of testing.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.620]   Oh, the test is the life.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:04.260]   Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, but he that doeth the will of my Father which
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.260]   is in heaven.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.740]   Not the man who is always shouting in his ecstasy.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:14.140]   No, no, the man who is keeping the commandments, who is walking the narrow path, who has denied
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:18.140]   himself and has taken up the cross and is following Christ.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.660]   That's the test.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.100]   Apply it in the case of this man, Paul.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.900]   Does he suggest to you a man who is lacking in balance?
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:35.180]   Is he a man who is just an emotionalist who has been carried away and has had an hallucination
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.860]   on the road and has been more or less made mad by that?
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:45.380]   Well, all I can say is this, if this is madness, as someone said before me, "Oh, blessed
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.380]   epilepsy!
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.340]   Oh, blessed madness!"
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:58.140]   Apply these tests of rationality, of morality and of ethics, of saintliness and purity and
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.140]   godliness.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.980]   These are the tests.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.460]   And when you apply them, you see that this suggestion, that this process of conversion,
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.460]   this great event, is not something that can be dismissed in terms of lack of mental balance
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.460]   or anything else, and that the man who is not a Christian is just a man who is sane
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.220]   and who is balanced and who has kept himself in a state of poise and who has got himself
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.220]   under marvelous control.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.620]   That's the suggestion, that the non-Christian is controlled and the Christian is a man who
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.140]   has lost his balance and lost his self-control.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.140]   I apologize for having kept you with these negatives, but it's essential that we should
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.700]   meet what is being said so constantly and ignorantly at the present time.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.660]   "No, no," I say, "it isn't a matter of intellect, it isn't a matter of culture
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.860]   and of knowledge, it isn't a matter of mental stability."
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.860]   Well, what is it?
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:30:00.140]   Unbelief is a condition, it's a state in which the mind and the judgment and the whole
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:07.500]   personality are so dominated by another power that the man is rendered incapable of thinking
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   straightly.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:16.140]   Now I'm being positive, I'm coming to the attack.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.420]   The Apostle Paul puts it again so perfectly in one of his phrases in his second epistle
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.300]   to the Corinthians and in the fourth chapter, this is how he puts it.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:34.380]   "If our gospel be hid," he says, "it is hid to them who are lost, in whom the
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:41.820]   God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest they believe the
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.820]   glorious gospel of Christ."
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.820]   That's it.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:52.260]   It's a condition, it's a state that is produced in these people by the God of this
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:58.420]   world who holds them captive and who prevents their believing, who bludgeons the mind, who
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:04.260]   blinds the understanding so that they can't say, "That's unbelief."
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.260]   How does it work?
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:11.180]   Well, let me give you the simple answer that is given in this bit of autobiography that
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.500]   we have in this 26th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.900]   The Apostle tells us there exactly how it worked in his case.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.260]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.140]   This is what we've got to explain.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.540]   Look at that man Saul of Tarsus.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.920]   He's a persecutor, he's a blasphemer, he's injurious.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.180]   He doesn't believe the gospel, he's not a Christian.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.420]   He's persecuting them and trying to put them out of existence.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.420]   What's his position?
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.300]   Well, here is the position, isn't it?
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:48.980]   He is confronted by certain facts that are absolutely plain and clear.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.640]   Now he says that later on in his life when he's become a preacher.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.300]   He says that, you remember, to this King Agrippa.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:01.740]   He says, "For the King knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely, for
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:07.780]   I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.900]   in a corner."
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.620]   In other words, the facts concerning Christianity are well known.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.440]   They had been staring Paul in the face.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.260]   He had been hearing about this teacher Jesus of Nazareth, what he said, what he claimed,
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   what he'd been doing.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.580]   He'd heard it all.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.780]   He was quite familiar with it.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.220]   The reports had come to him.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.620]   He said, "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.540]   the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.540]   He'd heard about him.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:42.740]   The facts were there, staring him in the face.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.540]   As they are there staring all who are non-Christians in the face.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:53.020]   The message of the Bible, the story of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, all about him.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.780]   It's here in an open Bible.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.220]   It confronted Paul.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.940]   It's confronting you tonight if you're an unbeliever.
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.100]   It's confronting the whole world.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.100]   There are the facts.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.220]   Perfectly clear.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.580]   But not only that, there are certain other facts.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.540]   Facts concerning the saints.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.780]   The apostle Paul knew these Christians.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.060]   He saw what had happened to them, the change in their lives, and yet he persecuted them.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.060]   He saw Stephen.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.660]   You remember the event, don't you?
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.540]   They were going to stone Stephen, one of these great Christians.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.500]   The apostle Paul stood by watching, and the people put their clothes at his feet while
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.900]   they went to stone this martyr.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:43.660]   As he was being stoned, his face began to shine with a radiance from heaven itself.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.260]   He saw Jesus, and he spoke to him.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.460]   Paul stood, and he saw it all.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.420]   He saw that face of Stephen shining with a brightness such as he had never seen before.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.420]   He knew the life.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.100]   He'd heard the message.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:03.340]   He was familiar with that.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.300]   And it's true of everybody tonight, again, who is not a Christian.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   The story of the Christian church is there.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:18.660]   The story of the martyrs, the story of the confessors, the story of all these saints
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:23.460]   throughout the centuries who've given their lives for Christ and have been the greatest
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.780]   benefactors that the world has ever known.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.780]   It's all there.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.500]   Say what you like against Christianity.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.820]   If you take out Christianity, what would your world have been like?
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.540]   We boast about our education.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.820]   Would we ever have had it if there hadn't been a Christian church, do you think?
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.500]   It's been the greatest civilizing force the world has ever known, apart from anything
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   else.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.780]   We are proud of our state hospitals, rightly so.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.140]   But let me remind you that it was the Christian church that started them.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.100]   We're proud of our poor law system.
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.860]   Yes, but who started it three centuries ago and more?
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.140]   The Christian church.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.900]   All the most beneficent things the world has ever known, they've come from Christian
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   people.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.460]   There are the facts.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:18.700]   And they're sparing the non-Christian in the face.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.820]   Well then, the question to ask is this, isn't it?
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.340]   Why is it that men don't believe?
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.300]   Why didn't Saul of Tarsus believe?
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.260]   He'd heard of Jesus and his works.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.460]   He'd seen Stephen and his death.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   He knew the facts.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.460]   They were all there.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.460]   The modern man has them all before him.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.460]   Why doesn't he believe?
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.460]   What's the matter?
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:51.100]   It's this terrible state and condition called unbelief that blinds, that holds in
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.740]   a kind of vice, and renders the man incapable.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.180]   How does it work?
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.860]   Let me just notice what the apostle tells us.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.820]   It always starts, of course, by producing prejudices.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820]   What is a prejudice?
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.620]   Well, a prejudice means that you prejudge the issue.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.260]   A prejudice means that you've tried the case and given your verdict before you've
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.260]   even gone to court.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.740]   It means that you've already said, "It must be this, and I don't care what's
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.940]   said, it's going to be this."
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.460]   Prejudice.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.820]   It colors everything.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.300]   It puts this coating over everything that's presented to it.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.900]   It'll twist facts.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.060]   It will manipulate them.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.860]   It's extraordinarily clever.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.380]   The apostle puts it here in a memorable phrase, you remember, "I verily thought
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.380]   with myself."
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.660]   Of course, he was his own accomplice.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.940]   He was agreeing with himself.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.660]   He was manipulating it all, and he could take the facts and twist them, and make them fit
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.660]   in as he thought, onto his side.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.860]   I needn't keep you with this.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.700]   We've all done it, haven't we, and done it so often?
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.020]   Every man can always explain away his own sin.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.180]   He'll condemn it in another.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.540]   It's all right in his case.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.060]   There's always something different.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.020]   That's what we call rationalizing our sins.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.700]   It's because we start with a prejudice.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.180]   It's because we've already decided on the verdict.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.420]   And though we are given facts, we'll twist them.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.980]   Though we are given these cases, it makes no difference at all.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.740]   Prejudice comes in.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:24.540]   And the apostle was prejudiced to the very hilt.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.860]   As a Jew, as a Pharisee, as a religious Jew, his prejudice was compelling him.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:36.860]   And though the facts were there, he somehow didn't see them.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:42.980]   We talk on the other side about seeing things through rose-tinted spectacles, don't we?
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:48.860]   How true it is.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.220]   Our own case is different.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.980]   Our children are different.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.740]   We'll defend them when they're wrong.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.860]   We'd condemn the same thing in somebody else's children.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   And so on.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.300]   Yes, this fundamental thing, you see, that it doesn't matter whether you put facts in
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.420]   front of it or not, it won't see them.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.420]   Prejudice has come in.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:12.860]   But secondly, there was also false dogmatism.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.540]   When I say false dogmatism, I'm interpreting what the apostle puts in these words.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:23.100]   He turns upon these people and he says, "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:27.740]   you that God should raise the dead?"
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.140]   You see, these people were saying that it was incredible and that because it was incredible
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.260]   it couldn't happen and because it couldn't happen it hadn't happened.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.980]   It was nothing but sheer dogmatism.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.760]   It simply laid down a postulate.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.920]   It was unreasonable.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.500]   It was irrational.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.500]   It was quite illogical.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.500]   They said, "This thing can't happen.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   God cannot raise the dead.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   It's incredible."
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:59.700]   And that's just a sheer piece of dogmatism.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.260]   You see, if they'd stopped to think and to reason, they'd have said this.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.740]   These people, remember, believed in God.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.380]   These opponents of Paul, they believed in God.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.740]   The Sadducees especially, they believed in God but they didn't believe in miracles and
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.140]   they didn't believe in the resurrection.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.060]   They said it's impossible.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.980]   And yet they said they believed in God.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.820]   And Paul says, "Look here, if you believe in God, you believe he's almighty.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.300]   And if he's almighty, nothing is impossible with him.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.100]   And therefore he can resurrect the dead.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:31.300]   Why do you say it's incredible therefore?"
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:36.100]   And there's no answer except their prejudice which makes them make a dogmatic pronouncement
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.420]   which can't be proved.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.780]   It still works in the same way.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:49.980]   Matthew Arnold, a great literature and a great poet, did exactly the same thing about
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   a hundred years ago.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.020]   He put it like this.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:40:00.220]   He said, "Miracles cannot happen, therefore miracles haven't happened."
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.500]   We must be foolish to waste so much time, my friends, if it's as simple as that.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.500]   There's no more to be said.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:12.020]   Miracles cannot happen.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.860]   So the New Testament documents are not reliable because they report miracles.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.660]   Because if a miracle cannot happen, a miracle hasn't happened, and they say miracles have
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.340]   happened, therefore they're wrong.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.100]   But you see what it's all based on?
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.100]   The dogmatism.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.820]   The statement that miracles cannot happen.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.060]   And how does he know that miracles cannot happen?
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.060]   He doesn't know that.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.540]   He simply says it, and because he says it, he goes on saying it.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:42.980]   And he's therefore quite unreasonable, irrationally logical.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.820]   And men and women are denying the miracles and the resurrection and prophecy in exactly
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.820]   the same way today.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.820]   It isn't intellect.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.860]   It's a dogmatism that is irrational.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:41:00.820]   But lastly I must come to this because it's the most important thing of all.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.740]   There is something even worse than all I've been saying, and it's this.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:15.820]   This state of unbelief produces an actual active resistance to the truth within us.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.940]   You remember what the Lord said unto this man Paul when he met him there on the road
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.820]   to Damascus?
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:29.620]   He spoke to him and said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.980]   And then Paul asked him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:40.140]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.580]   It's hard for thee to kick against the goads that are sticking into you, and you keep on
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.420]   kicking against them, and there they're piercing you.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.420]   It's hard for you.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   Aren't you tired of it, Paul?
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.260]   What's the matter with you?
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.260]   What's it mean?
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.820]   Well, it means just this, you see.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:02.380]   The apostle had gone on struggling against something that was happening within him.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.180]   Or there's no question at all about it.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.580]   He'd never been happy since the day that he saw the death of Stephen.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   He saw that man's face.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.580]   He'd heard his prayer.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.580]   He saw him.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.860]   He knew there was something there that he couldn't explain and he couldn't answer,
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.860]   and yet he fought against it.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.860]   He wouldn't give in to it.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.860]   He kicked against it, and he went on.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.860]   He's struggling.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.860]   There's an agony.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.860]   He's resisting with all his might and man.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.860]   It is hard for him.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.940]   He's resisting with all his might and man.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.980]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:36.020]   Why did he go on doing that?
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.080]   Why do you go on doing that if you're not a Christian?
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.580]   Because you're doing it.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:46.940]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.780]   There is nothing the natural man dislikes so much as to have to admit and to confess
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:56.180]   that he is wrong.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.420]   That's a part of our pride, isn't it, and our conceit.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.420]   I wrong?
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.900]   The thing I've always stood for proved to be wrong?
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.220]   Why, I couldn't look myself in the mirror if that is so.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.220]   I've always said it.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.420]   Am I now to get up and say I've been a fool?
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.940]   I was all wrong?
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.100]   It's the most difficult thing we are ever called upon to do, just to admit that we've
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.740]   been wrong.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:29.340]   We'll do anything rather than admit that we're wrong or apologize.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:34.140]   We'll do anything to people rather than just go to them and say, "I'm sorry.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.780]   I was wrong and I wronged you."
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.460]   We'll heap gifts and presents upon them.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.940]   We'll do anything, help them, anything but that.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.700]   Ah, you see, it means that we've got to admit we're wrong at the center.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.940]   So we hold on to our positions.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.260]   We rarely cease to believe in it, but we can't give up.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.260]   We can't go back.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.260]   We'll be exposing ourselves.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:58.660]   Self comes in and we hate it.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:07.160]   For the same reason, of course, we dislike being convicted in our personal lives.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.060]   We sometimes even like Bible readings and Bible studies, don't we, as long as they
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.140]   don't convict us.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.740]   It's the application of the truth we don't like.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:23.340]   It's a marvelous thing to have a great display of the Scripture and have it opened up.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:28.500]   You can sit back with folded arms and say, "Wonderful, very interesting, most enjoyable."
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.020]   But when it comes home to you and makes you see yourself and makes you wriggle in your
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.260]   feet, you don't like it.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:40.820]   And when it unmasks the running sore of your soul to you, you hate it.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.580]   And I am exactly the same.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:47.900]   I am speaking my own experience.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.460]   Then there's another way in which it works, and it's this.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:59.860]   There is this fundamental dislike in men to having to yield up himself.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.900]   He doesn't want to lose control of his own life.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.420]   He'll do this, he'll do that.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.100]   Yes, but what Christ wants is you, yourself.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.820]   You remember the story of the rich young ruler?
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.140]   He's done this, that, and the other.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.500]   "All right," said Christ, "now let me test you."
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:19.500]   "Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and come, follow me.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.500]   Surrender your will to me.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.500]   Let me lead you.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   Let me decide for you."
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.500]   He went away sorrowful.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   He'd do this, that, everything, but the surrender of self is the last citadel.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.780]   My self, my personality, how can I yield this?
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.220]   I hold on to it, though I see the facts, though I am convinced by them.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.220]   I won't give in to them.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.220]   I'll kick against the goads.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.940]   I'll fight.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.940]   I won't give in.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.460]   I'm surrendering the most precious thing of all.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.460]   I'm going to become a fool.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.540]   I've got to become as a little child.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.540]   I can't do it.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:57.060]   It's insulting to my ego, to my self-respect.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.860]   And then another thing, of course, is the love of sin.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:08.100]   "All right," says the man, "I see that argument for Christ and for Christianity,
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:15.380]   and I know it's true, but he does like this other thing, or it pleases him.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:19.660]   It gives him greater pleasure, what he says, a greater kick out of life than anything else,
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.140]   and he doesn't want to give it up.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.540]   He knows this is right, but he wants that also.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:28.140]   So he holds on, and he tries to put up the arguments, and he devours the literature to
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:33.060]   find an argument against Christ or something that will explain away this sin and determinant
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.860]   and allow him to go on as a respectable religious man so that he can go on holding to that other
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   thing.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.700]   Oh, I could keep you for hours.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.700]   I mustn't.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.020]   Fear of consequences comes in.
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:47.340]   What will it cost me?
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.100]   What will other people say about me?
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.380]   What will my family think?
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.300]   What will my companions think?
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.860]   What will they think in the office?"
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.980]   And so on, but let me hurry on to the vital thing.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.540]   Deep down you see it's nothing but an ultimate enmity against God.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.540]   It's self-assertion.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.940]   It's man pitting himself against the eternal and the absolute.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:14.780]   Yes, it's a hatred of God finally and a hatred of God's law, and it's all because he is controlled
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.780]   by the devil.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.780]   He's under the dominion of Satan.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.580]   Paul put it in his sermon afterwards, you remember.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.020]   Christ told him that he was to go to preach, to open their eyes, and to turn them from
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.340]   darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.660]   It's Satan who blinds.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.940]   He holds us there, and he puts these motives and ideas and suggestions, and he's controlling
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:45.260]   the intellectual world today as well as the moral world amongst men.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.500]   That's the position.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.660]   Unbelief is not a matter of intellect.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.780]   It's a matter of condition.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.940]   It's a matter of status.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.100]   It means, my friend, that you're in the grip of the devil, and that you're not allowed
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:06.420]   to see things as they are.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:13.160]   What man needs is not more intellect.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:20.220]   What man needs is not more light, more knowledge, more instruction.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.740]   I'll tell you what he needs.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:28.180]   He's put in a verse, the 19th verse of the third chapter of the Gospel according to St.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.140]   John, and this is how he puts it.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:44.780]   This is the condemnation, that light is come, has come, into the world.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:54.900]   But men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   They hate the light.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.900]   Why?
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.380]   Well, that which maketh manifest is light.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.980]   Light exposes, shows us up, as I've been telling you, and we don't like it.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.780]   We say we need more light, more knowledge, more instruction.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.980]   You don't, says the Gospel.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:19.540]   The light has come fully and in full meridian in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.500]   Your intellect is all right.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.780]   The light has come to it.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:36.220]   What you need, all you need is this, a heart, a condition that will love the light and hate
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.900]   the darkness.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:46.780]   Instead of the heart that you have now that loves the darkness and hates the light because
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.540]   your deeds are evil.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.260]   Beloved friend, have you realized that that's your condition?
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.820]   If you're not a Christian, there you are.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.820]   That's your position.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:00.500]   Alienated from God, held in the grip of the devil, do what you like.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:06.580]   You'll never set yourself free.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:13.500]   But the Son of God came from heaven in order to set you free.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.060]   He abased, he humbled himself.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.060]   He even died on the cross.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:27.780]   That you might be forgiven for your enmity against God and forgiven and reconciled to
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:33.140]   God but still more wonderful in a sense that you might be liberated from the bondage and
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:42.780]   the shackles of Satan and of sin and might be translated into the kingdom of light, the
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.700]   kingdom of God.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:49.220]   Are you content to stay in unbelief?
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:55.620]   Are you content to remain there, irrational, prejudiced, dogmatic, in ignorance?
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.900]   See the consequences, see the foulness of it all.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:05.060]   Cry out, I say, ask him from your heart to set you free.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:13.900]   And he'll not only hear you, he'll answer you, he'll deliver you, he will save you and
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:19.940]   turn you from being a child of darkness to a child of light.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:20.940]   Amen.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:25.500]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
