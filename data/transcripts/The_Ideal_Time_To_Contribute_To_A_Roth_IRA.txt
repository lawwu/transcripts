[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about the
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   Roth IRA.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.360]   So I was actually talking to my editor at Penguin Random House about the Roth IRA and
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.040]   the traditional IRA chapter and it made me realize how I missed the boat on contributing
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.280]   to a Roth IRA and it just reminded me of how I was so myopic in my thinking because when
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.960]   I first started Financial Samurai it was back in 2009 and I was making a good income and
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.680]   because I was making a good income I couldn't contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.680]   For 2021 as a single person you must make under $140,000 to contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.440]   and if you're married and filed jointly your modified adjusted gross income must be under
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.380]   $208,000 to contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.680]   So fortunately or unfortunately I wasn't able to contribute to a Roth IRA because my income
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880]   back then was higher than the limits and the limits back then were lower.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   So I thought to myself well screw the Roth IRA.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.880]   I found it to be discriminatory.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.080]   Why was there this arbitrary income figure that enabled people to contribute whereas
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.600]   some people could not?
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.520]   And I even wrote a post called the disadvantages of the Roth IRA which I'll link to in the
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.880]   show notes and it just goes through point after point on why you shouldn't contribute
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.560]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.120]   But again I had a very myopic way of thinking about it because I couldn't contribute.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.060]   So if I couldn't contribute well why are other people contributing?
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.080]   But over time over time I recognized the fallacy in my ways.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.360]   I also read through 600 plus comments arguing for and against contributing to a Roth IRA
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   and I've come around.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360]   I really have.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.560]   And if you look through the progress over the years I wrote a post called why I never
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280]   contributed to a Roth IRA but why you probably should.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.720]   And as a father of two children now I think opening up a custodial Roth IRA is a no brainer.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.120]   It is such a no brainer.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.800]   I'm recording this podcast to tell you that it is a no brainer.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.760]   In the most simple example think about it this way.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   If you are a student you can earn twelve thousand five hundred fifty dollars tax free.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   Then you can contribute that tax free money up to six thousand dollars in your Roth IRA
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.960]   and then it can compound over the years over the decades without a tax drag.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.500]   And then when you withdraw that money it's tax free.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.680]   So to not contribute to a Roth IRA when you're earning income below the standard deduction
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.320]   amount is foolish.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.800]   And if you are earning a salary that doesn't face a high tax rate you should probably contribute
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.440]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000]   For most of us as we gain more experience and expertise we're going to make more money.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.940]   So that's really logical and therefore we're going to face a higher tax rate.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.240]   So contribute to a Roth IRA when you're young when you're inexperienced when you don't make
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.720]   much money.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.600]   Let's go through what the current marginal tax rates are the federal marginal tax rates.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.160]   So 10 percent up to nine thousand nine hundred fifty dollars.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.200]   Twelve percent from nine thousand nine hundred fifty one to forty thousand five hundred twenty
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.640]   five.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.160]   Twenty two percent from forty thousand five hundred twenty six to eighty six thousand
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   three hundred seventy five.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   Twenty four percent from eighty six thousand three hundred seventy six to one hundred sixty
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   four thousand nine hundred twenty five.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.380]   And after that it's the 32 percent bracket 35 percent and 37 percent tax bracket.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.360]   So where is the biggest jump.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.520]   The biggest jump is from 12 percent to 22 percent marginal income tax rate.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.640]   So when you start making above forty thousand five hundred twenty five up to eighty six
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.260]   thousand three hundred seventy five.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.740]   That is the biggest jump.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.400]   The second biggest jump is from 24 percent to 32 percent.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.080]   That's an 8 percent jump.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.640]   So once you start making over one hundred sixty five thousand basically up to two hundred
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.960]   nine thousand four hundred twenty five.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.360]   You're at 32 percent.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.920]   So the question you have to ask yourself is how much of a tax rate you're comfortable
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.240]   paying up front to the inefficient government so you can earn money tax free.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.500]   And what do you think your tax rate will be in retirement.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.720]   Well here is some shocking news that I think some people don't believe.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.840]   And that is you're probably going to make less money in retirement than while you are
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   working.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.120]   So if you think about that logic that in retirement your income and your marginal tax rate should
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.560]   be lower than while you were working at least during your middle and high income earning
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560]   years.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.500]   That's really logical but a lot of people don't see it that way.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.000]   A lot of people believe that they will be making even more in retirement than while
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   working.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Now they've got that mixed up.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.120]   I think what they think they mean is they will have more net worth in retirement than
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.320]   while they were working.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   That's logical.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.880]   But from the income standpoint it's illogical.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.680]   Therefore you need to think about tax differentials while you're working and while you're retired.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.840]   And because interest rates have come down basically for the past 40 years it's going
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.600]   to take a lot more capital to generate more risk adjusted income.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.760]   It just simply does.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.980]   It takes double the amount of capital to generate the same amount of income from going from
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.940]   4% to 2%.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.160]   So now that you have this logical framework in mind let's just go back to the federal
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.080]   marginal income tax rates.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.520]   I don't think anybody should spend or pay more than 24% in federal marginal income tax.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.960]   Therefore once you make over $165,000 I don't know folks I don't think contributing to a
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.000]   Roth IRA is a good idea.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.520]   Are you really going to feel good paying a 32% marginal income tax rate for your $6,000
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   contribution to your Roth IRA?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.800]   I wouldn't because 32% is just federal.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   If you have state it could be another 4% to 7% and that just doesn't feel good to me.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.640]   Okay so forget about feeling good and feeling bad.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.280]   Let's just run the numbers.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.300]   At 32% the marginal tax rate you got to make over about $165,000 up to $209,000.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.900]   How much capital is required to generate that type of income in retirement?
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.460]   Let's just use $200,000 and divide it by 4%.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.500]   You need $5 million in capital to generate $200,000.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.680]   But how many Americans have $5 million in capital in retirement?
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.080]   The answer is less than 5% because the top 1% threshold is about $10 million.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.360]   Now let's take a more conservative divisor since interest rates have come down and divide
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.420]   $200,000 by 2%.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.960]   Well now you need $10 million in capital to generate $200,000 a year in retirement.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.240]   So the reality is I think some people just are not doing the math.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.980]   You got to do the math and be realistic with your future net worth assumptions and income
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.980]   assumptions.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.480]   Of course we're going to have social security.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.040]   The average social security amount is about $15,000 to $16,000 a year.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.600]   And then you would add your investment income in retirement to come up with your estimated
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.720]   retirement income and marginal tax rate.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.340]   And you know what's funny folks?
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.640]   This exercise on contributing above $165,000 is mute because the government saves us a
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   little bit.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.440]   It saves us by saying only people who make less than $140,000 a year can contribute to
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.940]   the Roth IRA.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.720]   So only people in the 24% marginal tax bracket can contribute.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.420]   So when you think about it that way, then it's all about looking at the remaining tax
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.580]   rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, and 24%.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:03.040]   So I would take it a step further and say, well, once you start making $86,376 a year
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.480]   or more, that puts you in the 24% tax rate, I don't know if I'd be contributing to a Roth
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   IRA.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:16.840]   I would just contribute to a Roth IRA if I'm in the 22% or lower marginal income tax rate.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.960]   A 22% marginal income tax rate seems quite reasonable.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.200]   All in, you're going to have an effective tax rate of probably in the teens with your
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.900]   federal income tax.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.080]   So that's reasonable.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.400]   You're keeping four times the amount of money than the government is taking from you.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.080]   It seems pretty fair.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:43.360]   Therefore, max out your Roth IRA if you can at those income levels to diversify your retirement
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.640]   income streams.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.160]   So one thing my father who's in his 70s told me was that I wish I contributed more to a
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.180]   Roth IRA because he's got social security, he's got a pension, and he's got to pay taxes
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.960]   on those required minimum distributions after age 70, and he's over age 70.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:06.840]   If he had invested in a Roth IRA, even if it's just $6,000 a year contribution for 10,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.920]   20 years, I'm not quite sure exactly what his income was, it would be a really nice
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.640]   sum of money that he doesn't have to pay tax on.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.360]   So it is about diversification of your retirement income sources.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.300]   Now obviously, the next part of the equation is the future of marginal income tax rates.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.240]   What will they be when we are retired?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.120]   The fact of the matter is nobody knows, but we can look at the trend.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.240]   The trend is down.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.920]   Marginal income tax rates in America have come down from the 70s, 80s, 90s, and it's
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   been great.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.440]   It's been a boon for capitalists.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.120]   And given it's been a boom, and given we are all more accustomed to lower marginal income
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.840]   tax rates, it's really hard to see marginal income tax rates go up a lot for at least
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.120]   the middle class.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:04.680]   Sure, the top marginal income tax rate is trying to be increased to 39.7% under President
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.000]   Biden.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Will it happen?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.680]   I'm not sure, but even if it does happen, well, less than 5% of the American population
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   will be affected, so it doesn't really matter.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.780]   And then if we're talking about the Roth IRA perspective, it's a middle class retirement
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.860]   savings vehicle that has an income limit of $140,000 this year, so it really doesn't matter.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.620]   In conclusion, I say contribute to your Roth IRA to the maximum if you can, so long as
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.660]   your income is in the 22% marginal federal income tax bracket or lower.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.120]   Now in the future, income tax rates might change, and whatever changes that may happen,
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.040]   I say continue to contribute to your Roth IRA so long as your marginal income tax bracket
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.120]   is about 25% lower.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.100]   Over 25%, I think it's a gray area, and it's kind of a wash.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.880]   Your goal is to contribute as much to your retirement accounts as possible in a tax advantageous
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   manner.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.240]   The Roth IRA is one, the traditional IRA is another, but for pre-tax dollars, I would
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.800]   try to focus on maxing out your 401(k) every single year.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.060]   Do it, make it automatic, and your spending and your budget will adjust accordingly.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:23.220]   I also want you guys to think about the Roth IRA and the 401(k) as kind of funny money.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.940]   It's kind of like Social Security.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:31.740]   If it's there for you after the age of 60, then great, but try not to count on it to
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.400]   live your ideal retirement lifestyle.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.060]   You've got Social Security, but more importantly, over the 40 years that you're going to be
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.900]   working after high school, you're building your taxable portfolio.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.380]   Your taxable portfolio is your brokerage accounts.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.100]   It can also be your rental property portfolio and other investments, as well as your side
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.740]   hustle and your business.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.420]   These are the investments and assets that are going to generate passive income so you
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.900]   can reach financial freedom sooner than the traditional 60 plus retirement age.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.560]   And if you're happy working until 60 plus, then great, you found that job that provides
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.260]   you meaning, that provides you some purpose, and that's wonderful.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.160]   However, it's always good to think about your retirement income as a diverse portfolio due
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.380]   to tax liability.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.340]   Taxes are our largest ongoing liability.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.700]   There's no way around it, but we can be smart about things and we can diversify.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.260]   So if you have any thoughts about the Roth IRA, I'd love to hear it.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.980]   I've definitely changed my tune over the years, especially now that I'm a father.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.300]   And that's one of the most important things in personal finance, being flexible in thought,
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.260]   being open to new ideas and new perspectives, and to just try to keep an open mind when
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.340]   you hear something that might not sound quite right.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.200]   But the reality is it could be right for that person.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.400]   So thanks so much and if you enjoyed this episode, I'd love a positive review.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.020]   Take care folks.
