[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   I want to talk today about morning routines.
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.360]   This is a tricky topic.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.440]   For critics of online productivity culture, overly complicated morning rituals that often
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.200]   seem to rely on confident citations of shaky science have come to represent a lot of what
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.720]   people dislike about online productivity spaces.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.080]   But as I'll explain as this deep dive unfolds, you know, I feel like my mornings recently
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.560]   have been getting off to a sort of a shaky start and I want to revamp what I'm doing.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.920]   So with some trepidation, I recently waded into the online productivity world to read
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.760]   articles, social media feeds, and YouTube channels about morning rituals.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.000]   What is this thing that's happening online?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.640]   What I've done is I've broken them down into three categories.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.280]   I'm going to go through these categories, tell you what I found, what's good about each
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.540]   of these categories, what's bad, what my takeaway lessons are, and then I'll end by saying what
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.440]   changes did I make in my own life based on all that I discovered.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.000]   All right, so let's get into it.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.560]   First of all, why do I need this?
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.640]   What I have been finding in my own morning, so my morning starts very predictably because
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.040]   I have three young kids.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.900]   They all take the same school bus.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.800]   We have to be out the door about 730 to make the walk to the bus stop.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.180]   The bus stop's about half to three quarters of a mile away.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.000]   So our morning is very much like get up, wrangle, wrangle, wrangle out the door, get the kids
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   to the bus, walk back.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.280]   Now by the time we're back, it's 810, maybe 815.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.400]   This is where I'm shaky.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.800]   I just eat up too much time between finishing the morning family ritual, getting the kids
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.560]   out the door, and getting a tightly time block planned day unfolding.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.400]   Just to get ready often takes me way too much time.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   I don't know why.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   I've talked about this before on the show.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.680]   It's just some weird block I have.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.120]   But just to go get showered and dressed, like if I have to go to campus or come to the podcast
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.960]   studio, it just takes way too much time.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.880]   I often find myself before my schedule really gets going, I might actually get sucked into
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.280]   some sort of administrative chore or task that is in list.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.400]   What ends up happening is by the time my day gets going, I'm cursing how much time has
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   already passed.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.440]   When I look at face the productivity dragon and time block my day to follow, it's like,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.060]   "Well, there's not enough time in here to do the things I really want to do.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.400]   I'm almost to my first appointment of the day."
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.640]   I want to tighten that up.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.600]   This is where I was hoping by looking at popular morning routines online, I would find some
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   ideas.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   As I mentioned, I've roughly categorized this content that's out there right now in popular
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   into three categories.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.460]   The first category, type one of the morning routine rituals, I'm going to call this the
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.960]   embrace the suck videos.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.160]   Embrace the suck being a term out of the special forces that basically says when going gets
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.680]   hard, the idea with that term is lean into the hardness.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   That's great.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   Hardness is good.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.160]   There's a certain type of person talking online that really pushes this for their morning
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160]   routine.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.640]   The whole point should be do something really hard.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.720]   Here's a classic example of that.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.920]   This is probably the originator of the embrace the suck morning routine.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   It's Jocko Willink.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.840]   If you're watching, instead of just listening, I've loaded up Jocko's Twitter feed here on
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.320]   the screen.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.640]   His Twitter feed, he's been doing this for, God, I think he started doing this in 2015,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.600]   but famously like most of what he does on here, and I have it on the screen, is every
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.200]   morning he takes a picture of his watch when he wakes up.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Here's a picture from four hours ago, and it says it's 428 in the morning.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   What's his caption?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.000]   You know what you have to do, in caps, do it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.240]   Here's the day before, 433, caption, stay in the fight.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.720]   Then he will accompany it with a video, a picture straightly later of where he exercised.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.040]   He does brutal exercising.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.600]   He's a sort of a monster of a man, so 428 picture of the watch right now, and then a
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.440]   picture of a Bulgarian bag, which is like a, was that just like a weighted bag you carry
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   or something like that?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   Probably.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   Yeah, something terrible, and it says aftermath, move, right?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.600]   That's like the originator of the embrace, to get up really early and do something really
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.160]   hard.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.040]   This has evolved, so if we look at online circles and we look at examples of the embrace
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.800]   to suck morning routine, a new aspect that's emerged in sort of like the post Jocko world
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.720]   is the cold plunge.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.400]   So here I have a clip that Jesse will play from TikTok of Joe Rogan, who helped popularize
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.280]   this, talking about his morning routine.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.960]   See if we can play this here.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.280]   Morning, I don't dress warm, I wear my underwear, and I go outside, and it's 40 degrees this
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.560]   morning, and I walk out, and I lift the lid on that Marasco cold plunge, and I see the
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.000]   ice floating up in there, and every day I climb in, and I just get in there for three
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.400]   minutes in the morning, and then I work out.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.040]   So that's how I start my day now.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.200]   All right, so that has also become popular.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.040]   So I often feel like Rogan, because he's in comedy, so he's out late, is not going to
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.440]   wake up at 4.30 in the morning, so his equivalent of something that is over the top hard to
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   get the day started is let's go into an ice-encrusted outside cold plunge for three minutes.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   There's a lot of people who talk about doing this in the morning as well.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400]   So this is all the same type of morning routine, do something super hard first thing in the
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   morning.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.920]   All right, so let's do the bad and the good.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.440]   The bad, one of the places we see a bit of a problem is when people try to justify some
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.000]   of this behavior through ill-sighted science.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.180]   So for example, I'm not an exercise medicine person, but my friends who are, I'm thinking
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.400]   in particular like my friend Brad Stolberg will tell me that there's a lot of people
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.780]   citing science about cold plunges that try to justify that there's this really large
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.960]   therapeutic benefit.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.520]   And he's read all of these studies, and he says these effect sizes are teeny.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.600]   It's like the same effect size you get from having a cup of coffee in terms of improvement
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.240]   to well-being in the moment or like seeing something funny, like there are these minor
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.400]   like therapeutically irrelevant impacts.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.680]   It's easy to oversell, you know, like hey, your body is, you're going to live for 20
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   more years.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   It's easy to do that.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.800]   I don't think the big players do, but a lot of the secondary people do.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.000]   The other bad I'd say with this is that not all of these activities are sustainable for
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   all people.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.920]   In particular, we know there's a small percent of the population.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.960]   I don't know what the percent is.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.760]   I think it's 10% or less who just don't need as much sleep.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.520]   We don't know why, but it's like there's a small group of people that like fine with
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.400]   four hours of sleep.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   Jocko Willink is one of those people, and he talks about this, like he will actually
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.800]   talk about it if you listen to him, is that like he doesn't recommend that his kids wake
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.320]   up at 430 because they need more sleep than he does.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.000]   You know, he's self-selected as someone who doesn't need a lot of sleep, made it easy
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.520]   for him to go through, easier for him to go through Navy SEAL training, et cetera, like
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.560]   it kind of makes sense that he had this successful Special Forces career.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.920]   But that's not necessarily a sustainable model for everyone.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.680]   Both him and Joe Rogan do really intense like exercises in the morning as well.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.420]   And like those routines are routines, you know, for someone, they've been doing this
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420]   for decades.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.120]   And so their body and they have trainers and they've been building up this sort of base
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   or whatever.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.520]   So, you know, it's not all translatable.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.120]   But what's the good in the Embrace the Suck morning routines?
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.160]   I mean, I think the main advantage that we get with someone like Jocko or Joe in their
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.260]   row in their rituals is psychology, psychological.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.500]   By doing something really hard, you are signaling to yourself that you're the type of person
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.040]   who does really hard things.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.600]   I'm elite in this way.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.360]   Most people avoid discomfort.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.860]   I'm bringing in crazy discomfort.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.040]   I'm waking up at 430.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.800]   I'm getting into an ice encrusted bath.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.880]   I don't know if there's like a physical therapeutic benefit.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.200]   But what I'm telling myself is, you are someone who does hard things.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.280]   We've talked about this on the show before, that discipline is largely an identity and
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.480]   not a trait that you have or don't have.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.660]   So it's a good way to build is what I think they're doing here is maintaining a narrative
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:40.680]   of a self-narrative of exceptionality, which then fuels the other things you want to do
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.840]   during the day.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.640]   You just you just have that more belief in yourself.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.480]   All right, so the lesson I'm drawing from this first category of popular morning rituals
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.920]   online is that finding ways to signal to yourself that you're disciplined is probably a good
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   thing.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.760]   It doesn't, however, have to be in the guise of extreme physical acts.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.520]   In fact, it probably doesn't have to be physical at all.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.600]   I can imagine other ways that people could signal to themselves that they do extreme
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.200]   things and they're disciplined and maybe have nothing to do with physicality at all.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.720]   It's an extreme intellectual endeavor, for example, or a religious endeavor, et cetera.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.240]   So I think that the general lesson here is there is power in reminding yourself you're
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.000]   able to do optional hard things, even if the thing is arbitrary, because that will put
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.920]   you in the right mindset to do non-arbitrary things that are also hard, but not urgent
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   as the day goes on.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.820]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:41.280]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.700]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.080]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.880]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   Check it out.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.200]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.400]   All right.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.040]   The second category, broad category of these morning rituals I found online, I didn't really
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   know what to call this category, self-discovery or recentering your soul.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.680]   I'm not quite sure what the right way to describe this category, but the canonical example of
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:19.840]   this category is Hal Elrod's 2012 bestselling book, The Miracle Morning.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   This was very influential in how people were thinking about morning routines, especially
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.800]   in this early social media period, 2012 to 2016 or so, and we see a lot of variations
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.000]   of what Hal suggests in that book online, especially in social media spaces.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.720]   I'm going to pull up an article here from 2019 where a reporter, I think this is from
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:49.880]   NBC News, tried the Miracle Morning and kind of talks it for a month and talks about how
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.760]   it went, but it gives us a good summary of what actually this ritual means.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.720]   The article I'm pulling here is titled, I Tried the Miracle Morning Productivity Routine
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   for a Month.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   Here is what happened.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.960]   This is by Locke Hughes from 2019.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.080]   So what I'm going to do here is just scroll down.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.880]   What I like about this article is the reporter summarizes the six practices of Hal Elrod's
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.320]   Miracle Morning.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.560]   So Elrod abbreviates the six practices as S-A-V-E-R-S, acronym SAVERS.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.340]   So the S stands for silence.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.560]   When you wake up, the first thing you do is you sit silently.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.160]   This could be, for example, doing a mindfulness meditation.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.760]   The reporter used Calm meditation app to sort of run through a morning meditation.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   All right.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.520]   The second piece of the Miracle Morning is A for affirmations.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.220]   An affirmation is a sentence or two in alignment with what you want to accomplish and who you
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.400]   need to be to accomplishing it.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:56.200]   Elrod suggests your affirmation should make an impression on your subconscious mind, transform
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   how you think and feel so you can overcome your limiting beliefs.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.120]   The reporter in this article's affirmation was, "I'm an accomplished, successful writer,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.680]   author, and speaker.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.140]   My work helps others feel less alone and empowers them to make the choices and decisions that
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.320]   lead them to their best life."
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.420]   You say that to yourself a bunch of times.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.600]   Then in your Miracle Morning, you go to V for visualization.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.680]   You train your brain to see things as you would like them to be instead of as they are.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.440]   Elrod's suggesting this for five minutes.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.200]   Visualize living your ideal day, performing all tasks with ease, confidence, and enjoyment.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.120]   Then comes E for exercise.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.420]   Again, you're still in your morning ritual here.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.840]   You don't need to run eight miles or even go to the gym unless you want to, but exercise
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.920]   can be something as simple as a 10-minute yoga routine or set of bodyweight exercise
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   you do in the living room floor.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.500]   You just need to get moving and the blood and oxygen flowing to the brain.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.460]   Then comes R for reading.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.340]   Just practice fast checks, transformation at any part of your life.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.340]   Elrod explained, "Don't reinvent the wheel."
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.300]   He reminds us, "The fastest way to achieve everything you want is to model successful
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.340]   people who have already achieved it.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.580]   Read 10 pages per day."
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.380]   Finally, the final S is for scribing.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.760]   Scribing just means writing, but a W would have ruined the acronym.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.860]   This means journaling, jotting down ideas, making a gratitude list, putting whatever
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.860]   is on your mind on paper.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.940]   That was the Miracle Morning.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.100]   I see a lot of variations of this when I'm looking at morning routine content where people
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:32.500]   have a relatively, I would characterize it as a relatively long list of morning checklist
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   activities.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   There's usually journaling involved.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.180]   There's usually some sort of meditation involved, some sort of light exercise.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.900]   All these things you do, they're sort of self-centered on yourself, yourself, your understanding
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.620]   of yourself, preparing for your day, rediscovering yourself.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.380]   Any variation like that, I put that into that same category.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:59.580]   All right, so let's go for the bad and the good of this sort of re-centering, morning
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.940]   re-centering approach.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.780]   The bad is, well, first of all, it can be a lot of time each morning.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.260]   You're sort of navel gazing.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.340]   You're thinking about yourself, but none of this is actually making traction.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.180]   It's not making traction on something that, I don't want to use the word productive here,
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.780]   but something that has an output that you need.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:28.180]   Even an exercise routine, that exercise is part of what I need to do for my body or work
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.540]   or whatever it is.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.540]   There's kind of that sense of frustration of I'm doing semi-arbitrary seeming activities
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.540]   and it takes a while.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.720]   You're going through this checklist.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.580]   What happens is I think a lot of people get impatient and you're like, "Ugh," kind of
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.260]   fake meditating visual.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.340]   It becomes a rote, right?
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.340]   I'm scribing thoughts.
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.540]   I'm just going to jot something down.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.780]   I'm visualizing my day like, "Come on, let's just roll past this."
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.500]   I also think it's very personality-driven, right?
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.460]   If you told Jocko Willink, "All right, here's your six-step thing you have to do in the
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.900]   morning and you're going to have to sit there quietly and then visualize your day being
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.580]   successful and then say positive affirmations about yourself," he's going to throw a kettle
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.440]   ball through the wall, right?
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   It's just not his personality.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.420]   He's like, "I would rather do squats with a Bulgarian bag," whatever that is.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.180]   It's also very personality-driven.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.020]   The good about this approach, because again, I think in each of these approaches there's
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.020]   a hidden value.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.260]   It might not be explicitly what they talk about, but it helps explain their popularity.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.020]   Here I think the good is our brain can be ungrounded in the morning.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.940]   By our brain, I mean in particular our conscious thoughts.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.420]   They can go everywhere, stressful, distracting, diverting.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.940]   They can bring us into weird rabbit holes.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.860]   If you pull out a phone early in the morning, your brain and your thoughts can really get
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.420]   captured in weird places that it takes a long time to escape from.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.260]   It gets harder and harder to ground it in something useful.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.340]   Having this immediate series of cognitive internal things you do grounds your brain
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.340]   in the morning.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.480]   It prevents you from the alternative of an ungrounded brain just rattling off into whatever
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.300]   thought, stressful or otherwise.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.660]   I really think probably 80% of the value this approach generates for people right now is
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.540]   it prevents them from looking at their phone first thing.
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.580]   And any alternative to looking at your phone first thing is probably positive regardless
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.580]   of the details.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:23.940]   Again, it could be just reorganizing your Jocko-approved Bulgarian bags in order.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:30.300]   If you just have something to do that's not your phone, I think that is positive.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.900]   That's the lesson I'm pulling from that second category is that having some sort of cognitive
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.940]   plan in the morning matters.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:44.300]   Something where it directs what you're thinking about early in your day so you don't start
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.580]   your day with your thoughts being ungrounded.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.340]   There's probably real benefit in that.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:59.460]   The third category of morning routines I call the MIT abbreviation for most important thing
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.260]   style morning rituals.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.420]   I think Andrew Huberman's rituals is a good example.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.740]   He has some other stuff in it, but let's start there.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.700]   My example here is I have a clip from the goal guys where one of the goal guys says,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.140]   "I'm going to try Andrew Huberman's routine and see what happens," but I think it's a
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.540]   good way of summarizing Huberman's routine.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.940]   So here I'm going to play this on the screen for those who are watching.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.980]   What is Andrew Huberman's morning routine?
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:33.580]   For me, I tend to wake up sometime around 6am, 6.30, and I write down the time in which
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.580]   I woke up.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:40.020]   The second thing I do after I wake up is I make a beeline for sunlight, so getting outside
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:46.420]   for a 10-minute walk or a 15-minute walk is absolutely vital to mental and physical health.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.420]   We get back, I start craving caffeine, but I purposely delay my caffeine intake to 90
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.060]   minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.020]   So for me, I just drink water.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.700]   I also put a little bit of sea salt in the water.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.580]   And I also drink my athletic greens, which is compatible with fasting.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.020]   So I don't eat anything until about 11am or 12 noon.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.900]   Next I would do a 90-minute bout of work, and that's typically phone off and out of
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.900]   the room.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:21.260]   You'd be amazed how much you can get done in 90 minutes if you are focused.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.740]   After I finish that cognitive work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740]   an hour.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.740]   Very last, but certainly...
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:34.940]   So now we're kind of in mid-morning now, so it's no longer talking about his morning routine.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.780]   I was actually surprised looking up Huberman's routine, because the sense I had gotten about
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:47.840]   the way people talk about Huberman's protocols is that they are always overly complicated
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.100]   and super scientific, right?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.700]   I actually was surprised.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.520]   To me, you could simplify this routine.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.280]   Basically there's two pieces to it.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.940]   Piece one, wake up, get outside right away, and then do work, something important right
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940]   away.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.140]   That's where the MIT or most important thing of the day acronym comes from.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.420]   And then step two, there's a nutritional piece on it, but the nutritional piece is really
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:19.700]   he fast until lunch, which is not a crazy nutritional strategy.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.180]   Peter Atiyah talks about this in his book.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.580]   He's like, "Look, if you need to...
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.160]   There's different ways to control the calories you consume to prevent overnutrition.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.380]   One of the easy ways to do it is restrict the time in which you eat."
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.420]   So from just a practical manner, getting going and waiting until lunch to have your first
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.820]   food of the day is a reasonable strategy for keeping the total calories in the day more
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.820]   reasonable.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.580]   So that's not that crazy of a thing.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:52.660]   The part that is crazy, and I think this completely exposes Andrew Huberman as the most dangerous,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.220]   worst type of charlatan, not drinking caffeine right away, I'm not on board with that.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.140]   Jesse, that's got to be wrong.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.740]   He's got to be wrong on that.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.660]   You got to get your coffee going right away.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.660]   Okay.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.700]   So I've seen variations of this sort of Huberman plan, some variations all over the place,
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.980]   the elements being you get going on something important right away without doing anything
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.980]   else professionally and with some combination of getting some sunlight or getting outside.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.180]   We'll call that the MIT strategy.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.400]   I mean, I've seen it different ways.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.420]   Some people use sunlamps and some people do work and then go outside and then do work,
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.220]   but just getting going with something hard before you engage with the world and getting
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.900]   outside.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.180]   And I guess from a nutrition standpoint, waiting until that first block of work is done before
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.260]   you even think about like food or breakfast or something like this.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.340]   Okay.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.860]   So what's the good and the bad with this morning routine strategy?
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.960]   On the bad side, mornings can be tricky schedule-wise if you have other people in your life.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.860]   So this adds some complexity to MIT strategies because, you know, hey, you have to get the
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.860]   kids up.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.180]   You got to get the kids to school.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.980]   And now if you really want to try to like get up, go outside and get something done
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.420]   before that, you're getting up so early that unless you have Jocko circadian rhythms, you're
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.420]   going to be super tired.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.940]   So it can get kind of complicated.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.100]   There's also a danger to the most important thing methodology in general.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.380]   It's a danger that I've talked often about like throughout sort of my history of dealing
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.640]   with these issues.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.660]   And that is it's easy to fall into the trap that like once you've worked on your quote
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.780]   unquote most important thing of the day that you then just fall into like reactive sludge
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.780]   for the rest of the day.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.460]   Hey, that's my scheduling for the day.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.180]   I worked for 90 minutes on X and now it's like whatever.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.180]   Inbox is open.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.180]   I'm kind of slacking.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.660]   I had this debate with Oliver Berkman when he was on the show last fall.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:52.500]   And where we landed is if you have a very autonomous relatively non-crowded job, so
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.060]   like a writer like Oliver, that's probably fine.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.700]   Like you get your pages in in the morning and then you kind of do your best with some
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.900]   like reactive stuff, answer some emails, have some calls, like you don't really have to
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.900]   be on point.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   You'll be fine.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.620]   But for a lot of knowledge work jobs because of pseudo productivity, because of the issues
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.460]   I talk about in my book Slow Productivity where we have too much on our plates and we
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.940]   have inefficient communication protocols, that's not going to work for most people.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.260]   If you just do one thing with focus and then just anything goes, list reactive method for
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.240]   the rest of the day, you're going to fall behind.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   You're going to be stressed.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   You're going to exhaust your brain.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   You'll probably end up worse.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.760]   So you don't want the most important thing of the day to be the only scheduling of the
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.960]   day.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.880]   You probably still, if you have a sort of standard overloaded knowledge work style job,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.800]   you still want to probably time block the rest of your day so that you're getting the
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.840]   most out of that without the work unduly taxing you or your brain or becoming unsustainable.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.820]   All right, so that would be the potential bad there.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:59.600]   The good, I think Huberman and everyone else is right on track based on my own experience.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.880]   Get outside right away matters.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.080]   I mean I do this because I walk my kids to the bus stop.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.360]   I've been doing this forever.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.720]   Even when my kids were young, we had a dog at the time.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:15.660]   I would take the dog out very early because my wife would go, she would go to work early.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.040]   We had a shifted thing.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.160]   She would go to work on the early side so that I could get the kids up and fed and wait
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.020]   till the nanny was there.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.640]   Then she would come home on the earlier side or leave the nanny and then I was going to
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.320]   work later and I would come back later.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.440]   I had to walk the dog before she left for work early so I got very used to like, "Oh,
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   you're out there."
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.360]   Actually, it's great just seasons.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   It's cold.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   It's hot.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   It's somewhere in between.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   The sun is starting to come up now.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   I don't know.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   It really does ground you.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   I do think that's really great.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.360]   Yes, I do this.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.440]   I fall out of it but I've always experienced getting right into something deep is like
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.340]   the best way to aggregate a lot of deep work.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.200]   That's just like a well-known heuristic from anyone who's had deep work being a regular
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.520]   part of their job responsibilities.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.840]   Being able to just get into something deep right away before anything else, you get the
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.600]   clearest focus on your brain.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   Why?
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.920]   Because when you open up the neurological black box there, what you see is a minimum
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.320]   of conflicting cognitive semantic networks activated.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.320]   If I haven't looked at any emails yet, if I haven't looked at any other projects, this
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.380]   is the first thing relevant to my job I'm doing.
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.600]   There is very little cognitive conflict.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:30.040]   You have these abstract reasoning centers of your brain can so much quicker and so much
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.840]   more totally turn their focus to the task at hand.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.520]   It's the purest deep work you can generate in the day is that first time of the day.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.240]   To me, some way of like get outside and get after it and then deal with the rest of your
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.040]   day that makes a lot of sense to my experience, the experience of people I talk to.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   All right.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.360]   So how did I draw lessons from this for my own life and for my own morning attention
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.160]   issues?
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.560]   When it comes to exactly what I'm doing in the morning, given my setup, the MIT Huberman
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.620]   style approach makes the most sense for me.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.800]   What does this really mean for me?
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.440]   It just means a recommitment to the simple rule of as I walk in the door, so I'm already
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.880]   getting the outside walking part because I'm going to the bus stop.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.600]   As I walk back in the door, it is right to a desk and into deep work.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   Just that simplicity of that rule is what I need.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.240]   A variation of that rule I've been considering, I think this might be even better for getting
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.320]   the effects of it, is what I really should do is on the way back, don't come back to
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:41.680]   my house, come back to the coffee shop Bevco, get my coffee from Bevco, walk down the block
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.360]   right up to the deep work HQ.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.140]   So now it's a completely different cognitive context.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.680]   I have an office two minutes from my house and next to a coffee shop.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   That's really what I should do.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.240]   That should be the routine.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   And I come in here and it's just right in the pre-stage.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   Here's what I'm doing.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.640]   I'm writing deep work, like whatever it is.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.220]   Then I start thinking about, just so I can walk you through like how I think about these
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.360]   type of weekly template type scheduling rules.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.680]   Now the issue is some days, I try to keep my first half of my days as empty as possible.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.600]   Some days, if it's like a non-teaching day, hopefully I've kept my morning clear till
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   at least noon.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.640]   In those days, I should just rock and roll for three hours plus during a semester.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.240]   In the summer, I could do this like every day.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.920]   On other days, if I have something scheduled in the morning, still do this even if it's
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   symbolic.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:39.800]   So let's say I have to get in for a 10 a.m. meeting or something like that.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.280]   Still do like 20 minutes or 30 minutes of deep work so that that connection is strong.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   That's what I'm thinking about.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.400]   I just do this every morning.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.840]   Bus stop to my office, sit down, do something deep, even if it's symbolically 20 minutes
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.040]   and then I have to go and get ready to go, just so that my mind says that's what I always
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.760]   do.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.840]   The goal should be on like every day possible, make that an hour to 90 minutes with the three
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.400]   to four hour blocks.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.760]   You really want those like at least for my case, at least twice a week.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.280]   So I'm just sort of walking you through and then what I would do after that is like as
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.280]   soon as that block is done, then I time block plan the rest of the day and then for me that's
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.880]   just like the juggling match with my normal, I got my five jobs, I want to finish my five
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.440]   and now I need to make the most of the time that follows to be very careful.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.200]   What about the other lessons though from watching the other morning routines content online?
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.120]   I actually think those lessons can be integrated and to some degree I already do integrate
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.280]   them into my life, just not in the morning.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:41.720]   So if we look at the embrace the suck type idea, that doesn't have to be first thing
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.080]   in the morning.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.800]   If my analysis is correct, that what matters there is the psychology of telling yourself
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.880]   on a regular basis and demonstrate yourself on a regular basis, I can do hard things.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.080]   It's not so critical that's first thing in the morning.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:02.680]   So for me, like I've typically exercise post work pre dinner.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.940]   That's a place to start the embrace the suck methodology would say, yeah, start making
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.520]   that more brutal or interesting or crazy.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.000]   You know, it doesn't have to be the morning, but you have one thing every day where you're
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.840]   doing something that's like really hard and optional, right?
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.720]   So that lesson would say upgrade or update or get more extreme in what I'm doing during
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.540]   my exercise block, even if that's not, doesn't happen to be first thing in the morning.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:31.240]   That sort of self-reflection that like that one advantage you get out of the Hal Elrod
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.160]   sort of recentering your soul type morning ritual that also doesn't have to happen in
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   the morning.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.880]   Again, I find my self-reflection is not good in the morning until I've warmed up my brain
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.800]   circus and I've had some coffee and again, no offense to Andrew Huberman, but I'm not
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.920]   going to drink salted water instead of my first cup of coffee.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.300]   I don't care what it's doing to my biochemistry.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   Come on.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.380]   I will, I would give up a couple of years of life for that.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.580]   I'm not, I'm not good at self-reflection end of the day though.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.580]   It can be better.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.740]   In fact, like what I like to do with the self-reflection is go for a walk to do it.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:14.460]   And I find when a day is over and I've exercised, my brain can now reflect on myself better.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.220]   If I'm going to journal, if I'm going to, you know, maybe seek some meditation, I don't
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.560]   really have a monkey brain problem in the morning because I don't use social media.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.840]   I don't, my phone isn't super attractive to me.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.340]   Like I, and I'm, my brain doesn't work till I get coffee.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:33.020]   So I'm just sort of in a stupor until I'm like 20 minutes into my first deep work block.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.300]   So I, I figure maybe I should be a little bit more systematic about the self-reflection.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.060]   I've been working with single purpose journals a lot more recently.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.020]   I've been dealing with some, you know, recovering from an injury.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:48.420]   I've used that as a, an excuse to single purpose journal on some like life planning stuff and
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.840]   the more systematically get in thinking walks.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.380]   And so again, I think the value of some of those morning routines can be spread to other
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.460]   types of your day.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.540]   But the value of like doing deep work first thing in the morning and going outside first
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.020]   thing in the morning to wake up your body, that, that was the bit of everything I learned
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.460]   in this experiment.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.500]   That was the bit that was actually anchored to morning.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.380]   And that's the bit that I'm sort of leaning into and clarifying into my, into my own life.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.340]   And again, these type of weekly templates, it just depends on the season of life and
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.860]   the semester and what's going on and the, the summer is a completely different beast
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.860]   for me.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.860]   I'm not going to the bus stop in the morning.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.900]   I'm not teaching my schedules empty or I'll rethink that.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.900]   But right now that's what I took away from my journey into the morning routines.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:40.140]   And I will say, Jesse, that I was expecting more snake oil or more hustle culture stuff
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:45.860]   and it, some of it was kind of hustle culture, but like, honestly, I was often pretty commonsensical
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.780]   with like a couple random and take this supplement here or something like there'll be a couple
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.060]   random things thrown in that are maybe they're out over their skis.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:59.260]   I mean, maybe the biggest example was like how, how Elrod stuff, like that's a lot of
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.340]   stuff to do, like those six different things.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.940]   Like that's a long morning.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.020]   So maybe, but it doesn't, it doesn't feel hustling to me.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   I don't know.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.260]   I was expecting, I was expecting worse.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.660]   So have, did you start going to Bevco and then come to the HQ?
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.260]   Well, I mean, I just figured this out this morning.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:24.100]   So does Brad go on cold plunges or no, after his research, Brad is not a, I don't want
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.380]   to speak on his behalf, but I think I can confidently speak on his half that he's not
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.380]   a fan of cold plunges.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.060]   It is not against them, but he thinks it says arbitrary.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.540]   If he was here, he'd probably tell you it says arbitrary as, you know, I'm going to
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.460]   do 20 somersaults in the morning.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:44.500]   Like that there's not a, a specific therapeutic mechanism from cold plunging that is non trivially
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.760]   different than sort of any number of sort of like minor things you could do.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.340]   I tried the cold showers for a little while, then I just didn't make sense of me.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.340]   I'm like, I mean, I think we have hot water now.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:00.540]   I think it's all about, I think all of these things are all about the, the just signaling
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.980]   to yourself about discipline.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.020]   It's like Rogan.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.180]   I don't think he does the cold plunges as much anymore.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:11.300]   I think a lot of people move to saunas in part because I just think it's more reasonable.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.220]   Like it's just not as painful, like you're still like I'm in the sauna and it's really
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.260]   hot and but it's just not as terrible as the cold plunging.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.820]   So I mean, I think it's, I'm, I'm less of a cold plunge partisan because I never, I
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.860]   never listened to scientific reasons anyways, right.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.100]   You know, I think people got like a lot of motivation out of it.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.100]   I think that's fine.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.980]   I mean, they've had ice baths and professional sports locker rooms for a long time.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.620]   But from a motivation standpoint, it, it really works, right?
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.820]   Like if you're, everything's inflamed because you're like always kind of injured and yeah,
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.820]   that's true though.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.540]   I don't think people are using them therapeutically in that way, but I'm all for it.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:56.220]   I think if like, if I had like, I like saunas, if I, if I had room for a sauna at my house,
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.340]   I don't need the science on it.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.340]   I'd be like, this is great.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.220]   Like it kind of resets you.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.620]   It makes you feel like, okay, I've, I've, you know, you like shocked your body.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.620]   I think it's the same thing that people go for, you know, runs when it's cold outside.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.540]   It's like bracing and then you come back and everything feels sort of reset.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.220]   So you know, I'm not a partisan on it, but yeah, Brad has taught me that the science
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.100]   of the benefits is not super impressive.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.100]   All right.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.460]   So we've got some good questions coming up, but first let's take a brief break to hear
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.940]   from one of our sponsors.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:29.260]   I want to talk about one of my favorite products you hear me talk about all the time, Cozy
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.260]   Earth.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.740]   Why don't we make better sleep our new year resolutions this year.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.500]   And to do that, you have to use Cozy Earth's best selling bedding.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.080]   I absolutely love their bamboo sheet set.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.580]   We own multiple pairs of these so that we never have a lack of Cozy Earth sheets on
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.580]   our bed.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.060]   So if one pair is being washed, we have another pair ready to go on.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.820]   When we travel with our car, like if we're going to a rental house for the summer or
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.420]   something like this, my wife and I bring our Cozy Earth sheets with us.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.420]   We just really love them.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.740]   I'm a huge, I'm a huge proponent.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.540]   I think they're very comfortable and they're very breathable.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.900]   They don't sleep hot.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.360]   I want to mention another thing they have.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.540]   My wife has these, which is the bamboo pajama set, a timeless classic perfected at Cozy
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.540]   Earth.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.820]   They're crafted with a soft stretch knit that features enhanced breathability and luxurious
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.820]   drape.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.300]   I only, by the way, wear clothes that have luxurious drape.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:32.880]   I demand that when I go into the store, I say, yeah, but is this drape going to be luxurious?
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.580]   And then the guy says, sir, I don't know, this is a Costco, like the socks cost a dollar
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.580]   for 30.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.580]   I'm sure it's luxurious.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:44.500]   But anyways, we love the sheets so much, wearing the pajama sets, like having the sheets with
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   you at all times.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.220]   I have the sweatshirt kind of made out of similar material, which I love as well.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.100]   So anyways, Cozy Earth's goal is to help you turn your home into a sanctuary, a place where
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.820]   you can escape the outside world's demands and truly unwind.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.340]   Life gets hectic and finding comfort and calm is so important.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.620]   Your time outside the nine to five should be all about relaxing, recharging and soaking
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.620]   in a sense of peace.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.820]   We're talking about morning routines.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.820]   We'll start your morning right.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.820]   What's the right way to start it?
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.820]   Right.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.820]   Have the sheets, have the PJs.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   So anyways, I'm a big fan.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.820]   A better year starts with better sleep.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.380]   Wrap yourself in Cozy Earth.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380]   Don't wait.

[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.460]   If you get a post-purchase survey, take a second to say you heard about Cozy Earth from
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.900]   the Deep Questions podcast because then they know you came from me.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.900]   All right.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:48.940]   Speaking about sleep, I also want to talk briefly about our friends at Lofty, L-O-F-T-I-E.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.940]   Now here's my question.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.940]   We're talking about sleep.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.460]   We're talking about mornings.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.940]   What if your mornings didn't have to start with an annoying jolt, but with calm, focus
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.540]   and energy?
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.820]   Lofty is here to change the way you wake up and help you sleep better while you're at
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820]   it.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:09.580]   If improving your sleep routine is a top priority for 2025, meet the Lofty Clock, a bedside
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:16.620]   essential engineered by sleep experts to transform both your bedtimes and your mornings.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.460]   So what you do, and by the way, these are really good-looking products.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:25.380]   It's a sort of like nice modern design and you don't see the numbers sort of glow out.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.520]   They're really good-looking products.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.020]   What happens is that it helps you wind down at night, but more importantly, wakes you
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.860]   up gently with a two-phase alarm, so you get a soft wake-up sound to ease you in the consciousness,
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.340]   followed by a more energizing get-up sound to help you start your day so you kind of
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.780]   aren't just jolted out of a deep sleep.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.980]   They have sound options for everyone, including sound machines.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.440]   You have a sound machine built into the clock with over 100 options, including white noise
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.320]   or nature sounds, and it looks beautiful.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.340]   No reason to have your phone sitting by your bed to act as your alarm clock.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.660]   You should get a Lofty.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.100]   You know, Jesse, I learned doing my research on morning rituals for the deep dive.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:05.100]   I learned who really needs a Lofty is Jocko Willink, because what Jocko does, I now know
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.260]   too much about Jocko Willink right now.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:14.620]   What Jocko does for his morning routine is he found a specific song that starts kind
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:21.220]   of gently and then gets more progressively rocky and loudy, and so he somehow sets up
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:27.260]   his phone to start playing the song at a certain time to try to simulate what you get much
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   more precisely with a Lofty, which does like this soft sound.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.580]   You kind of get these soft sounds that sort of brings you out of sleep, and then it sort
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.900]   of gets louder.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.060]   So Jocko needs a Lofty.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.700]   He's trying to simulate this with a phone, and then he has the phone there, and now you're
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.700]   checking it and use the Lofty.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:48.460]   So you can join over 100,000 blissful sleepers who have upgraded their rest and mornings
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.740]   with Lofty.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:57.980]   Go to buylofty.com, B-Y-L-O-F-T-I-E.com and use DEEP20 for 20% off orders over $100.

[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.820]   All right, Jesse, let's get back to the show.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.340]   All right, who do we have for our first question of the day?
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.660]   First question is from Joseph.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.980]   I'm a big consumer of online content, podcasts, YouTube videos, and Twitter feeds.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.100]   I'm trying to reduce my content consumption.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.340]   I struggle with selecting which podcast episodes are worth my time.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.340]   Most podcasters I follow are very interesting and upload once a week.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.420]   Do you have advice on how to determine which episodes are worth watching and which I should
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.420]   skip?
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.440]   Well, I mean, I think the preferred thing to do here is what you want to do is get at
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.180]   least four or five complete listens of deep questions with Cal Newport per day, but you
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.620]   want to use a different device for each of those listens so that it counts as a different
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.620]   listener.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.180]   So all I'm suggesting here is you buy like 20 to 30 iPhones and spend most of your day
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.780]   just generating fresh downloads.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.340]   Joseph, here's my bigger advice here.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.620]   The theme to my advice to you, first of all, is we can kind of chill out.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.060]   The stakes here are low, right?
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:13.300]   So we want to release this idea that there's some optimal way to listen the podcast that
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.900]   you can miss out on.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.420]   You're not going to get anything wrong here.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.440]   The stakes here are very low.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.540]   So then when we think about how we should think about podcast content, here's the way
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.060]   I like to think about it.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:30.540]   There's two modes I'm normally in when I'm playing audio content.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:37.020]   Either it's a high energy mode, you know, like it's early in the day, I'm out walking,
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:44.120]   I'm driving to work, my energy is high, in that type of mode, I want to hear something
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.320]   interesting or engaging.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.900]   For me, I'm often looking for like an interview that is going to like spark ideas for me like,
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.500]   "Hey, there's something in here maybe I could write about or it's a world I want to learn
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.180]   about an interesting world or I'm looking for motivation."
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.040]   And then there is the second state, which is low energy.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.860]   I'm doing the dishes, it's nine o'clock at night, I'm tired, I'm stressed out by work,
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:09.660]   I do not have the energy or interest right now in getting like excited about ideas and
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.460]   I want something just entertaining.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.740]   And so then you're looking at like I want something funny, I want to just kind of get
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:21.060]   lost in something, you know, I'm just doing something boring and I'm out of mental energy.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.460]   So those are the two modes.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:30.960]   So your only goal is to have more than enough stuff to pull from for both of those modes
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.260]   so that you're just avoiding the null situation of having nothing to listen to in those circumstances.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.260]   And when you think about it that way, you're like, "Oh, it's fine.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.420]   There's an abundance of things I could pull from when I'm looking for like an idea generating
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.720]   podcast and there's an abundance of like fun or funny podcasts I can pull from when I'm
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.060]   low energy.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.380]   And so I don't have to stress about it."
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.540]   So you subscribe to, you know, you discover podcasts the way you discover podcasts, you
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.460]   got 20 or 30 you subscribe to and then you just see like which one's catching my attention.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.880]   Once you stop worrying about, "Oh, am I missing something?
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   Am I doing this suboptimally?"
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.080]   It just becomes a lot easier.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.000]   This is how I often engage with podcasts.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's very random.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.880]   I kind of subscribe to things as I hear about them or I follow an author or a thinker to
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   a podcast just to hear that author be interviewed.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.960]   I'm like, "Oh, I like this interviewer.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   Maybe I'll just subscribe to it."
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.120]   And then I'm just, I'm in this mode.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.840]   Let me look at podcasts that match that mode.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.080]   First thing that catches my attention, I go, "No regrets."
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.920]   You know, so I hear what I hear.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.460]   Like, Jesse, you're always asking me like, "Hey, did you hear so-and-so interview or
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.460]   that interview?"
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.460]   It's just random.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.260]   Like sometimes I did, sometimes, you know, I didn't.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.380]   So I don't, especially like interview podcasts, I don't serially consume a lot of podcasts.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.380]   All right.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.500]   I then have, the exception to all of this is what I think of as the like scheduled podcast.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:48.680]   So like our podcast, I know this sounds self-serving, but our podcast, our schedule is invented
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.180]   for this to come out at a certain time where it solves a certain problem, where a Monday
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:58.080]   morning podcast, we're meant to be a part of your ritual, like Monday morning on your
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:04.620]   way to work, you listen to it to sort of get back into the mindset of, you know, deep work
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.620]   and the deep life.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:11.300]   To come out of the weekend, start thinking again about being careful about how you navigate
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.100]   the modern digital environment, careful about how you're going to approach the morass that
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.520]   is your knowledge work job, careful in how you think about like what's working and not
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.120]   working or changes you want to make.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.520]   It's like a wake up for the week type podcast.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.720]   There's a bunch of them out there that are, that are tied to like a certain time to have
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   a certain purpose.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.520]   And so of course, those I think of as like, I know when I consume those, that's like ritualistic
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.560]   podcast consumption.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   So we put these all together.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.920]   You've got your ritualistic podcast, always listen to this day, this time, this day, every
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   week.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.520]   Because they like, it's just a nice part of my routine and they serve some purpose.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.040]   Then you're just pulling from these two other poles depending on your, your energy.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.120]   Like I've got a hold for that second category, low energy.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:54.720]   I love comedy in particular, it's not so much stand up comedians, it's interesting.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:01.700]   I like improv style comedians doing like interview shows like, you know, it's like the obvious
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.700]   things.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   Conan.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.700]   He was like an improv master.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.560]   I like the smartless guys because well, Will Arnett and Jason Bateman are actually like
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.640]   a fantastic like improv duo.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.720]   Sometimes like when I'm in my lowest energy state, it's a little bro-y sometimes, but
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.440]   sometimes when my lowest energy state, I love how does this get made?
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.160]   Which is Paul Scheer and Jason Manzoukas and June Diane Riefeld who are like all three
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.720]   like very famous accomplished improv comedy actors and they just review movies basically.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.440]   I have to be in like a certain state for that, but when I'm in my certain state, like I was
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.600]   there the other day and I was like, I just need to listen to them talk about Con Air
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:45.120]   and it was like exactly what I needed and it was exactly what you would expect.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   And it is a fantastic movie and it all makes sense and it all checks out.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:54.740]   The reason why I said it was bro-y, they're not bro-y, but years ago, Julie and I went
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.400]   to see them live and they're at Constitution Hall, Jesse.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.240]   That's a big venue.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.340]   And the audience was very bro-y.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:11.000]   That's what caused, like they're not, they're, you know, whatever famous comedic actors from
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.400]   like the Hollywood left who are in their 50s, but the audience was very, we're like, oh,
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.680]   this is a lot of 24-year-olds who like just still go back to their frat sometimes.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.400]   It's like the audience is bro-y, but I love them.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.920]   I think they're very funny.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.760]   And then for the Idea Podcast, it's, I mean, it's often shows I've been on.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.320]   This is not a replicatable strategy, but if I've been on a show and like the interviewer,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.120]   I'll often subscribe to it and there it's all like topic hunting.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.960]   There's very few of those shows I listen to everything, I see who they have on.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:45.920]   It's like, if I like who Sam Harris has on, on Making Sense, if I like the topic, I know
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.000]   Sam's going to give a really interesting like interview, you know, and I'll listen to that.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.040]   I like, like we like the Acquired Podcast for me, it depends on like what the company
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   is.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.840]   But if I like the company, sometimes like that's what, you know, that's what I really
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   want to do.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.800]   You know, all of the main interviewers, I'm going to subscribe to those podcasts and just
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.440]   I see what I'm in the mood for.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   All right.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.160]   I don't have much thinking about podcast listening, but there you go.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.980]   I love the Con Air's statement.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:19.360]   It's a fantastic, look, that's my, that's our, we were, that's, we would have been like
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.320]   junior high, high school in that Nicolas Cage era, Con Air, The Rock, The Rock is a fantastic
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.320]   movie.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   Here's the thing about these movies.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.920]   They're all rated R because I want to show my kids, it's like, why, why were all these
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   movies?
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.160]   They didn't have to be rated R. Everything was rated R in the nineties.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.160]   Like movies you would not think, I think this was a marketing thing.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:47.000]   Like think about the Harrison Ford movie, Air Force One, remember this movie?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.560]   Like what's the guy's name, Rodchenko, separatists from Rodchenko, whatever.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:58.120]   There's always like Eastern vaguely like Russian, ex-Russian sphere of influence, terrorists
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.560]   taking things over in these movies.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.560]   A great movie, right?
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.320]   It's the, they take over Air Force One, terrorists take over Air Force One, Harrison Ford's the
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.720]   president fights back.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720]   Perfect premise.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.720]   It's a rated R movie.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.720]   Like why is it?
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.360]   It doesn't have to be a rated R movie, right?
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.240]   It's not like in the middle of this movie, there's like a gratuitous, you know, basic
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.880]   instinct style sex scene or anything.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.760]   It's just like, they would just make these things R rated.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.820]   Crimson Tide.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.820]   Love that movie.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.820]   The submarine one, right?
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.820]   Submarine one.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820]   That's awesome.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.820]   Tony Scott.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.040]   So like the camera's like always moving.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.840]   By the way, and I don't mean to rant about this, but my brother was in the submarine
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.120]   service and I had to ask him about this.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.040]   There are, maybe I've talked about this on the show before, but there are several, it's
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.760]   crazy the things, some of the, some of the submarine stuff I would say was not deeply
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   researched.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.720]   Let's say Tony Scott did not care.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.200]   So for example, and I'll leave it at this, but when it's time to get the order to fire
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.120]   the missile, spoiler alert, right?
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:59.440]   The whole job of these boomers is to be deadly silent holes in the water.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.240]   And so they can just come out of like nothingness and then suddenly fire their missiles when
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   they get to.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.920]   And on these subs, my brother tells me about this, like you drop a wrench a hundred miles,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   you can be heard, right?
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.600]   So they wear a new balance tennis shoes and it's all like very careful.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.840]   How does Tony Scott portray, okay, it's time to fire the missiles in real life.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   What would it be?
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.240]   It'd be like, okay, so what we're doing is what we trained for quiet, calm.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   He has clacks and sirens go off in the submarine, clacks and sirens, just like really loud sirens
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.600]   and everyone is running.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.160]   Everyone's always running up and downstairs.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.240]   Anyways, interesting thing about crimson tide though, uncredited screenwriting help
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.880]   for that movie came from Quentin Tarantino.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.440]   So you'll see that like where they have that weird sort of like racially charged conversation
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:53.480]   about the, the lip stallion stallions between Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.000]   That's all Quentin Tarantino.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.200]   You weren't happy about the nuclear sound stuff in that book too, that came about the
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.440]   nuclear war book.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.920]   Yeah, they had the same, the same thing as, so maybe they watched.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:09.100]   So I'm thinking Annie Jacobson who did tons of research for that book when it came time
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:14.260]   to do the submarine scene, I think she just watched crimson tide.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.260]   I love Tony Scott movie.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:21.840]   My six year old loves Tony Scott's, because I show my kids, yeah, I love movies.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:29.920]   Tony Scott's unstoppable, Chris Pine, Denzel Washington, freight train full of deadly chemicals.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.600]   It's our unmanned runaway train.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.280]   If it hits the city, it's going to explode and kill like all these people, 70 miles per
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   hour.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.520]   The break is broken.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.720]   And the, and so how do you stop it?
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   That's the whole movie.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.760]   And it's just constantly swooping by the train with Tony Scott helicopters.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   It awesome.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.080]   It's a great movie.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   And that's, but see, like that's not our, they stopped making all these movies are rated
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.080]   at some point in the 2000s.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   Like, well, this is stupid.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.240]   It wasn't, it's just, it's two guys in a train, you know, just, we can, they'll curse a little
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.060]   bit and why we don't have to make it R. All right, Joseph.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.560]   Your kids will be old enough soon enough to watch radar movies.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.520]   My, I mean, I selectively show my 12 year old just because I know the movies really
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:14.120]   well and sometimes I do some edits, but yeah, the R rating is not stopping me with him.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   All right.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.800]   So Joseph, I hope that answers your question.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.120]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.920]   Next question is from Paula.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.040]   How does Cal track daily steps?
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.120]   I imagine he doesn't use a smartwatch.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.240]   I have a love-hate relationship with my Apple watch.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.680]   I've tried to turn off notifications, but I'm curious about alternative approaches.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.280]   I mean, everyone uses Apple watches.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.080]   I'm not a big Apple watch fan.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.520]   I remember writing about the Apple watch when it first came out.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.040]   So it's worth going back and finding this article at calnewport.com from when the Apple
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.920]   watch first came out because it captures a reality about that product's launch, which
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.200]   is when the Apple watch was released, they had no idea what it was for.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.720]   This was like one of Tim Cook's first move was a post jobs after Steve Jobs died.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.440]   One of the first big product deployments that Tim Cook oversaw, if I'm remembering this
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.680]   time, like history was the Apple watch and they had no use case for it.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.280]   They're like, we have a watch, like a lot of people bought it.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.800]   And I remember writing an article saying it's not our job to figure out what the Apple watch
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.920]   should be used for.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   That's Apple's job.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.060]   Like they have to tell us, like make a pitch, here's how you're going to use it.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.680]   After like a year or so, it kind of shook out like their planned work.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.160]   People just used it and they said, what did people like about it?
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.340]   It shook out that people wanted it for like fitness stuff.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.760]   And so then it became more of like a fitness, fitness aid.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.000]   But no, I don't use an Apple watch.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.240]   I have my, my day-to-day watch is actually a Zen 105, which is a full automatic.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.520]   So there's no electricity or batteries in this beast.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:48.160]   It's just a sort of German workhorse of a watch that harnesses my arms motion.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.600]   And it's, it's pretty accurate.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.200]   I can stick within a few minutes.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.760]   The movement, it's a Salido movement customized by Zen.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.600]   I can get, I don't know, stay with some like three minutes per week without any winding.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   So cool watch.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   Steps.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   All right.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:09.240]   So what I did for a long time and I might go back to is I just bought a watch battery
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.880]   powered pedometer that's you've seen it, Jesse.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.240]   It's like, I don't know, for those who are watching like that big.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.320]   So I kind of the size of like a lighter, you know?
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.440]   And all it did, I love single purpose technologies.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.720]   All it does is you, you have to press these buttons.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:32.000]   It's very hard to set the time, but you set the time and then all it does is keep track
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.920]   of your steps just based on its motion.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   And it resets at midnight.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.160]   Just like pull out your pocket.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.200]   How many steps have I done today?
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.160]   The problem is I kept losing them because you forget to take it out of your pocket and
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.160]   then like they're in the hamper.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:48.000]   So then I ended up with like two or three of them and I would, I lost this one.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.960]   I'd find another one, but I love the single, the single use technology.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.440]   It wasn't super accurate to be honest, but none of these technologies are.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.160]   Michael Easter wrote about this last year, some research where they, they, it was actually
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   pretty cool.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.720]   They tested like all these pedometers and like none of them are accurate, but it doesn't
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   really matter.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.400]   It's kind of relative to itself.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.640]   So I haven't used those recently.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.040]   The batteries all died and I haven't been step counting as much recently.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.660]   I started step counting more as part of recovery, this injury recovery I'm doing.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:18.280]   And I just was using my, my phone is often in my pocket and it just has, it just automatically
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.520]   tracks stuff in the fitness app.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.760]   I don't know how accurate that is, but that's what I've been doing.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.600]   I think I'm going to go back to a standalone pedometer again.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   I'm wondering if there's, I think there's better ones.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.600]   I think there's really good.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:35.120]   I think the best ones, you like clip on your belt and I think it's going to make me look
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.120]   awesome.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   Unless you're wearing sweatpants.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:43.040]   Well, I, which I am, well, I think what I'm going to do, and this is more reasonable and
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.000]   accurate is, you know, the wheel things, it's like a wheel on a stick.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   It's how you like accurately.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.200]   Let's walk around with one of those constantly like pushing my, my wheel on a stick.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.800]   Anyways, I love standalone pedometers.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.280]   If someone knows of a really good one, small, it's very accurate.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.520]   You don't have to use an iPhone.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.280]   Tell Jesse, jesse@calnewport.com because I'm, I'm in the market.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   It's funny.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.160]   I just finished the Michael Lewis SBF book and he was talking about when he was in high
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.080]   school, he brought a roller bag to high school.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   You feel it everywhere.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.440]   That's exactly what I was thinking when you were talking about the Lewis.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   SPF did or Michael Lewis?
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.440]   SPF did.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.440]   Michael Lewis seems like a cool guy.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   That tracks.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.440]   That tracks.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.760]   Now, you know, now everyone has to carry, it's different than when we were kids.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:31.960]   Now, um, you carry like a middle school, these like briefcases basically, it's like a trapper
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.720]   keeper with a handle.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.960]   It's like this thick and like all the kids, you just, what you carry and then you have
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   a backpack.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.300]   So, so you don't need to roll or you carry this thing and you have your, and you have
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   your backpack.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   All right.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.300]   Who do we got next?
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   All right.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.300]   Next question is from Lindsay.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.600]   Is it okay to have different office hours throughout the week depending on my schedule?
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.920]   So sometimes higher up schedule meetings that I have to accept, how should I manage office
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.400]   hours in those cases?
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.800]   Well, first of all, congrats for doing the office hour strategy.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.000]   For people who don't know very briefly, this is the strategy where you have set times on
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.760]   set days in which you are available for incoming communication, office door open, your phone
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   is on.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   If you, if there's a chat service, your company uses like Slack, you're in a channel ready
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:18.680]   to chat and you use this to defer, uh, as much as possible, any sort of back and forth
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:22.000]   communication that requires more than you just responding to a message with a single
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   message.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.120]   You say, why don't you just grab me at my office hours?
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.880]   And this actually breaks up or eliminates a bunch of ad hoc back and forth exchanges.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   And those are the real killers.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.280]   We always talk about the real killers of your, your energy and concentration is having to
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.440]   monitor inboxes for these back and forth conversations.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.760]   So you want to try to eliminate those with office hours.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.120]   Uh, okay.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:46.600]   It's okay if your office hours shift a little bit, right?
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.040]   Because like typically what's happening is no one knows what your office hours are.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   So you're, you're typically telling people when you were diffusing one of these back
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.040]   and forths.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:02.360]   Like it's often, Hey Jesse, what do you think about, like, what should we do for the timing
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.600]   for the upcoming client conference?
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   Like, Oh, this is a back and forth.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.840]   It's usually you're replying to that.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.200]   Like, that's a good question.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.300]   We should get into this.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.360]   If you can just like swing by, you know, call me during one of my office hours this week
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.280]   and we can figure it out.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   Paste what those are.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.680]   Like just have a text file on your desktop with here's where they are this week.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.360]   And you just like paste that in, right?
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   And then they just like, okay, great.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.880]   I'll, I'll call them at one of those times.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.320]   So if you see something gets scheduled and you're kind of shifting them around, it doesn't
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.600]   really matter.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.240]   Um, because, because people are hearing about your office hours sort of on demand.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.200]   So that's one thing to keep in mind.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.360]   A second thing to keep in mind is protect the office hours like other meetings.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:42.360]   So like, especially if there's a shared calendar system, more and more companies do this because
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.760]   we, we, we over meet.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.840]   Why do we over meet?
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:49.600]   Because we have a workloads that are too high, but more and more companies like Georgetown
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.600]   will do this.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.320]   For example, you'll have a community shared calendar that's communal.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.440]   So that when a higher up, like a fancy person in your company wants to set up a meeting
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.360]   with people more and more, what'll happen at these companies is they'll have one of
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.480]   their assistants.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.720]   Look at everyone's calendar, find a time that works and then send out an invitation.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.040]   This has become like the new way that higher ups deal with calendars, right?
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.320]   Because a higher up is not going to waste his or her time with like, and well, when
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   are you available?
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   What about this?
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.320]   Or what about that?
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.840]   And so there's like more and more of this is going on.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.240]   So all you have to do is your office hours just go on your calendar like any other meeting.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.080]   So when these meetings are being set up automatically, those times just aren't considered.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.800]   So you have to like show respect to your office hours, treat it like if you already had a
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:39.000]   meeting with like your team lead and then your, your boss is like, Hey, can we meet
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   at blah, blah, blah time?
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.680]   And you're like, well, no, I'm already have a meeting then, but I'm free after before
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:45.360]   and you like give all the other times you're like, we're, we're kind of used to that convention.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:50.640]   So it's okay if your office hours have to shift because most people are finding out
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.800]   about them as they need them and to treat the office hours like a meeting that's already
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   on your calendar.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.440]   And then you can kind of protect that time.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.920]   Like you would protect any other meeting that was on your calendar, then just follow the
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   same conventions.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.480]   Like, let's say like the CEO of your major company, you know, chief of staff is like,
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.240]   she needs to meet you at three on Monday.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:13.680]   You know, I get these summons sometimes, not summons, but like at the university level,
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   this will be typically like the provost or the president.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.120]   If the provost or the president wants to talk to me, typically they're just telling you,
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.320]   uh, Hey, can you come by at like blah, blah, blah, because their schedule is so full.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.480]   It's like, this is the slot.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.480]   Okay.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.560]   So if it's something where you would, you would overwrite or reschedule an existing
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:36.640]   meeting with someone else, then you would overwrite it and cancel your office hours.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.920]   If it's something where you want it, you would say, no, no, I'm already busy then, then,
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.600]   and then, but here's what I'm available.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   Then don't reschedule your office hours.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.040]   So just treat it like you would any other meeting on your schedule.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.800]   I get burned with this shared calendar thing all the time, Jesse, because I have multiple
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.800]   calendars, right?
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.720]   You know, I have my Georgetown calendar, but like so much of my life has run, my writing
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:59.600]   life has all this other obligations and I don't keep that on my Georgetown calendar.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.440]   So what'll happen is with higher ups, they'll often just get this meeting invite.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.600]   We'll just show up and they'll be like, yeah, we looked at your calendar.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   And so as far as they're concerned, these assistants must think I'm so lazy because
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.800]   I don't, there's nothing on my Georgetown calendar.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.240]   Otherwise you'd have to go through your Georgetown calendar and put fake things in that codes
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   like for your other calendar.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.240]   Which would be like a, yeah.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.200]   So instead what happens, I'm just constantly having to be like, I'm sorry, like I don't
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:25.080]   actually use this Georgetown calendar, but I'm not available any of these times.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:29.200]   Maybe I should consolidate my calendar, but the issue is it's complicated because I share
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.880]   my calendar with my wife and she doesn't need to see all the Georgetown things.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:38.480]   And I, I have things I don't want, I, you know, as I use three calendars, it's the moral
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.480]   of the story.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:44.040]   You probably could spend like two to three minutes and put in those like blocks of meetings,
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.720]   you know, as just like fake code.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:53.040]   There's probably a way to, I can import my other calendar to my Georgetown calendar and
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.800]   have a show up automatically.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.320]   But yeah, I don't, I just annoy people.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   All right.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.320]   Who do we got next?
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   Next question is from Luke.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.760]   I'm 25 and a post-production producer at a large marketing agency.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.560]   My long-term goal is to make feature films, but I took this job to build career capital
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.720]   and expand my experience beyond my video production skills.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.160]   My role involves no creative work, just managing emails, coordinating teams, and ensuring client
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.160]   deliverables.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.280]   How do you know if I'm staying in this role is, I don't, how do I know if I'm staying
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.000]   in this role is worth it for career capital or if it's time to quit and pivot towards
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.320]   something more aligned with my aspirations?
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   Well, I think there's a couple of things going on here, Luke.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.280]   So one is your specific aspiration for feature films and two is just a more general question
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   of how do you decide, like, is this job right for me and whether, despite the specifics
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   of the job.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.600]   When it comes to feature films, I was actually just, you know, I like movies.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.520]   I read a lot of books about movies.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.980]   I was just reading or listening to a book, maybe this was in the book we talked about
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:57.000]   from December Books on the 1989, the sci-fi movies from 1989.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   And maybe it was Ridley Scott.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.040]   I don't quite remember which director was talking about this, but basically they had
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.360]   this advice, which stuck out to me that I think is relevant here as well.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:12.680]   They said when it comes to like feature film directing, there's not a ladder, like, so
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:18.240]   this idea of like, well, let me just get my foot in the door in like that industry.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.280]   And then I'll slowly kind of like move my way up and work my way up these, like, that's
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.940]   not how it works.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.160]   You have to just start directing.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.240]   This might've been Chris Nolan who was talking about this.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.280]   Like you got to just as quickly as possible, find a way to make a movie and make it good.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Like I got the money from here and there.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   It's small.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.200]   It's a short, but like makes, you gotta be making movies.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.960]   Like the directors just come in directing, like I'm a director, I'm directing, you know,
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   here's a movie I did.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.960]   Here's a short.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.680]   Sometimes this could be commercial directing, like Ridley Scott came out of commercial directing,
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.840]   like that's where he could get work, you know, okay, but I'm, I'm directing stuff and now
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.560]   I want to do movies.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.960]   Don't they're saying there's not, don't become an AD and then work your way up to be an assistant
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.880]   director and we're like, that doesn't work.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.800]   There's a talent mindset in Hollywood that says like, if you're meant to be a good director,
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.520]   you should just come onto the scene guns blazing, like directing cool stuff.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.560]   Oh, look at all this talent.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.240]   Let's like give them a bigger movie to try.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.520]   It's not a, like you worked your way up type of thing.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:17.840]   So no post-production producing at large market agency, when it comes to your aspiration to
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.280]   be a feature film director, I mean, you might as well be at like a computer software firm
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   or a truck driver or something.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   It's just not related.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.520]   It's not going to make a difference.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.880]   The bigger question here though is like, how do you know in general, if staying in a place
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.840]   is worth your career cap, is it worth it?
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.160]   Are you, are you acquiring enough career capital?
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.440]   Should you be switching to another job?
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:43.400]   Is this not, is this not going to support a vision you have, you know, how do you actually
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.400]   do that?
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.280]   There's two things that matter.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.840]   Lifestyle centric planning and evidence-based planning, right?
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.920]   So lifestyle centric planning means, you know what it is you're aiming towards and it's
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.240]   not a specific job so much as like, here's all the aspects of the life I want to have
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.280]   in five years and 15 years.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.040]   That type of specificity now allows you to say, am I acquiring the right type of career
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:10.600]   capital at this particular job that I see how, like I have the path in mind that if
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.040]   I get better at this, I'll be able to change my position to be this and this position will
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.800]   be compatible with this and that's going to match like a lot of the stuff I want in my
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   lifestyle.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.120]   So you're, you're, you're working towards a particular goal.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.000]   Now you can get very clear about specifically what you're doing, is specifically what I'm
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.280]   doing going to help me get there.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.100]   Evidence-based planning says when it comes to like particular stuff you're doing as part
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.520]   of these lifestyle plans, do you have evidence from real people who know what they're talking
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.560]   about that the thing you're doing will work?
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.520]   Like lifestyle centric planning is how you figure out like this is what I'm aiming towards
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.120]   and I'm working backwards from that and building plans of like how do I get closer to that
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.320]   giving my unique opportunities and obstacles.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.600]   The evidence-based component is making sure you're not telling yourself stories as part
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.520]   of that effort.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.720]   Make sure you haven't written your own story about what you think matters as opposed to
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.760]   learning from people what really matters.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.280]   Like the advice I gave you earlier in my answer about how people become feature film directors.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.180]   That's like an example of evidence-based planning.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.760]   You might want the story to be, I'm doing production at a marketing company which will
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.920]   lead to this, which will lead to this and then finally I'll get my shot as being a director.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.560]   You might want that to be the right story but then you talk to real people who know
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.320]   what's going on and you get, you Sandy check your plan, they say that's not going to get
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.580]   you anywhere near where you want to go.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.840]   Now evidence-based planning, you say why would people avoid this step?
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.320]   Well, they avoid this step because you sometimes get an answer that is not what you want to
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320]   hear.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.120]   Sometimes you get the answer of like, oh, that's how people do this?
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.460]   I'm not going to be able to do that or I tried that and it didn't go well, right?
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.200]   So there can be some reality checks that happen with evidence-based planning.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.960]   I may want to get to this place.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.320]   I may want this plan, this piece of my plan to work.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.320]   But what I'm doing is not going to work and what I would have to do, I'm not capable of
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.560]   doing or I tried and I failed.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.600]   I don't have that talent.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   I don't have that access.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.920]   It's too late.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.460]   So evidence-based planning can be pretty scary because it reality checks you.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:05.480]   But those reality checks are often liberating because you say, okay, well, what's next?
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.840]   And the thing you want to fall back to is your lifestyle-centric vision and you say,
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.280]   okay, there's other ways to get to that.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.920]   That's why I love about lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.200]   You might have a whole lifestyle, creative lifestyle vision that your plan to get there
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.160]   is built around being a director and maybe you find like that's not reasonable.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.480]   Well, you still have that lifestyle image.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.480]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.000]   I just moved your camera, Jesse.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   All good.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.120]   Speaking of directors, that was like a, you know, you know what they call that what I
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   just did there, Jesse?
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:38.240]   So people who are watching, I had to laterally move the camera back on Jesse's head.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.240]   That's called a swishpan.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.240]   Is it?
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   Swishpan Jesse.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   What I'm trying to say is I should be a director, but we have lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.400]   We're like, okay, this, I had this way of getting to this lifestyle that's built on
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.120]   like, you know, directing for whatever reason, that's not, I got some evidence-based reality
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   check.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   That's not going to work.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120]   Well, what were the aspects of this lifestyle?
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.720]   I really liked, you know, I could, I could still capture those with this other way.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   Okay.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.160]   Maybe I'm not going to be a feature film director, but I could be X, Y, and Z because actually
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.800]   this is what was important to me and you, you, you find other ways to get there.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.680]   It's the, it's the most flexible planning methodology I know, because you have all of
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.240]   these possible routes forward in your life.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.300]   Your life forward is all of these branching trees that, that exponentially grow and covers
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.360]   all this land.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360]   You see each of those as paths.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.280]   There's so many paths to navigate there.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.560]   You always have so many more options.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.520]   It's so much more freeing than grand goal-based planning in which you're just fixated on a
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   particular path.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.000]   And if that path doesn't work, you're out of luck.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.360]   And if that path does work and you discover it doesn't fix everything, you're even more
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.020]   out of luck.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.260]   So embrace the flexibility of lifestyle centric planning, and then use evidence-based planning
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.500]   to make sure that your, your ideas for how you're going to move forward actually makes
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   sense.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   All right.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.700]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.700]   We have our corner.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.060]   Ooh, this is where each week we take a question related to my new book.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.620]   I can't say new book anymore, Jesse.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.100]   It's been out for 10 months now.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.100]   We came up with some good rules on the last episode.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.100]   What did we decide?
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.100]   One year mark.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.100]   One year mark.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.100]   Okay.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.100]   So we, okay.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.100]   So for, I'm going to call it my new book until we stopped doing the corner.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.100]   Okay.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.540]   So my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.260]   Every week we do a question relating to it and we do it so that we have an excuse to
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:17.780]   play the official theme music for the segment, which we'll hear now.
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.660]   All right.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.260]   What's our slow productivity corner question of the week?
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.220]   It's from Christy and it's about office hours again.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.040]   So she says, I'm a software engineer and recently read Slow Productivity.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.140]   I set up office hours twice a week.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.740]   I've also blocked off Wednesdays as meeting free days.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.940]   However, people disregard these and still schedule meetings on Wednesdays.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.060]   I'm fed up.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:46.100]   How can I politely and effectively communicate, reject meetings on these days?
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:51.560]   Again, I think this goes back to, and office hours I should say is discussed in more length
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:58.120]   and slow productivity because principle one, doing fewer things.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:02.060]   Part of that principle talks about how you reduce just the load of what you're juggling
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.060]   in any one moment and office hours is a fantastic strategy in there, along with many others
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.940]   including like pulling versus pushing, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:09.940]   All right.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.380]   This goes back to do not treat office hours differently than other meetings.
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:19.620]   It lives on your calendar in the same way that, you know, meet with Bob from marketing
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.440]   lives on your calendar.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.660]   And deal with meeting requests the same way you deal with meetings.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.820]   It's all homogeneous now.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.940]   Hey, let's meet on Wednesday.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:28.940]   How about two?
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.740]   You're like, no, I'm busy from one to three, but I'm free from three to five.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.740]   I'm free from two to whatever.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:39.460]   You just deal with it like the way you would deal with any other meeting.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.180]   And again, the rules I talked about before apply here.
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.540]   You would only preempt that meeting, your office hours for another meeting, if you would
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:50.340]   have preempted a meeting with Bob from marketing for that new meeting.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:55.180]   So again, if it's super urgent and a higher up and you would normally cancel another meeting
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:59.460]   that was already in place to do this new meeting, then do the same for office hours.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:06.180]   But if you would not cancel an existing meeting, right, for this new meeting being proposed,
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.560]   don't do that for office hours either.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:14.260]   Treat it with parity to how you would treat existing meetings.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:18.260]   If you're struggling, it might be the case that your office hours are too long.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.100]   That's like a common issue is that people will say, I'm going to have three hours on
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.660]   Wednesday afternoons and that's office hours and then people can come in.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.980]   And that might be too much time to consistently have blocked off, right?
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.500]   Because if someone, if Bob from marketing said, we should just have a three hour meeting
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.620]   every Wednesday, you'd be like, no, that's too many meetings, right?
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.340]   So that could be the other problem here is that your office hours are too long.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   Make them shorter.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.420]   Make it an hour.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.420]   People can come in and out.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.300]   You can get a lot done in an hour.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.300]   And then it won't be so hard.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.460]   It won't step on people's toes too much time, right?
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:50.920]   So just whatever you would do with a normal meeting, do that with your office hours.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.920]   I like office hours.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920]   I'm back.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.100]   So I'm teaching again this semester.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.180]   So I have like legitimate office hours again.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.260]   That's really nice.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.260]   Call me in my office hours.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.260]   All right.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.260]   What do we got?
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.260]   We got a call.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.540]   So you want, normally the last episode you said you wanted the theme music twice.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.540]   Do you want to hear it again?
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:06.540]   Oh, I forgot the rules.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.540]   Let's hear it one more time.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:17.940]   I'm going to miss it when we get to the, when we get to the one year, two more months.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.100]   Play it four times.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.580]   Because your book came out early March, right?
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   Early March.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.580]   You basically have two months from today.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.580]   We're getting there.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   I can put it on MP3.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.580]   You can listen to it on your walks.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:30.580]   I'm just going to.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.580]   With your new pedometer.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.580]   I'm going to look.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   So yeah.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:39.180]   I'll be wheeling my pedometer wheel and listening to slow productivity music on a Walkman.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180]   It'll be fantastic.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.180]   All right.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.180]   We got a call this week?
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.180]   We do.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.180]   All right.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.260]   Hi, Cal.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:51.540]   My name is Emil Folino and I've been a lecturer within computer science at the Swedish Higher
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.740]   Education Institute for the past eight plus years.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.180]   I've used some of your approaches to deep work and time management to become great at
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:05.460]   teaching, and was promoted to expert lecturer a couple of years ago.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:11.020]   I've now invested some of my career capital and will start doctoral studies in January,
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.980]   but with my lecturer salary.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.860]   To be able to obsess over quality, I will need to develop a new set of skills related
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.500]   to research.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:24.380]   As an experienced researcher, what general and specific skills would you recommend that
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.380]   I hone in on?
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.380]   All right.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:27.380]   That's a good question.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.380]   All right.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.580]   So this is someone who knows the field well.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.340]   They've been doing lecture and is going back to doctoral work while maintaining their lecturer
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.300]   position or salary, which is well played, by the way.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.300]   Right?
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.300]   That's a good move.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:45.740]   What do you need to know to do computer science research at a doctoral level or above really
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.740]   well?
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:50.380]   Here, I usually come back to a couple things.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.740]   One, it's really hard to find good problems.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.540]   There's like a real skill to that.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:01.340]   This is the right problem to look at next.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.820]   People have been looking at this, and this is like a natural follow up that applies some
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.580]   special skill our group has.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:08.780]   There's like a pattern to this.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.760]   It's usually in the adjacent possible.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:19.020]   So when you're a doctoral student, defer to more senior people for problem selection.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.120]   So if you're in a group that research is often done with your advisor, your advisor's going
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.720]   to have that sixth sense you don't have yet.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   Right?
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.360]   If you're working with other research groups, you kind of defer to more senior people.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:36.540]   Let them find or suggest what the problem, what the really interesting problem is.
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.720]   You can be kind of selective here.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.920]   Maybe people are, hey, do you want to work on this?
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920]   Do you want to work on that?
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.440]   It's scary if people just sort of like spitballing, like this could be interesting, that could
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.440]   be interesting.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   I would tie my ship closer to ideas that are coming out of existing research that's catching
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   attention.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.840]   It's a good place to be in your doctoral program.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.640]   There's some heat going on over here with this issue.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.520]   There's been a couple of big papers on it.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.480]   Like what are the natural follow up papers on this topic?
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   What's the natural next step?
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.860]   Like get in where there's already some heat while you're still a doctoral student.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.840]   The second thing I would say is more important than anything else is understanding existing
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.840]   research.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.800]   Look at the relevant papers and take the time to really understand them.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.080]   The most valuable doctoral students in most computer science groups are those who are
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.480]   reading and understand the literature relevant to the problems that they're supposed to be
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480]   working on.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.280]   If you want to make yourself really useful to your advisor, you come back and like I
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:31.720]   spent the week reading these three award winning papers from the conference that's relevant
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   to our field.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.960]   And here's what's going on and here's what they did and here's what they found and here's
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.640]   what their questions like you want to be.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   You want to be an expert.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.320]   I mean I remember this when I was post-docing.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.760]   So I'm a theoretician but I post-doced at MIT in a systems group, network and mobile
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   systems group.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   Hari Balakrishnan's group.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.320]   And I remember like one of the students, so they were doing a lot of work on wireless
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.080]   because I was doing theory about wireless distributed algorithm theory and sort of wireless
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.080]   environments.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.480]   And so I was going back to a systems group to bring some theory know-how but also to
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.200]   bring back some more systems know-how back to theory it was etc, etc.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.720]   I remember one of the students in this group when the new 802.11n standard came out which
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720]   was new at the time.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.240]   This would have been 2009, 2010.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.960]   They just disappeared and came back like a week later.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:28.020]   Okay, I have mastered, I've read all this, the impossibly obtuse opaque I should say
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.240]   technical documentation and read the early papers on it.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.720]   I now know exactly how this works and what the options are and what's happening here
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.800]   and I can, I'm an expert on this now and then we were able to or my advisor was able
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.680]   to harness that to say great, now let's find an interesting problem to look at.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.840]   This new standard came out, let's really understand it.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.040]   What is like an experiment we can run or an interesting thing we can follow?
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.000]   So like that student had made himself very useful by mastering that knowledge.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   In theory, this is even more clear.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.040]   The best papers come out of understanding the already good papers and it's really hard
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.560]   to understand papers in theory because again, they're complicated proofs and only some of
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560]   the steps are shown.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   I mean it's really, it's one of the hardest things I ever do intellectually is really
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.440]   understanding existing proofs in existing papers because you have to fill in a lot of
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.000]   gaps on your own.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.520]   But when you teach yourself the mathematics and the logic and understand a really complicated
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.080]   proof and you really internalize it, it opens up all of these options.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.000]   You take that same mechanics and you apply them over here.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.960]   You see a natural way to follow up.
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.480]   Well, their results were here.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.520]   I really understand this.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.440]   I'm also good at this like, I can bring in like whatever, like Martingale analysis, which
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.640]   they probably didn't know much about.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.600]   But if we can get away from being dependent on churn offs and throw in some like Martingale
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.800]   bounds, we can actually deal with these troublesome dependencies over here and lose that log factor.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.740]   Great, I'm going to take that hammer, I'm going to apply it over to this nail and now
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.840]   you have a follow-up paper and it's technical and it moves the state of the art forward.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.800]   All of this comes back to understanding papers.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.500]   So defer to the experts on like what are the good problems when you're still new and make
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.640]   yourself useful by reading what's already good and spending the time to understand what's
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   already good.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.520]   It's all about the reading.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.120]   All right, let's see.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.680]   We got a case study here.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.560]   We could, Jesse, instead discuss Martingale bounds instead of the case study.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:20.000]   I don't know what people would prefer, my misspent youth doing probabilistic analysis.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.360]   I've got a case study here.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.760]   This one comes from Justin.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:28.340]   This is where people write in the jesse@calnewport.com and talk about how they use the advice we
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.320]   discuss on the show in their own lives.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.960]   So Justin says, most of my career has been in people work, adults with disabilities,
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.860]   trauma-informed work with teens, and now as a pastor in a church.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:44.160]   The transition to pastoring was a significant adjustment and was hugely helped by your book's
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.400]   deep work in So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.520]   I was in my late 20s with a second kid on the way when I decided I did some, to do some
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.520]   lifestyle-centric planning that included no more shift work and the chance to be more
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.160]   open about my faith in my work with my people.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.620]   My intention was to be a pastor with time and energy for my wife and kids, living close
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.880]   to my family and the mountains here in Alberta, Canada.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:11.080]   So I quit my highly demanding youth and family counselor role to do a MA in seminary while
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.720]   working halftime as a church youth ministry director.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.280]   My undergrad five years earlier was really challenging with a little more prefrontal
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.940]   cortex and a lot more awareness of autopilot scheduling and deep work blocking.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:25.640]   I was able to do well in seminary, become licensed as a minister, grow my position at
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.160]   the church into a full-time role, get back into CrossFit and backcountry camping and
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.720]   be a present father and husband.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.800]   Pastoring has a ton of variety and flexibility and infinite opportunities.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.480]   So your MSP teaching has been huge and taming what could have been overwhelming.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.600]   MSP, he means multi-scale planning, by the way.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.960]   And weekly templates are helping me grow in specific areas of study.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.900]   Keep up with administrative demands, grow our church and plan family and personal rhythms
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.640]   that are life-giving and make me glad I made the switch five and a half years ago.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.000]   Justin, I appreciate that case study.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.920]   Two things I want to point out.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:06.120]   One, for all the students out there, notice how Justin said he found his undergraduate
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.080]   education to be challenging, but when he returned half a decade later with a little bit more
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.640]   prefrontal cortex and a little bit more systematic approach to his time and efforts, it wasn't
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640]   so hard.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.840]   Being a student is not that hard as long as you don't approach your work like a student.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.240]   When people come back to school later in life, they often have a much easier time doing well
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:34.240]   because it's not that hard of a job if you're good at managing your time and being sort
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.920]   of reasonable about when you get things done.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.480]   So just keep that in mind if you're stressed out as a student.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.600]   I also love the example of lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.880]   He figured out the attributes he was looking for in his life, and some of this had to do
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:50.960]   with who he was around, what he was around in terms of physical features, the mountains,
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.800]   etc., but also some characteristics of his work, in particular that he was open about
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.680]   his faith and that the hours weren't crazy, that he had lots of time with his family.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.200]   Then he worked backwards with opportunities and obstacles and said, "Okay, I could go
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200]   back and get this MA.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.200]   This timing works out.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.040]   If I keep this job over here, that'll pay for that.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.560]   Youth ministry director will help keep the lights on while I'm getting this MA, but it'll
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.680]   have to be the foot in the door to move to a pastor role and set the right type of church,
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.200]   and I throw the right sort of Cal Newport-style organizational strategies at my work.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.240]   I can keep it tamed enough to have the time with my family.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.800]   There's an opportunity to do this near where I want to be."
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.480]   You see how all these pieces fit together.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:36.360]   The final point I want to make here is notice how he was deploying the sort of quote-unquote
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.880]   productivity strategies we talk about, like multiscale planning, weekly templates, and
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.800]   autopilot scheduling.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:48.300]   He was deploying them to help execute his vision of having a job that had a spiritual
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:52.480]   meaning to it but had a reasonable time footprint so he could do other stuff, that he could
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.280]   be present for his family and spend time in nature.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.080]   It's why I get frustrated when people take what we do here, for example, and somehow
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.000]   lump it into some sort of undifferentiated hustle culture.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.660]   When people say talk about organization and productivity is somehow the embodiment of
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:16.220]   some sort of bourgeois embrace of capitalist dynamics, as if there's some better alternative
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:22.520]   world in which we all sit around and do nothing and just snout pithy substacks and are lauded
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.640]   or something like this, and work is all sort of contrived.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.280]   How are people in the real world using these type of ideas?
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.780]   Often they're using them so that they can keep their work contained, the same way I
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.000]   use them.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.680]   I get super stressed with crowded calendars.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.800]   I get super stressed if I have to work outside of a nine to five on any sort of consistent
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   basis.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.520]   I get super stressed if I don't get seasonality, times that are low key to offset times that
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.640]   are higher key.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:52.520]   The only way I know how to sort of keep my work reasonable is to deploy these type of
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.120]   ideas, multi-scale planning, weekly templates, autopilot scheduling.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.960]   I love the shift in thinking.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.280]   You deploy these tools to make your life more sustainable, not as a means to make it more
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280]   stressful.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.280]   What is the reality?
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.840]   Facebook's slow productivity.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:10.800]   Most of the knowledge work sector right now is dominated by this broken notion of pseudo
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.040]   productivity where visible activity is used as a proxy for useful effort.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.960]   So if what you want to do is hustle, what you want to do is keep getting more and keep
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.600]   getting more recognition, you could just work really hard, just work all hours, answer emails
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.700]   all the time, just be visibly busy all the time.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.700]   You don't need.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:31.600]   Why would you need careful planning of your time?
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.860]   Why would you need weekly templates or autopilot schedules or multi-scale planning?
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:39.460]   If you're in the pseudo productivity regime trying to get attention, just be on your email
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.680]   all the time.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.160]   That's what's rewarded right now.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.520]   If anything, the stuff we talk about is sort of counterproductive to the things that get
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:53.880]   people in a superficial sense noticed and moved ahead, especially early in their career.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.840]   So anyways, I use that, Justin, as an excuse for a bit of a rant.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:04.160]   I think of what we call productivity, I think about that if you increase what you can produce
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:11.120]   per unit time, you can now reduce the unit time and keep the production the same and
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.760]   work less.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.560]   That is the flip side to I can increase how much I produce.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.400]   You can also decrease how much you work in a way that is sustainable.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.880]   So we've got two sides of the coin there.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:29.520]   We've got a quick tech corner coming up, but first I want to talk about another sponsor.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.280]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.680]   Every January brings you 365 blank pages waiting to be filled.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:44.720]   2025 is going to have its shares of plot twists coming up above that you're going to have
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   to make your way through.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:51.520]   Grand goals that perhaps dissipate new challenges you weren't expecting.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.660]   But there is one thing you know will make this journey this year better, which is having
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.560]   a good relationship with your own brain.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:04.600]   And if you are struggling with that, for whatever reason, it's anxiety, it's the depressive
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:10.520]   thinking, it's excessive rumination, therapy can help.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.800]   And if you're thinking about introducing therapy in your life, but you don't know where to
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.080]   get started, you're worried about expense, you're worrying about how can I find someone
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.640]   nearby who has like a room in their schedule and how can I fit it to my life?
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:26.280]   The easiest on ramp into the world of therapy is BetterHelp.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.480]   It is fully online, which makes therapy affordable and convenient.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.080]   It currently serves over 5 million people worldwide.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.560]   They do this with a diverse network of more than 30,000 credentialed therapists with a
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.400]   wide range of specialties.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.080]   And when you use BetterHelp, if you don't have a if you're not have a great connection
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:48.640]   with the therapist, you can switch to a different one at any time at no extra cost.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:55.000]   So write your 2025 story and make sure it has a through line of good mental health by
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.360]   using BetterHelp.

[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:09.200]   I also want to talk about my friends at My Body Tutor.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:14.440]   You heard me at the beginning of the show talk about this cool new product done daily
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.400]   where you have a coach that helps you stick to your multiscale plan.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:24.400]   Well, where this all came from is this famous online product, My Body Tutor, T-U-T-O-R.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.320]   They've been at this for 20 years using online coaching to help you become healthier.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.200]   You have an online coach that you work with to help you figure out like what you're doing
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.240]   with your diet, what you're doing with your exercise as this is customized to you.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.080]   And then you check in with the coach every single day.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:45.520]   That is the magic of the My Body Tutor service is accountability.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.600]   The second bit of magic is because you have this coach you're working with, I know you're
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.600]   accountable.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.120]   If you need to adjust, they help you.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.760]   Oh, I'm traveling, you know, for the holidays.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.760]   I'm worried about my diet.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.880]   Like, great, let's come up with a plan.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.200]   I'm going on this corporate retreat.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.600]   I'm not going to have my normal exercise.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.480]   What should I do so I don't sort of lose momentum?
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.480]   They'll help you come up with a plan.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.320]   So you can adjust the things and then you have the accountability.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.080]   That really is the most effective way I know of to get healthy short of actually having
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.620]   a nutritionist and physical trainer come to your house like the Hollywood stars do.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.440]   But that costs all the dollars in the world.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:22.100]   My Body Tutor, because it's delivered online, you get that same sort of concierge daily
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.260]   service, but you get it at a much more affordable price.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.600]   So go to My Body Tutor, T-U-T-O-R to learn more.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.600]   If you mention you came from the Deep Questions podcast, they will give you $50 off your first
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   month.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.320]   So go to BodyTutor.com and mention Deep Questions.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:40.040]   All right, Jesse, let's do our last segment.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.680]   So we're going to do a Tech Corners where we talk about some sort of interesting element
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.640]   or idea from the world of technology.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:53.680]   Today I want to talk about what I'm going to conservatively assess to be the most important
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.880]   article of the last decade.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.160]   You say that's fair, Jesse?
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160]   Most important article.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   I haven't read it yet, though.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.440]   Well, you know.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440]   I think we know.
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440]   It's the most important.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.360]   What I've got is my latest article for the New Yorker.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.720]   I've loaded this up on the screen here for those who are watching.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:16.600]   The article is called A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:26.560]   So here's the point of this article is I spent time with two DIY maker YouTube YouTubers.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:32.120]   So the people who build, they build sort of crazy contraptions on YouTube.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.720]   One of them was James Hobson, who runs a channel called The Hacksmith, and they do a lot of
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:41.240]   like taking things from Marvel movies and then building real life versions of them.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.320]   Wolverine's Claws or Captain American Shield, or they built the bulletproof suit from the
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.820]   John Wick movies.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:50.800]   And then I also looked at Colin Furze, who also builds crazy things.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.520]   Right now his current project is he's digging out a secret underground garage in front of
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.560]   his otherwise nondescript suburban England house, and it's going to have a DeLorean.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.540]   It'll be a button he presses that summons this DeLorean from underground and the front
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.120]   yard opens and it's going to come out.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.760]   He's working on that right now.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.360]   So I spent time with both of them.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.000]   I recommend you read the article if you have a New Yorker subscription.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.520]   But here's like the point from the article that I want to emphasize here.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:21.800]   They started the same way, both James and Colin, right?
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.280]   Early YouTube, they got started, they started doing these type of videos, they built up
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.360]   an audience, found sponsors, suddenly they could do this full time.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.960]   Then their paths diverged, creating an interesting natural experiment.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.120]   James decided, "I want to get big."
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:39.200]   Now it turns out like what he was really motivated by here is he just loved the idea of having
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.880]   a giant space with all these people.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.200]   He just had this, "I want to get big."
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.320]   So he began aggressively investing money in the channel.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.880]   He went from his garage to a 13,000 square foot warehouse that they were leasing, and
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.840]   then he took out a multi-million dollar mortgage to go to like an 18,000 square foot warehouse
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.400]   on this large corporate campus, and they remodeled the whole thing.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.840]   It's called the Hacksmith something, like Research Center, HERC, and he modeled it after
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:16.160]   Stark Industries from Iron Man, 30 employees, a burn rate of a quarter million dollars a
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.160]   month.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.640]   He really blew this thing out big.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.080]   Colin Furze did none of that.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.160]   He just filmed some edits to videos on his own.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.520]   James's wife like holds the camera for him, just like does it on his own.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:30.800]   He has a barn that's not air-conditioned, which horrifies James.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.960]   He's like, "Why aren't you air-conditioning your barn?"
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.280]   And Colin's like, "Eh, whatever.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280]   It's too hot.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280]   I'll just work in my garage.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.340]   It's fine."
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.520]   I went through, so I tell you two stories.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520]   You go through.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.720]   They're making the same type of videos.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.880]   Colin's channel's doing just as well.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.960]   Actually, it did more views than James's channel did in 2024, and so I get into why in this
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.080]   article, and the short summary is that I point out that there is a specific type of media
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:01.360]   that's happening in some online spaces, parts of YouTube, in podcasting, in sub-stack newsletters,
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:07.600]   where the typical dictum that you should just keep growing doesn't necessarily apply, and
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.800]   that there's a sweet spot where trying to grow bigger you're not going to.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.800]   There's an authentic sweet spot where you can make a very good living for yourself.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.880]   I'm talking probably like doctor or lawyer money.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.280]   You're not Elon Musk, but you're making more money than a computer programmer.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.000]   There's this sweet spot you can get into in podcasting, in sub-stack, and in certain corners
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.920]   of YouTube where it's low overhead, you do really well, but you don't have a lot of other
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.640]   people you're paying, and actually, it's not easy to break out of it.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:41.040]   I get into why James's approach to scale didn't work and why these type of media are resistant
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.680]   to throwing in a lot of money and scaling really big.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.680]   The conclusion is this is like a cool reality of the current internet.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.080]   It's a good counterpoint, I think, to sort of consolidated social media culture where
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:55.120]   everyone is just a digital sharecropper for a small number of big companies and just creating
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:59.500]   free content so they can make a lot of money so that Mark Zuckerberg can buy bigger chains.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:04.760]   It's like a counterpoint to all of that where you can have a non-trivial size creative middle
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:11.940]   class of people who make a really good living creating interesting stuff, and it's not part
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:15.600]   of a massive company, and it's not a winner take all, only six of these people exist in
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.600]   the end.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.360]   So as I get into the details in this article, but the creative middle class is something
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.000]   I've been following, and I think as social media's cultural grip has begun to become
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.160]   more shaky in the last few years, the opportunities for this creative middle class, these genres
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.080]   that can support a large number of people doing well, not starting massive companies,
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.880]   but individually doing well, the opportunities for this is growing, and it's a trend to follow.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.680]   I think it's a very positive trend for the internet, and it's a very positive trend to
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.360]   follow for just the state of the creative arts in general.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:47.800]   So anyways, check out this article.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.840]   I'm actually writing like four articles in a row for The New Yorker.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.360]   I'm sort of taking over Kyle Chakra's column for a month.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.560]   So we'll have more to talk about.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.800]   I'm writing one about TikTok right now, so I'm kind of doing a bunch of tech thinking
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.800]   right now.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.600]   But anyways, check out this article if you have a New Yorker subscription because it
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.240]   illustrates a cool point that I think is worth keeping track of.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.920]   All right, well, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:10.920]   Thank you for listening.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:17.480]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show and until then, as always, stay
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   deep.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.540]   Hey, if you enjoyed today's discussion, you might also enjoy episode 333.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:27.840]   It's called New Year's Course Correction, and it gives some small things you can do
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.840]   right now.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.680]   It'll have a big positive difference on the year ahead.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.960]   I think you'll like it.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   Check it out.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.800]   It'll have four simple ideas.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:44.700]   We can call them mid-year course corrections that are all designed to do two things.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:49.640]   One, help you reclaim some depth in areas where our currently distracted world might
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.800]   be robbing that depth, and two, be something that you can execute right away.
