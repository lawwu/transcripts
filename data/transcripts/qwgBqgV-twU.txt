[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   - Pastor John, in episode number 468,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   you talk briefly about ISIS
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.800]   and the terrorism in the Middle East.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.200]   On this subject, it raises the question for us
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.040]   over whether or not Christian adults
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.160]   should watch the gruesome ISIS beheading videos online,
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.280]   or even look at the gruesome pictures of ISIS evil.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.440]   Should we or not?
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.240]   How do you think through this question?
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.800]   - It seems to me, Tony, that there are reasons
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.800]   why it might serve a person to watch such a thing,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.840]   and there are reasons why it might not.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.720]   And maybe what would be helpful is if I mention
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.480]   a few of those reasons, and people then can decide
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.640]   which group they're in.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.280]   Will it serve them or will it not serve them?
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.800]   Will it help them love people and love God to watch this,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.720]   or will it not?
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.280]   And of course, that does imply,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.920]   I don't think there's anything intrinsically wrong
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560]   with seeing this horror.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.440]   I don't think seeing horror is necessarily sharing
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.160]   in the sin of the horror.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   So first, why or how might it be helpful to see it?
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.080]   And I'll start with a personal example.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.760]   In June of 2004, I went back to check this.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.160]   Paul Johnson, an American helicopter mechanic
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.320]   in Saudi Arabia, was kidnapped by al-Qaeda,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.960]   and they threatened to kill him
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.400]   if prisoners weren't released.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.280]   And of course, the prisoners were not released,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.120]   and they killed him.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.160]   And they put the video and the pictures
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.120]   of his beheading online.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120]   Now, that was the very first time in my life
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   I had ever had the occasion to even think
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   about looking at such a thing, and I did.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.800]   I did.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.720]   They found his head a month later in a refrigerator in Riyadh.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   I went to the news site, and I found the picture.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.040]   I have it, and here's the weird thing.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.120]   I copied it.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.960]   It is in my iPhoto.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   So I looked at it again to get ready for this.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.760]   His head is sitting on his back.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.520]   I mean, I just thought of his wife or his kids,
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.680]   just the horror of such a thing.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.960]   So, "Piper, what are you doing?
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.400]   Are you sick?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.880]   Why did you even go there?
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.960]   And why, for goodness sakes, did you save it?"
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   And here's what's going on in my head.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.840]   I thought to myself, "We in the modern West
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.760]   are often so insulated from real, horrible, physical
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.120]   suffering and death.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.040]   We have 911 and emergency rooms and antibiotics and morphine,
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280]   and they've put us so out of touch
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.000]   with the kind of suffering and death
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.160]   that much of the world deals with constantly.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480]   We can hardly feel what it's like to really risk our lives
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.440]   or confront the most dangerous and horrible kinds of evil
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.520]   head on."
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   And so it seemed to me that I needed,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.520]   John Piper in 2004 needed to be confronted face
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.640]   to face with this kind of horror, this kind of evil.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   I needed to feel some of the revulsion or horror
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   that many people around the world
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.960]   have to face daily, including Christians,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   and sometimes because they're Christians.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.040]   And the biblical basis, I gave it some thought
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.800]   those years ago.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.000]   Are you getting a biblical basis for this kind of thinking?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.800]   And what I thought of in those days and reflected on again
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.640]   was Hebrews 11:37 that says, "They were stoned.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.280]   They were sawn in two."
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.920]   Think of it.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.080]   They were sawn in two, probably alive,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.560]   with one of those big two-man logging saw type deals.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.600]   They were sawn in two.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.040]   They were killed with a sword.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.640]   They went about in skins and sheep and goats,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.800]   destitute, afflicted, mistreated.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.240]   And that last word, mistreated, it's not a light word,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.560]   like a slap on the cheek.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.440]   It's a horrible word, and it's used one more time
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.240]   in the New Testament, namely chapter 13 of Hebrews,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.520]   verse 3, where it says, "Remember those in prison
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.040]   as though in prison with them and those who are mistreated."
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.280]   These are like people who are being sawn in two.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.000]   Those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.720]   And I don't think that means in the church.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.920]   I think that means you have a body.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.760]   They have a body.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.480]   You have a body.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.360]   They're being slaughtered.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.160]   You have a body.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.560]   Can you imagine what it's like for them to be slaughtered?
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.440]   I think that's the gist of this text, getting inside their skins
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   and sharing.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.800]   And so I thought, I have a body.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.240]   I need to feel a little bit of what
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.880]   it would be like to have a knife at my throat with somebody
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.920]   saying, will you renounce Christ?
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.360]   So I think it may be good for some of us
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.240]   who feel a bit cloistered and sanitized and distant
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.920]   from the horrors of the world, whether murders in our cities
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.280]   right here or terrorism around the globe,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.720]   to have a little bit of exposure to this horror
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   so that we're not naive and at least not as naive.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.680]   Maybe we can't really prepare ourselves
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.760]   for what that would be like, but it sure is good to try, I think.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.920]   So the day is going to come.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.640]   If I read the book of Revelation rightly,
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.920]   the day is going to come when such horrors will be more
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.400]   common and more close to home.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.320]   And if we've not come to terms with them theologically
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   and emotionally, our faith may collapse when face to face,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.880]   we see this horror.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.280]   I mean, I can imagine a lot of Christians
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.480]   whose theology is so weak when it comes to God's sovereignty
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.320]   and suffering in sovereignty, that when they see something
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.600]   like that, they just become emotionally unglued.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.520]   They are totally undone and throw away their faith
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.200]   in a good and sovereign God.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.320]   But I said there were reasons both ways.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.960]   On the other hand, it's not a duty.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   I don't mean to put anybody under any kind of pressure
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.480]   to do this.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.640]   There's no biblical mandate to look at a horrible picture
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.160]   or to see horror.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.440]   And we need to know ourselves.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.840]   If it's going to give you nightmares,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.440]   if it's going to otherwise decrease your ability
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.880]   to function in a loving way, then don't by any means
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.720]   look at it.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.880]   So that's the criterion in the end.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.520]   Will looking at such a thing increase
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.200]   your emotional capacities to do good to others,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.640]   or will it decrease them?
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.120]   And we have talked about this more in the past.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.160]   In the episode we titled "Facing Death Faithfully,"
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.880]   that was episode number 91 in the archive.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.960]   It's valuable content to check out.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.600]   We return on Monday with a more happy theme.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   And we'll hear from a listener in Dubai
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.840]   who is wondering whether or not her wedding needs
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.160]   to be conducted in a church.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   Have a great weekend.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
