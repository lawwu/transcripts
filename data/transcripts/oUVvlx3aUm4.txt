[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.120]   All right, let's do one more question here.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.840]   I have one from Matt.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   Matt says, in college, I had a couple influential role models
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.280]   tell me to follow my passion.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.200]   This led me to get my bachelor's in cultural anthropology.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.480]   Now I'm in a PhD program.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.800]   Only after I started my PhD did I read your book,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560]   So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.600]   And I became convinced of your philosophy
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.760]   of acquiring career capital rather than
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.400]   following a pre-existing passion to attain career fulfillment.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   Now I've committed to a path based on a philosophy
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.960]   that I no longer believe in.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.520]   How would you adjust the advice that you
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.100]   give in So Good They Can't Ignore You
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.640]   for people who have already committed
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.840]   to a passion-based path and now see it as a sunk cost?
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.880]   Well, Matt, there's no adjustment you need to do,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   because here is the reality of my advice.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.920]   I say, when it comes to figuring out what path you set down,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.840]   you can lower the bar.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.160]   There's lots of paths that you can transform
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.760]   into a life, a professional life, that's
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.440]   a real source of passion and fulfillment.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.760]   So what really is going to matter
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   is once you fix one path, for whatever reason
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160]   you chose that path, is what you do
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   once you chose it, which is focus
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.240]   on building rare and valuable skills,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.800]   use the career capital that generates
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.600]   to take control of your career, move it
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.440]   towards things that resonate and away from things that don't.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   Have a clear lifestyle in mind that you use
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.160]   to help guide these decisions.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.120]   So the key to that philosophy is,
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.960]   I don't care that much how you chose your current path.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.720]   So the fact that you chose your current path because you
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.880]   were using passion philosophy, that's fine.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.200]   If you thought, described this as a passion,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.480]   that means it's something that was interesting to you,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.720]   that probably had interesting opportunities associated
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.600]   with it, and that you had some sort of inclination for.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.100]   So great.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.560]   That's a perfectly good reason to choose a path.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.840]   So the idea is not, let's be really clear about this,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.960]   that if you follow your passion, that that will
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.600]   lead you to a bad career.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.080]   That's not true.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.400]   The issue I have is if your only strategy
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.280]   for getting to a good career is matching a job to a passion,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.080]   and then sitting back and saying, my work here is done,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.240]   I should love this now.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.200]   I'm saying, no, no, no, your work is just beginning.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.580]   So I don't care much about how you chose your career.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.860]   You chose it because you thought it was your passion, great.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.300]   Good way to do it.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.660]   What matters is what you do next.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.100]   And what you do next is you focus with deliberate practice
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   on becoming so good you can't be ignored.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.500]   Take the career capital that earns you to have leverage
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.100]   over your career.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.120]   This is where you're going to need courage, not in choosing
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.660]   what to do, but choosing to change
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.200]   what you do to be different than what other people are doing.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.220]   This is where you step back and say,
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.660]   I'm going to not take a professorship,
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.240]   or I'm going to be a professorship at this school
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.960]   and still write books, or I'm going to do my own thing,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.660]   or whatever it is.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.860]   But you're investing your career capital
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.940]   to create a career that pushes towards things that resonate
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.280]   and away from things that don't.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.400]   And again, the way you hone those instincts of residence
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.520]   and anti-residence is lifestyle-centered career
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.320]   planning.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.520]   Fix in your head a really clear image
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.080]   of what your life is like, where you live, what you do,
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.240]   who you're with, what your time is like, how you feel.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.680]   Fix an image you can taste, that you
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.200]   can smell, that just touches something right in you.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.280]   And let that be your guide to figuring out,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.500]   I want to go more towards this in my career
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.480]   or more towards that.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.640]   And the thing that allows you to make those choices
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.720]   is career capital.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.000]   It is being good at things that are rare and valuable.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.700]   So Matt, you're in a great position.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.440]   You've already chosen a good path.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.120]   It's a good match for you.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.240]   Now let's focus on actually navigating that path
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.080]   as effectively as possible.
