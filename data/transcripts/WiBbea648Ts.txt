[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Well, what are the angels up to today?
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.520]   It's a great question.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.880]   It comes to us from an anonymous listener of the podcast.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.160]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.240]   Can you tell me, what is the role of angels right now?
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.600]   What are they doing?
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320]   And as Christians, what active role do they play in our lives today?
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.000]   Pastor John, how would you address this?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.720]   I think it's helpful to pose the question like this.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.600]   Why do angels exist?
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.240]   That will include, what do they do?
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.760]   How do they relate to us?
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.600]   And we can answer those questions, at least in part, by looking at what they do in the
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.160]   Bible, which is the safest place to start, I think.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.640]   But it also inclines us to ask, what is God up to by creating agents for his activity
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.600]   when he himself could do the very thing that they do just fine by himself?
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.280]   All the things that the Bible says angels do, God could snap his finger, so to speak,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.680]   and it would be done.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.200]   God doesn't need angels in order to accomplish things.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.480]   So that's why I ask, why do they exist in the first place?
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.520]   And why so many of them as we will see?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.800]   So let's start at the safest place to start, namely with the Bible, instead of our own
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800]   speculations.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.040]   And here's some of the things that the Bible says angels are doing.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.240]   And the term angel or angels occurs in the Bible close to 300 times.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.620]   So this is not a marginal reality in Scripture.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.760]   So here's a sample.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.880]   Angels announced things about the birth of Jesus to Mary, Elizabeth, Joseph, Zechariah,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.280]   the shepherds.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.320]   They ministered to Jesus in the wilderness after his 40-day fast.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.080]   They rolled the stone away from Jesus' grave.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   They opened prison doors for the apostles.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.640]   They directed evangelists where to go, like Philip.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.620]   They spoke to unbelievers like Cornelius about what they should do to find the gospel.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.000]   They will come with Jesus, the Bible says, at his second coming.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.520]   That's just a sampling of their activity in the Bible, particularly from the New Testament.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   And they are mentioned, by the way, in the Old Testament over a hundred times.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.680]   But let's get more specific with four texts that give us glimpses of what angels do and
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320]   why they exist.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.640]   So here's the first one.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   One of the most basic texts there are about angels and Christians, Hebrews 1, 13 and 14.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.640]   Almost the whole first chapter of Hebrews is devoted to showing the superiority of Jesus
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.720]   over angels.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.760]   The chapter ends like this.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:22.000]   Are they not all, that is angels, are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.760]   for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.680]   Several things are remarkable about that statement.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.120]   It says that angels exist for the sake of Christians, those who are to inherit salvation.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   It says that they are serving us as ministering spirits.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.900]   And maybe most amazingly, it says that all of them, not just some, all of them serve
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.480]   Christians to help us make it home to inherit our salvation.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.520]   So all angels serve the good of all Christians all the time.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.360]   They are agents, as it were, of Romans 8, 28, making everything work together for good
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.920]   under God's providence.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.000]   Here's the second sweeping text about angels.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.480]   Psalm 103, verse 20.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.520]   "Blessed the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   his word.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.360]   Blessed the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers who do his will."
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.880]   So it says angels are mighty ones.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.040]   They're not baby-like, chubby cherubs with wings.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.600]   They are colossal and tremendous in power.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.120]   And then the psalmist calls them armies.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.200]   The English word "hosts" translates a Hebrew word that means army or troops or military
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.120]   forces.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.620]   But whether you call them angels or you call them hosts or armies, the emphasis in both
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.800]   cases in Psalm 103 falls on this.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.160]   They do the will of God.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.200]   You mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word, his hosts, his ministers
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.280]   who do his will.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.540]   In other words, they are active, they are agents who do whatever God commands.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:39.920]   So it seems to me that we can infer from this that God loves to create an abundance of doers
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.160]   of his will at multiple levels.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.600]   Inanimate objects do his will.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.680]   He commands the sea and it obeys him.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   Animals do his will.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.240]   He commands a whale to swallow Jonah.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.880]   Humans do his will.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   Angels do his will.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.920]   And when God decided to create, he thought it wise to create hierarchies of beings, it
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.480]   seems like, from the least significant inanimate stone to the worm to the whale to the human
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.360]   and then to multiple ranks of angels, because some are called archangels.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.840]   First Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16, not just angels, but ranks of angels.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.040]   And when they become demonic by rebellion, there are ranks of principalities and powers
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.160]   in the hordes of the devil.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:39.080]   Here's a third text that underlines God's exuberance in creating angels.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:47.760]   Daniel chapter 7 verse 10, "A stream of fire issued and came out from before the Lord.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   A thousand thousands served him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.280]   The court sat in judgment and the books were opened."
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.480]   That's the end of the quote from Daniel 7.10.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   So there's a picture of God in heaven with 100 million angels standing before him.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.280]   Now that's breathtaking.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.760]   That's the point.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:32.520]   God created millions upon millions of angels as a fitting, regal, royal assembly for his
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   magnificence.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:43.800]   The vastness of such a crowd of colossal beings all assembled before one great king speaks
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:52.880]   in a unique way about the glory and the imperial majesty of the King of Kings.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:01.980]   So angels exist in their grandeur and in their obedience and in their vast numbers to call
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.720]   attention to the greatness of the God they serve.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.760]   Here's one last text that's perhaps the most unusual of all.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.640]   Matthew 8 verse 10, "See that you do not despise one of these little ones.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:29.920]   For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father."
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.120]   This is Jesus talking, who is in heaven.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   Say it again.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.760]   "See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.300]   For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.780]   heaven."
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.800]   What in the world did Jesus mean by that?
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:58.900]   Well, the little ones refer to believers, Christians, childlike Christians, real Christians
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.880]   who are easily despised and made fun of in this world.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.860]   And I think what he's saying is this.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:16.500]   Every Christian, even the simplest, lowliest believer has an entourage of titans, angels,
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:24.360]   colossal, glorious beings who stand in the most privileged position in the universe before
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.820]   the face of God.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:35.680]   Everyone's ready to do God's bidding at any time on behalf of those despised little Christians.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:44.260]   So be careful not to despise any simple, unimpressive follower of Jesus.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:52.320]   Heavenly titans are in God's service on their behalf in the very place of privilege before
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   his face.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.520]   Now, I wrote an article at Desiring God called "The Surprising Role of Guardian Angels"
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.160]   where I give all the arguments for what I just said.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:09.760]   If it sounds like a new and unusual take on that text or on guardian angels, I hope you'll
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.000]   go to Desiring God and just search on that "Surprising Role of Guardian Angels."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.200]   So let me just sum it up again like this.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.080]   Jesus says, "See that you do not despise one of these little ones, one of my believers,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.800]   because"—now here's the reason you must not despise any Christian—"because I tell
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   you in heaven, they're angels."
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.600]   This is not one angel for one person.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.200]   There's nothing in the text that would suggest that.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.240]   "They're angels.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.160]   Always see the face of my Father."
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.520]   Don't despise this simple, unimpressive disciple of Jesus.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.280]   Let his angelic entourage remind you whose son he is.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.080]   Let this angelic entourage of titans remind you whose Lord he is.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:05.360]   Put your hand over your critical, despising mouth and show great esteem for all ordinary
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.800]   childlike disciples.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.680]   If the fact that God is their Father and Jesus is their Lord doesn't keep you back from
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.080]   despising and mistreating the followers of Jesus, then let this terrifying advocacy and
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.440]   rank of their magnificent angels awaken you from your stupor.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.520]   That's the idea.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:35.040]   So in heaven and on earth, angels in their magnificence serve to call attention to the
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:44.240]   grandeur of God and surprisingly serve to call attention to the lesser but breathtaking
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.600]   grandeur of the simplest believer.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:57.960]   God intends for the role of angels to thrill us with his grace and power and wisdom in
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:05.760]   the way he created, the way he governs, and the way he is saving his people.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.240]   Fascinating survey of why angels exist.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for cramming all of that into one episode.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It's a lot of content.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.600]   And thank you for listening today.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.080]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.560]   You can search through or browse all 1,600 of our past episodes, or you can subscribe
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   to the podcast.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.400]   You can do all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   Well is there something stopping you from coming to Christ?
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.280]   This is actually a common issue.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.520]   I would not be surprised if some of you listening right now are facing this too.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.480]   Something gets in the way of the gospel.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.680]   Often it's a moralism.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.720]   Sinners who know that they are sinners, who really want to come to Christ, wrongly assume
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.360]   that they must first clean themselves up in order to make themselves worthy of Christ.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.680]   This is a huge mistake.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.400]   Millions of people are living in this mistake right now.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   And Pastor John will explain why and how to escape it next time.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.600]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.320]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.640]   See you then.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   [END]
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   1.
