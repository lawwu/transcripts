[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   Well, over the centuries, we've seen some amazing positive changes in our nation and
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.360]   around the world, plunging infant mortality rates, improved health, lengthening lifespans.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.320]   And we've seen the abolishment of some of the most inhumane practices on the planet.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.960]   Of course, this world remains a fallen, hostile place.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.320]   But what role does God play when we see these types of positive social changes taking place?
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.240]   It's a question to you, Pastor John, from a listener named Jim. Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.920]   When something huge and good happens in a society, like a faulty government system is
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.780]   fixed or slavery is abolished or minorities are given more equal treatment or anything
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.560]   of the like, is God secretly at work in that moment, inspiring things to happen?
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.960]   What is God's role in positive social changes?
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:57.560]   Well, first, let's be sure that we have a distinctively Christian view of the term positive
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.240]   social change.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.100]   Whenever we're talking about change among unbelievers, the term positive must always
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.840]   be qualified in our mind so that we don't stop thinking like Christians and simply think
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.120]   like unbelievers.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:24.440]   Christians know that all so-called positive deeds done from a heart of unbelief or disregard
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.000]   for the glory of God or disregard for the eternal good of people or disregard for reliance
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   upon the mercies of God in Christ, those deeds, no matter how beneficial they are in the short
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.960]   run for our prosperity or health or freedom, still are acts of rebellion against God and
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.000]   so not positive in the ultimate sense.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   So I'm assuming that when Jim asks about God's role in positive social change, he means change
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.760]   for the short-term benefits of people like rising material standards of living and greater
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:20.520]   health and more safety and more freedom to act out our convictions, even if the short-term
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.480]   benefits for society are not accompanied by spiritual awakening or faith in Jesus.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.320]   So that's the question I'm asking.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.120]   What's the role of God in those kinds of societal changes?
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.880]   That's what I assume he's asking.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   Now I've got a general answer, but before I give a general answer, let me point directly
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.160]   to some biblical signals that will, I think, let Jim answer the question for himself, which
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.040]   is really what I'd prefer that we all just see it in the Bible instead of me saying it.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.160]   So number one, these are all signals from the scripture, pointers from the scripture.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.260]   Proverbs 21.1, "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.800]   He turns it wherever he will."
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.400]   So the biblical picture is that the will of a secular king is in the hand of God.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.480]   So if that king wills to treat his subjects better and make their life more prosperous,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.640]   God is behind that, Proverbs 21.1 says.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.520]   Number two, this is a specific example of Proverbs 21.1.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.480]   "Then God said to Abimelech," this is Genesis 20, verse six, "God said to Abimelech in the
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.120]   dream, 'It was I who kept you from sinning against me.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.600]   Therefore I did not let you touch her.'"
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.680]   Namely, Abraham's wife, Sarah.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.640]   So I take it that whenever a secular ruler is restrained in some evil he might do that
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.560]   would hurt his people, God is ultimately behind that restraint.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.600]   So God has power to restrain Abimelech from committing adultery, and he can restrain any
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.160]   king from doing anything he doesn't want them to do.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.640]   Third, another example of Proverbs 21.1 is when God changes the hearts of the kings of
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:35.080]   Persia so that they treat the nation of Israel better than they ever dreamed anybody dreamed
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.560]   they would after the Babylonian exile.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.400]   "God has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia to grant us some
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.480]   reviving to set up the house of God to repair its ruins," et cetera, Ezra 9.9.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:59.440]   So even the pagan Babylonian and then Persian kings were moved by God to treat his people
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.320]   in a better way than would have otherwise happened.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   Here's number four.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.680]   And this one I love.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:13.760]   It's just so amazing that God uses his secret providence over the entire secular, global,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.480]   governmental world in Jesus' day to bring about the birth of Jesus in the appointed
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480]   place in Bethlehem.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:33.120]   I mean, isn't it amazing that God prophesied in Micah that the child, the Messiah is going
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.240]   to be born in Bethlehem.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.360]   And then he chooses a virgin girl who lives in Nazareth to bear his son.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.160]   And how does he get her to Bethlehem?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.840]   In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.080]   Just think of it.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.000]   God chooses a virgin in Nazareth to bear a son in Bethlehem and to get him to Bethlehem,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.480]   he makes sure that she's engaged to a man whose birthright is in Bethlehem.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.560]   And then he causes Caesar way off in Rome to change his policies so that in just the
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.640]   nick of time, there's this decree that goes out so that the prophecy is fulfilled in Bethlehem.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.600]   My goodness, if you ever needed any evidence that the secular rulers are in the hand of
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   God to bring about God's good purposes for his people, that would be it.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   Here's another one.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.320]   Psalm 47, 9.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.680]   These are moving towards the general conclusion.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.720]   The shields of the Lord belong to God.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.520]   He is highly exalted, which I take to mean that all the military might of the world is
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.200]   ultimately in the hands of God.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.160]   So if any military is ever used to protect any people and keep them from having murderous
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.260]   invaders, then that is also from God.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.500]   And the last pointer or signal I would mention is Ephesians 1.11.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.880]   God works all things according to the counsel of his will.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.360]   Ephesians 1.11.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:15.280]   So my conclusion in answer to Jim's question, what is God's role in positive social change,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.360]   is that his role is that he's always involved.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.660]   He's always ultimate.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:27.800]   He's always ultimate and decisive, which of course means, as anyone would immediately
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:36.680]   infer that he's also ultimate and decisive over the so-called negative social changes
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.440]   as well.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:47.360]   God rules all things either by his positive agency, or more or less directly causing things,
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:56.280]   or by permission, which is equally wise and equally purposeful, since God knows what anybody's
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.800]   going to do, that he permits to do evil things.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   Here's one practical upshot of all this, among a thousand others, I'm sure, is that Paul
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.600]   teaches us in 1 Timothy 2, 1-4 to pray.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.680]   He says, "Pray for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead a peaceful
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:26.080]   and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way that is good and is pleasing in the sight
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.280]   of God, who desires all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth."
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.960]   I think the implication of that is that since God is sovereign, he is able to answer the
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:45.000]   prayers of his people, that rulers would be led, sometimes even in spite of themselves,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.480]   led in the use of their authority to make decisions that would open doors for the gospel
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.000]   and advance godliness in the world.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Amen.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.760]   God's absolute sovereignty is incredibly practical and motivational to our behaviors
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   and to our obedience.
