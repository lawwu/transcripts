[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   one of the most underrated things that I've been playing around with for the last year or so is
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.360]   expiry. Everything expires in this world except digital stuff and the whole idea that digital
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.160]   information doesn't really expire can be a great thing but in some cases it also just does not
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.480]   allow us to let go of things and so I've been playing around with expiry. I have this notion
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.000]   template which basically for all the things that are kind of these nice to haves but not need to
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.760]   haves, I throw them in there and then if I don't get to them over a period of time, it's basically
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.120]   if I don't check it as done or delete it, it'll automatically expire after a certain period that
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.600]   I can set and that's actually really nice because again I'm not throwing anything mission critical in
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   here but I am throwing those things where it's like oh let me get to this and ultimately if I
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.680]   haven't gotten to it in let's say 30 days instead of having this wait that like sticks with me
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.280]   forever that just gets longer and longer and longer, this allows me to just process it.
