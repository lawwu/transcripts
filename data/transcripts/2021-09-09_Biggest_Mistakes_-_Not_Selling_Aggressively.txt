[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.400]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   I'm your host.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.420]   Today on the show, I'm going to share with you one of the biggest financial mistakes
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.920]   that I have made as part of this overall series.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640]   I've got over half a dozen on my personal notes.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.380]   I'm not sure that I'll share with you all of them, but I will choose some of them to
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.380]   share with you.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.420]   I want to share one that's just simply timely because it actually came from a recent listener.
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.580]   The mistake is simply this.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.440]   One of the biggest financial mistakes that I have made is not selling aggressively enough.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.680]   Not aggressively selling and marketing myself, my products and services, others' products
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.420]   and services.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.480]   The impetus for today's show came, I was recently communicating with a listener of the show
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.080]   and he was saying, "Joshua, one of the things I really appreciate about you is that you
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.000]   have been successful without engaging in heavy marketing.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720]   You haven't ever given yourself over to a lot of marketing.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.280]   I really appreciate that."
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.740]   I responded back and I said, "Well, thank you that you appreciate it, but I consider
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.440]   that one of the biggest mistakes.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.560]   It's a mistake that I regret making and it's a mistake that I don't intend to make in the
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.360]   future."
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.800]   While that may surprise you, I want to share with you because if that one listener thinks
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.760]   that perhaps you yourself might think that this is the case.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.840]   I do not think that the way that I have done things is the way that I should have done
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.080]   things.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.520]   I do not intend that the way that I have done things in the past is the way that I will
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.920]   do things in the future.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.320]   Let me share with you some background, some background ideas, and let me share with you
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.480]   some analysis on this subject, on the topic of selling aggressively, on the topic of should
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.680]   you focus on selling aggressively.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.400]   Because this is kind of a slippery argument to talk about and we often do appreciate things
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   on multiple sides of the issue.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   Let me begin with my background and my story.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.020]   First, if we went all the way back to my childhood, I was not raised in an environment in which
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.360]   I was taught to focus on money.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.320]   I didn't come from a wealthy family.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.480]   My parents were ordinary, hardworking, virtuous, middle-class people.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.000]   They were strong, devout Christians, and so because of that, never in their lives would
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.200]   they ever have imagined putting money as their number one priority.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.580]   They of course did value thrift, frugality, stewardship of resources, but they never would
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.660]   have made a decision where money was the number one thing.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.420]   Never in my life have I ever seen my mom or my dad say, "Oh, look, money.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.060]   I'm going to prioritize money over something else."
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.100]   If there was ever a list of things that had to be prioritized, if my dad was going to
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.820]   prioritize a relationship, if he had to choose between a relationship or making more money,
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.700]   he would choose the relationship every time.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.900]   If my mom was going to choose between helping somebody and having more money, she would
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.820]   help somebody every time.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.860]   My parents modeled for me an example of selfless sacrifice, pouring out their lives for others
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340]   through their entire lifetime.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.460]   Every bit of everything I have ever seen has been, I have observed my parents being generous
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.820]   to others, helping others, sharing with others, serving others, loving others, completely
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.060]   selflessly with no expectation of gain or return.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.460]   And so I wasn't raised in an environment where money was the primary thing.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.020]   I would say in addition to that, in and among Christian circles, the pursuit of money and
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.740]   the pursuit of wealth is often an uncomfortable subject for people to talk about.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.660]   First, this is simply due to the reality of the various statements that exist in the Christian
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.860]   Bible and in Christian doctrine.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.500]   You have many seemingly paradoxical statements related to money.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.180]   You can pick up the Bible and depending on which particular statements you choose to
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.860]   emphasize, you can use those biblical statements to justify really almost any position that
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.980]   you want to justify.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.420]   From everything from God's going to bless you and make you a multimillionaire if you'll
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.620]   just serve him and love him.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.620]   It's all up to you.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.460]   God helps those who help themselves.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.580]   You shouldn't have any money.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.340]   You shouldn't accumulate any kind of wealth.
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.260]   You should give it all away and go follow Jesus.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.220]   You can, depending on which particular statements you want to emphasize, you can support all
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.640]   of those with scripture right there in black, white, and red.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.180]   And so there's a good deal of discomfort in many Christian circles of talking about money
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.020]   because of these paradoxes.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.820]   In general though, virtually all branches of the Christian religion are united in the
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:16.460]   fact that they don't believe that the pursuit of money should be the primary goal of life.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:25.660]   You'll virtually never hear a knowledgeable Christian say, "Your number one primary goal
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.500]   of life should be to accumulate money."
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:36.020]   There's just simply overwhelming indications, overwhelming scriptural prohibition against
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.260]   that and an encouragement to focus on those things that are less ephemeral than great
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.260]   wealth.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.500]   And so because of that, I was raised in that kind of culture.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.820]   And since I adopted consciously and intentionally that worldview for myself, I have never been
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.060]   one who has prioritized money over any other particular thing.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.960]   I've never been one who says, "My number one goal in life is to become rich."
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.400]   In addition, due to the influences that I came to appreciate, the consultants and the
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.860]   people that I sought after their advice, I always came to appreciate things like experiences
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.860]   over stuff.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.020]   This is commonplace now.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.580]   It was not perhaps in decades past, but today it's now commonplace that most people will
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.020]   say, "Oh, don't accumulate stuff, but accumulate experiences instead."
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.320]   I also have often gained inspiration from people who live well on little.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.480]   I've always admired those who show, "Look, I can live a lifestyle that works really well
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.000]   on just a little bit of money."
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.880]   And so I came to think myself that, "You know what?
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.280]   I don't need a lot of money.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.360]   I don't need a lot of money.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.840]   I can do well on less, and I'll focus on my passions and my interests and the experiences."
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.380]   Now, furthermore, my own journey through selling, especially in the context of something like
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.520]   radical personal finance, was made more difficult due to my background and the general suspicion
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:13.060]   that I've experienced from multiple angles towards things like financial advice or investment
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.120]   advice, etc.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.780]   When I was younger, I was very much on the consumer side of financial advice.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:27.700]   And because I absorbed and consumed so much of that consumer-facing advice, the books
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.980]   about how to do it better yourself, how to do things cheaper, etc., I became suspicious
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.380]   of anybody who was involved in professional financial sales.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.160]   I thought that financial advisors were largely a scam, insurance agents were going to rip
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   you off.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.480]   I became convinced that across the board, the whole industry was probably filled with
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   charlatans and liars and cheats.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.700]   And then I joined it.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:07.920]   And so in 2008, when I first became a financial advisor, then I felt like I was wading into
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.080]   the lion's den, and I didn't really trust anybody.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.360]   And what was more difficult is that I started in the segment of the industry which is more
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.780]   maligned and impugned than perhaps any other segment of the industry, which is life insurance
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.780]   sales.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:28.500]   Jokes exist forever about life insurance sales and aggressive life insurance agents.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.860]   And because prior to becoming a life insurance agent, I was heavily steeped in the doctrines
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.340]   of "buy term insurance and invest the difference," and I was convinced that you should buy term
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.020]   and invest the difference, and that anybody who believed in whole life insurance or anybody
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.760]   who tried to sell universal life insurance was just a scammer and a crook who was trying
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.740]   to take more of your money away in the form of a bigger commission, a fat commission paycheck,
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.220]   and they didn't care about your long-term wealth and well-being.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.940]   And it was very difficult for me to overcome that.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:03.840]   I was never, even my entire time in the insurance business, I was never an aggressive salesman
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.020]   of whole life insurance because of those lingering just years of indoctrination to the cult of
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.140]   "buy term and invest the difference."
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.020]   Now I did become an enthusiastic proponent of whole life insurance in appropriate situations,
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.180]   but I never became an aggressive salesman of it.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.000]   And that fits into even the conversation today.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.740]   But along the way, being given the fact that I was earning my living based upon commissions
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.580]   from the sale of life insurance, from the sale of annuities, from the sale of mutual
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:47.260]   funds, and that I became a fee-based financial advisor and I started to earn fees based upon
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.980]   the management of money, I was always sensitive of the fact that I had conflicts of interest.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.300]   And I was always jealous of people that didn't have those perceived conflicts of interest.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   It bugged me when I was a financial advisor that someone would come into my office and
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.020]   they would say something to me and they would say, "Well, Clark Howard says such and such,"
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.620]   or "Dave Ramsey says such and such," or "Susie Orman says such and such," or "Jim
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.460]   Kramer says such and such."
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.420]   And I always felt inferior to those people because I thought, "Well, those people are
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.140]   saying what they have to say and they're able to say it without any conflicts of interest."
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.660]   They don't have any conflicts of interest, so they might be able to be completely true
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.340]   and honest and transparent and right, whereas I have conflicts of interest.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.300]   I get paid based upon the sale of a product.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.820]   And I worked the very best that I could to always manage those conflicts of interest
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:48.860]   and always represent the products that I represented honestly and forthrightly and give full disclosure
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.660]   and point out conflicts of interest.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.580]   I did the best that I could, but I always knew there's a real truth to that saying,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.660]   that it becomes—it's very difficult to get a man to see the truth if his salary depends
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.660]   upon it, right?
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.060]   I just butchered that phrase, but you know what I'm referring to, right?
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.060]   That it's very hard to get a man to see the truth that's in front of his own eyes if his
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.660]   salary depends upon his not seeing it.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.220]   And I wondered for years, "Am I really being honest?
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:20.180]   Am I genuinely being honest and truthful in my understanding here, or am I experiencing
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.140]   this conflict of interest?"
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:30.300]   And so when in 2013 I saw an off-ramp from that industry into—meaning from the world
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.820]   of commission sales and fees for financial advice, and I saw an off-ramp into what I
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.540]   had always admired, right?
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:45.780]   These titans of moral certitude, these men who have the ability to sit back and impartially
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:53.580]   judge the industry without any conflicts of interest, I found that amazingly attractive.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.260]   So so attractive.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.580]   Because I thought, "Wow, I could be that disconnected person.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:04.780]   I could be that impartial observer, that knowledgeable financial advisor who can sit back and who
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:13.700]   can impassionately—excuse me, dispassionately judge the truth of various claims, etc."
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.740]   And so for me, when I became host of Radical Personal Finance, it felt like a tremendous
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.240]   relief.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.860]   And one of my big concerns in the beginning of my business was I didn't want to recreate
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.840]   conflicts of interest.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.900]   And so I picked up this general belief.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.380]   I said, "I'm going to be honest."
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.420]   I made one of my early commitments to myself and to my audience.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.380]   I said, "I may not always know the answer.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.300]   I may not always get everything right.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.000]   I'm going to make mistakes.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.340]   But I'm going to be honest.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.660]   That's what I can control.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.660]   I can choose to be honest.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.660]   I can choose to be impartial and honest."
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:56.580]   And that's a commitment that I have made and that I have worked hard to keep to, even as
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.060]   I'm telling you shows on my mistakes.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.600]   It's part of that early commitment to simply be honest.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.980]   But in this case, I felt so relieved to be out of the world of those conflicts of interest
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.300]   that I reveled in my impartiality.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.060]   It just felt so good.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.060]   And it fit my personality.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.900]   Now, combine that with the fact that I had fairly modest financial goals.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.580]   I never set out to build an eight or nine-figure business.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.140]   I just wanted to make at the time, I just wanted to make $100,000 a year for my laptop.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.460]   And I thought, "I can totally do that."
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:36.220]   And so I'll enjoy this total freedom, this total freedom from conflicts of interest.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.980]   And I'll just be able to be that impartial observer.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.980]   And for me, it was largely an ego boost, right?
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.560]   It was pride.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.660]   It was a matter of personal pride that I'm going to be more righteous than all those
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.260]   other people out there who are still making their living on commissions.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.620]   And I had this kind of self-righteous attitude about my ability to be impartial.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   And I loved it.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.240]   I loved it.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:08.900]   In addition, I had some strong questions about other people's opinions.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:18.260]   And as I was watching this revolution in content and media content that I've been a part of
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.660]   with the growth of independent media, I'm watching this and I'm observing it and I'm
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.660]   saying, "You know what?
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.660]   This is awesome.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.620]   I love this lack of conflicts of interest."
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:33.140]   I wanted, from the very beginning, I wanted to keep that sense of impartiality.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.620]   I wanted to keep the lack of conflicts.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.300]   So I was heavily invested.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:49.540]   I chose to be ideologically heavily invested into models like listener support.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:56.260]   I came out and I said, "I'm going to do this with just total listener support.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.220]   I'm going to do everything for free."
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.940]   When I was a brand new host of Radical Personal Finance, my goal was, "I'm going to give away
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.260]   everything I know for free.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.900]   That way, it can help the people who are the most disadvantaged."
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.020]   I've said again and again, I always had a vision.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.860]   Seventeen-year-old kid in the hood has a phone, finds my show.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.460]   I'm going to teach that kid how to be rich.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.860]   That's my goal.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.980]   And I wanted to do it.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.860]   And so I poured myself out.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.900]   I tried very, very hard to try to do that.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:30.360]   And then I tried to set up funding models for me to be able to make a living directly
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.740]   from that content.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.700]   For about the first eight months or so of Radical Personal Finance, I worked a side
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.080]   job which paid my bills while I built the show.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.260]   Then my first goal was to build a member support system.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.900]   So I launched in the early days, I launched a membership site where many of my listeners
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.540]   were so generous to join that.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.500]   And I quickly started being able to make money.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.580]   It took me one year and after the first year, I've been able to generate all of my income
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.820]   directly from Radical Personal Finance.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.740]   Then along the way, so the membership support thing, I really, really wanted it to work.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.340]   And so I tried, worked at it, worked at it, worked at it.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.100]   I really wanted it to work because I wanted the sense of ideological purity.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:20.260]   For my own ego and my own kind of sense of personal righteousness, I wanted to have this
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.300]   ideological purity of saying, "Yeah, I don't sell anything.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.380]   Yeah, I don't sell anything, right?
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.200]   My listeners support me."
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.020]   And that fit my ego.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.100]   It was a goal that I had.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.980]   And again, I did it, but I really tried at it.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.180]   So then my membership site, it wasn't working.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.140]   I eventually took that down and I turned to Patreon.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.180]   At the time, Patreon had newly launched and I was like, "I'm going to make this Patreon
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.180]   thing work."
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   I loved it.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.940]   I thought, "Oh, this would just be so wonderful, right?
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:52.860]   You'll build all this listener supported content and you'll be supported directly by your listeners.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.500]   There's no conflicts of interest.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.580]   It allows me to do what I love, which is to turn on a microphone and speak and teach."
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.660]   I just thought, "This is going to be awesome."
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.380]   And so I really invested heavily, a lot of time.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.540]   I promoted it heavily.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.220]   I invested a lot of time into it.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:15.820]   And year after year went by and I was deeply focused on the listener support model.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.700]   Well, I consider the listener support model a total failure.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.740]   A few years ago, I spoke at FinCon on the topic and I said, "Look, I've made..."
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.300]   I can't remember how much it was at the time, but six figures, multiple...
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.380]   I can't remember.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.420]   But I put all my earnings from Patreon up on the screen and I said, "Look, this is how
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.700]   much money I've made on Patreon."
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.700]   And I was in the top...
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:42.100]   At the time, I was in the top few percent of the top tier of anybody who was making
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.820]   any money on Patreon.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:51.940]   And I said, "So I have succeeded," if by success we mean here that at the time, I was among
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:56.100]   all financial podcasters and people out there who were making the most money on Patreon.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.180]   I said, "Look, I've succeeded."
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.220]   And I said from the stage, I said, "I don't encourage you to do this.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   It doesn't work."
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.900]   All right, you get this tiny, tiny percentage of the audience who actually supports you.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.660]   And I said, "Forgive me, and I don't mean this sounding ungrateful.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.380]   I'm just trying to be honest."
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:21.100]   But I told the people at FinCon, I said, "It's the worst possible way for you to try to monetize
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.100]   your work."
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.300]   I said, "It just doesn't work.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.820]   And it will hurt you if you go down this road."
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.860]   I was very conscious of the fact that I had wasted several years trying to maintain this
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.420]   sense of impartiality and trying to avoid these conflicts of interest.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.420]   I had wasted several years.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.540]   Now fast forward, then I started to make, I switched and I started, okay, well, I could
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   do ads.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.840]   And there've been many times in radical personal finance where I did ads.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.860]   But I really, again, wanted that sense of impartiality.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:56.340]   I wanted to be able to make a personal endorsement of every advertiser that I brought on the
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.340]   show.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.140]   And so people approached me to run ads and I would say, "Oh, no, I got to personally
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.140]   approve of it.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.220]   If it's going to go on my show, it's going to be a sense of personal endorsement."
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.180]   And so I did some ads and I made money with ads.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.660]   But because of the standards of I'm going to personally endorse all this stuff, I walked
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.300]   away from so much stuff.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.380]   I walked away, I did very few affiliate deals, right, where I promote somebody else's products
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.060]   or somebody else's services.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.540]   I did very few affiliate deals because I thought, well, I just want to be, I want that sense
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.500]   of purity.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.460]   And to this day, right, most of the things that I have promoted here on radical personal
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.980]   finance have been my own products and my own services.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.000]   And I'm thankful because those things have been profitable.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.380]   But along the way, I have not made nearly as much money as I could have made.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.100]   It's been a very expensive financial mistake.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.700]   Today, I can face it square on and say, you know what, doing that again, I would not do
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.700]   it.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.140]   Let me just share with you something that you should know, though.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.540]   I'm trying to share my experiences, but if you're one who just simply rejects what I
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.660]   have to say and says, I've got to prove it out for myself, I understand that because
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.580]   that's largely my personality.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.160]   I like to listen carefully to what other people say.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.580]   But if I have a sense of conviction about something, a sense that this is something
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.540]   that I want to do, this is something that's right, then I have this kind of press where
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.580]   I got to learn this myself.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.460]   I don't consider that as character strength.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.540]   I consider it something that should be managed, but it is something that is true about me.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.860]   And so if you had told me all this years ago, I don't know that I would have been willing
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.020]   to not try what I did because at the time it seemed important to me.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:33.340]   It was what I wanted to do, and I wanted to have that sense of impartiality that for me
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.620]   was very important to my ego.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:42.140]   So I understand if you want to do this, but I'll tell you today that I consider this one
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.580]   of the biggest mistakes.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.140]   Going forward, I will change.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.060]   Now it's hard for me to change.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.220]   It's always hard for all of us, but it's hard for me to go from somebody who was never aggressive,
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.140]   who was never kind of an aggressive, pushy salesman.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:04.100]   It's hard for me to change my personality and my character to become the kind of strong,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.660]   pressing, aggressive marketer that I desire to be.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:15.980]   And I'll tell you why I can say without fear of error that I desire to be that person.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.900]   The reason is this.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.780]   If you think that a sense of impartiality is what you want, what I want to tell you
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:35.420]   is that the reason that I desired that objective impartiality,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.900]   that lack of conflicts of interest, was because I wanted to help people.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.140]   I genuinely, desperately want to help people.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.460]   I want the world to be a richer place.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:59.980]   I want to make an impact on the finances of the world so that many millions of people
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.420]   are wealthier in years to come than they are today.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.180]   Now I want that in a non-financial context, but I also very much want it in a financial
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.380]   context.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.460]   And I do not believe in a world of limited resources.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:23.140]   I believe that there is no reason why in decades to come, tens of millions of us cannot be
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.880]   enjoying a much more wealthy lifestyle.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.380]   And I want to be part of that.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.900]   Genuinely want to help bring wealth to the world.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:40.060]   If you look back over the last century and you see how many advances we have made as
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.420]   a human population in the world, it is absolutely staggering.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.420]   And I'm excited to see what things will look like a century from now.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.100]   And so I want to be part of that.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:56.420]   I want to be a catalyst for that kind of change.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:05.100]   I thought that by removing my conflicts of interest I could be a more effective catalyst.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:13.020]   But what has actually been true is I have been dramatically less effective because I
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:19.780]   have never had the financial resources to expand my influence and reach the people that
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.060]   I most want to reach.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:29.300]   See in order for a business to work, the business has to make profit.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.220]   A business has to make profit in order for it to work.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.460]   And I understand that quickly your brain goes, "Well Joshua, what about a non-profit?"
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.500]   We'll come back to those in a moment.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:49.340]   But I am convinced that one of the most important things is that any activity make a sufficient
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.500]   profit for it to be worth it doing for the owners.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.980]   A business that doesn't bring in enough profit to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.620]   its operation will always close.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:13.380]   And I came many times very close to closing my business because it didn't make enough
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.440]   profit.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:22.020]   And looking back when I reflect on eight years of work, I should be miles ahead of where
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.980]   I am today in terms of the number of people that are on my team, in terms of the number
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.060]   of people that we impact on a daily basis, in terms of the teaching that we're able to
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.860]   bring to people who need it the most.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:45.020]   And along the way, one of the most important reasons that I'm not having that kind of
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:52.600]   impact yet is that I did not prioritize maximum profit.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:25:01.220]   If I had prioritized maximum profit, I would have been able to serve many, many more people
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.780]   than I have up until this date.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.100]   So why didn't I prioritize maximum profit?
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.020]   I didn't focus on marketing.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.060]   I didn't focus on selling.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.660]   I always thought, "Well, if you build it good enough, they'll come."
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.820]   And it is true.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:22.300]   But if you'll build it good enough and then market it like crazy, more and more will come.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:29.180]   And if you have something good, you owe it to people to do your very best to market it.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.740]   Now, here's what I've learned.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:41.460]   I have often used lack of marketing desire, a lack of push for desire, to allow me to
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.500]   get away with more mediocrity than I'm capable of.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.660]   Meaning that a lot of times, if I had dedicated myself and said, "You know what?
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:55.060]   I'm going to build something that's truly outstanding, truly outstanding, and I'm going
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:03.580]   to market it like crazy," then that puts within you a higher expectation of desire to do better,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.860]   to create something better, because your name is behind it.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.020]   Whereas if you kind of give yourself the permission to say, "I'm going to create something, but
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.420]   I'm not going to really market it all that much," then you're kind of okay with failure
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.660]   and you don't put yourself out there.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.780]   You don't risk it as much as you should.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:26.100]   And so, along the way, I just see again and again how I've been hurt by this lack of marketing.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:31.820]   And then the lack of revenue, because you don't market as hard and as aggressively as
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:38.060]   you can, the lack of revenue causes you to not be able to expand, not be able to expand
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.100]   your abilities, not be able to expand your operations, not to be able to impact people
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:51.460]   with better, higher quality advice, better, higher quality services.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.540]   I recommend that you market hard.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:59.980]   Now, there are a lot of people just like me who were never comfortable with marketing
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.980]   hard.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.740]   I've always been a little bit jealous of people who just had the self-confidence and the ability
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.740]   just to market hard, to sell aggressively.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.500]   I was never that guy who I could walk over and say, "Hey, how are you?
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   Who are you?
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   Do you want any life insurance?"
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   That was never me.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.200]   I was always more timid.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:24.620]   But what I have learned is if you market hard, you have the ability to help people.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.900]   And the people that you're going to help are actually going to appreciate that marketing.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:34.580]   Now, what I observe in personal finance circles is there are a whole lot of people who are
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.740]   dedicated to frugality, which I appreciate and have appreciated.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.700]   I think it's overwrought, overstated, but I've appreciated that.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:48.940]   But I've also come to realize that a lot of them are dedicated to poverty.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.420]   I don't say that lightly.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.460]   A lot of people who I used to think were just dedicated to frugality, I actually believe
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.300]   are dedicated to poverty.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.240]   They're dedicated to poverty and they don't appreciate money-making.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.460]   So they're caught in this existential crisis where they want to be wealthy, they want to
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.140]   be financially independent, but they don't want to actually buy anything or they don't
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.060]   want to actually sell anything.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.900]   And I think this leads to this really bad personality disorder where you wind up becoming
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.920]   a hoarder, you wind up becoming a miser.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.140]   And what I have realized is I don't want to be that.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.500]   I want to be someone through whom money flows dramatically.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:30.360]   I don't want to be someone for whom money comes in and then it just gets stuck aside.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:38.460]   And I find this interesting because as I observe even political debates and political arguments,
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.400]   I observe that I think there's more—and I'm just speaking here from a perspective
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:55.060]   of reading in some personal finance conversations, fret threads, public posts, groups, etc.—but
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:29:08.480]   there are more progressive, liberal, left-leaning people who are more miserly with their investments
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.640]   than so many billionaires are.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.860]   There are more people who are liberal progressives who believe in spreading the wealth around,
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:23.080]   who believe that the accumulation of wealth is morally not a good thing, and yet all they
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.120]   do is collect as much money as they possibly can and then put it in their 401(k) so they
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.380]   can become financially independent.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.120]   They don't build anything, they don't invest anything, they just put it aside in their
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.520]   401(k), put it in their bank account, put it in their house, and they don't grow.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.760]   Meanwhile you turn—and I study billionaires a lot of times—and you look and you say,
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   "What is so-and-so doing?"
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.200]   And you're looking and you're like, "This guy doesn't have a thing in his stock account,
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.320]   he doesn't have a 401(k)."
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.560]   Everything is invested back into a business over here, creating something there.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:59.400]   I'm not trying to argue this too deeply, I'm saying that what shocked me is I realized
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:06.960]   that while I personally identify as a capitalist and I believe that capitalism is single-handedly
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.980]   the most effective tool that we have ever discovered for bringing billions of people
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:22.360]   around the world out of total abject poverty, I've been an awful capitalist.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.800]   And that pisses me off.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:35.840]   It angers me to find myself having been in a situation where I didn't pursue the things
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.600]   that I thought I believed in.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.680]   I always believed in the power of capitalism, but I didn't actually demonstrate my belief
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.720]   by my actions.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.920]   I said that I had faith in the power of capitalism, but I didn't demonstrate my faith by my actions.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.320]   Rather, by my actions I looked and acted as though wealth was something to be shunned,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.920]   wealth was something to be eschewed, wealth was something that you just simply went out
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.680]   and got a little bit and then hoarded it all up a side because after all it might end.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.000]   And when I've realized that, it's like, no, that is not me.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.560]   I will not live that way.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:19.200]   I will not be that frugal man who goes out and says, "Oh, you know what?
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.960]   Something's going to end and after all this could just all fall apart."
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:31.520]   I want to be somebody not to whom money flows and stays there like dead stinking water.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.840]   I want to be somebody through whom money flows.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.480]   And I found myself again and again and again over the last few years finding situations
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:46.800]   where I'm like, "If I could just, if I could write a check and invest a six or seven figure
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.240]   sum into this particular thing, it could make a difference in the world."
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.780]   And I find myself unable to do that.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.800]   And that pisses me off.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:05.460]   Forgive the vulgar speech, but it really does.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.220]   And there's no excuse for it.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.800]   Absolutely no excuse for it, except that I was committed to this self-righteous sense
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:21.640]   of impartiality, objectivity, no conflicts of interest.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.920]   It's not healthy.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.680]   It's not healthy.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.880]   Self-righteousness is ugly.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   It's really ugly.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   And it's not healthy.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.480]   It's not a healthy place to live.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.040]   It's not a healthy place to be.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.220]   It's not.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.260]   I don't believe that...
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.960]   And one more comment on kind of conflicts of interest.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.500]   It took me years to the point where I could really trust my instincts and trust my perspectives.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.620]   Because I do think that the...
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.460]   I mean, there's a reason why we have that term "conflict of interest," right?
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.100]   You're involved in a certain area of the marketplace.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.180]   You're involved in something.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:09.420]   And if you stand to make a good deal of money, it can be a real temptation to do that.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:17.300]   But I think that probably the majority of people...
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.540]   I don't know what percentage to put on it, right?
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:27.180]   There are sociopaths who just don't understand how their actions are going to influence other
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.180]   people.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.580]   I think most people are actually more honest than they're often given credit for.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.820]   That was what surprised me when I went into the life insurance business.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.980]   I went into the life insurance business expecting to meet a whole bunch of crooks and charlatans
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.260]   and people who were just out to make more money on commissions.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.620]   And I met a whole lot of people that really loved making commissions.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.500]   But they genuinely believed that what they were doing was good.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.320]   They genuinely believed that what they were doing was right.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.220]   And I realized that so many of the arguments that people would have about things are just
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.980]   academic things where it's about to make themselves feel good, right?
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:11.480]   You tell somebody, "Oh, you shouldn't invest in such and such because there's something
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.300]   else theoretically that's better."
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.020]   And maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.020]   But here's what's funny.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.660]   Earlier I said the "buy, term, invest, the difference" argument.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.420]   This is one of the most popular arguments in personal finance.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.420]   What should you do?
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.060]   Buy, term, invest, the difference.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:36.140]   I would say that anybody who's ever said to somebody they shouldn't buy whole life insurance
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:45.660]   and instead should buy stocks owes an apology for ever having advised anybody to buy stocks
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:52.220]   when they could have bought Bitcoin.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.540]   If you've ever told someone what you should do is you should not buy whole life insurance.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.100]   Rather what you should do is you should buy this stock market index fund over here because
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.100]   you'll come out better.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.580]   So buy, term, and invest, the difference in stocks.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:11.260]   Well, you better go back to every person you've ever said that to and apologize for not having
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.900]   told them to buy Bitcoin because you did them a huge disservice, as did I, right?
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.840]   I did a show on why I missed Bitcoin.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.580]   So I've apologized for that.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.260]   If you've ever said that you owe every person you've said that an apology to.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.580]   Now if you reject that, if you bristle at that, if you say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.060]   wait, wait, hold on a second.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:35.100]   Bitcoin is not equivalent to the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.540]   These are not equivalent investments."
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:42.700]   Then you've just found the answer to the classic argument over should you buy whole life insurance
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.380]   or term insurance.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.560]   These are not equivalent investments.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   They are different things.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.760]   They're fundamentally different, unique things.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.380]   It's not a matter of right or wrong.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.380]   It's a matter of fit.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.740]   It's a matter of understanding what's appropriate in a situation.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.620]   And when I finally understood that and I went back and realized, I looked at it and said,
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.620]   "You know what?
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.560]   You do have people of different conviction."
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.940]   My conviction when I was a life insurance agent and I sold disability insurance and
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.760]   life insurance, long-term care insurance, my conviction level changed about insurance
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:24.300]   products because of the experiences that I had.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.780]   When you sell life insurance, you tend to wind up paying more attention when people
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.840]   die.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.140]   When you sell life insurance, you wind up understanding how much people screw up their
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.100]   own investments.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.640]   And so you wind up having a sense of conviction about it.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.420]   And that changed me over time where I realized, "You know what?
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.820]   80% of these people that I work with are not crooks.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.300]   I thought they were, but they're not.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:52.900]   They're just ordinary men and women doing their very best to give good advice based
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.780]   upon the way that they see the world.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.240]   Just like you and just like me."
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.160]   So those conflicts of interest that we're all trying to seek to avoid, those conflicts
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.060]   of interest are not something that can ever be avoided.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.300]   There's always going to be conflicts of interest.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:20.220]   And I don't know any way to handle them other than to acknowledge them, verbalize them,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.260]   disclose them, and try to manage them.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.420]   We all have conflicts of interest.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.500]   And what do you do?
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.860]   I don't like dishonesty.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:34.060]   I'm the guy who...
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.060]   One version of jokes.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.860]   Don't ever tell Joshua Sheets a joke about...
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.180]   Never mind.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:47.020]   The point is that you're never going to escape those conflicts of interest.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:56.900]   And what I have learned is if you want genuinely the ability to ignore those conflicts of interest,
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:02.300]   it helps a whole lot to be rich.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:09.700]   The brand new salesman for whatever product has a hard time walking away from potential
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:16.660]   money, but the wealthy salesman has an easier time of saying, "Yeah, this is a situation
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.260]   in which it's a good fit is where it's not a good fit."
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.940]   And so if you want to help yourself avoid those conflicts of interest, poverty is not
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.140]   the way to do it.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.380]   Rather, wealth is the way to do it.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:35.620]   And you can become wealthy and you can sell hard without fear if you understand that.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.300]   Now what about aggressive sales?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:43.860]   Here's what I have realized from not doing aggressive sales.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:50.580]   You do aggressive sales if you actually genuinely want to move people to action.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:56.420]   I think all of us have found people who were too aggressive for us at a certain point in
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.960]   time.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.980]   Somebody who pushed us to make a decision.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.420]   Somebody who pushed us to say yes to something, to buy something, to sign up for that.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:12.460]   And we've often felt like, "Oh, that guy was just too aggressive for me."
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.660]   But then probably all of us have experienced a time where we felt like, "You know what?
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.420]   I'm really glad that I acted.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.280]   I'm really glad that I made the decision."
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:29.240]   And what I've discovered is that fear of being forcefully sold to is another poverty character
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.180]   trait by background.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:39.500]   I remember when I was a new financial advisor, I was scared to talk to rich people.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.220]   And I thought that rich people were going to be the hardest people to reach.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.140]   I thought that they were going to be the people who didn't want to talk to me, who weren't
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.740]   interested in what I had to say.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.780]   I was scared of talking to rich people.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.260]   And I thought that poor people were going to be easier to talk to because poor people
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.260]   needed money.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.620]   Well, I learned pretty quickly that it was the exact opposite.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.280]   Poor people were often the most difficult people to talk to, whereas rich people were
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.820]   often the easiest.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.780]   To this day, I could go back and I could give list after list of wealthy person who I would
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.540]   pick them up, pick up the phone, call them, say, "Hey, can I come and tell you what I
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.340]   do and what I have to share and blah, blah, blah?"
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.680]   And they would say, "Yeah, come on in."
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.180]   And what I learned is, right, they might only give me five minutes, but they say, "Hey,
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   listen, Joshua, what do you got?
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.180]   I'm really interested.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.180]   Show me what you got.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.940]   Tell me about it."
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.300]   Whereas poor people, "No, no, no, no, no, I've got a guy," right?
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.600]   Or, "I'm not interested in any of that," or, "I don't need that right now."
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.740]   And I've come to believe that there is a dramatic reason why this is the case.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.860]   And I don't know whether it's causation or correlation, right?
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:43.380]   Is a wealthy person open to hearing what people have to say about money because he has a lot
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:50.820]   of money, or did a wealthy person become wealthy because he was open to hearing from a lot
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.380]   of people what they had to say about money?
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:58.220]   I don't know, but I think my bet is that it's probably more causation than correlation.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.780]   And I've realized, if you go back, right, think about, I was talking about Bitcoin,
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:03.780]   right?
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.400]   It's the most amazing example, astonishing example that we have right now of dramatic
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.100]   wealth change.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:14.060]   The people who have become wealthy on Bitcoin became so because they were open to hearing
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:21.160]   new ideas and they were open to thinking about things and they were open to trying things.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.500]   The people who didn't become wealthy were closed-minded.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:30.740]   Now, I raise my hand and confess, I have many, many times been closed-minded.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:35.100]   Closed-mindedness has not served me.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.100]   Open-mindedness has.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.940]   Now, what about buying things?
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.140]   I remember a number of years ago, I went to a gym.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:48.900]   I went to an LA Fitness in the United States and I wanted to sign up and I wanted to go
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.860]   and buy a gym membership.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:56.540]   And so, like many people, I walked into the gym planning to sign up for their 1495, whatever
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.780]   it was, LA Fitness membership.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.640]   And I walked in and told them to do that and they started to take my information and one
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:10.120]   of the personal trainers started a sales process and wound up trying very aggressively to sell
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.020]   me a personal training package.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.340]   And I remember sitting in the sales presentation and my instinct was to run away from the personal
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.540]   training package because after all, I'm Mr. Frugal, right?
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.380]   Why would I spend, whatever it was, $250 a month or $300 a month?
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:31.300]   Why would I spend that when I could avoid that and just spend $14.95 a month?
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.500]   But I realized, I said, "Which is more expensive?
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:41.220]   The personal training package for $300 a month that I show up to or the 1495 gym membership
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.460]   that I never go to?"
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:48.260]   And in my lifetime, I'd signed up for so many 1495 or 2995 gym memberships that I never
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.180]   went to that it was just a total waste.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.860]   But I showed up when I hired a personal trainer and had a lesson.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.940]   Like, this is how life is.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.740]   That 1495 is far more expensive.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:07.480]   And the older I get, the more I realize the value and the importance of paying for things.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.180]   The value and the importance of paying people for advice.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.020]   One of the very best investments you could ever make with money is pay people for advice.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.020]   Pay people for their time.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.420]   If somebody's got something that you want, pay them money and get in where you can get
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.420]   it.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.740]   It's the best thing you can do.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.420]   Paying people for results.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.700]   Buying things right.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:36.100]   Again and again, I have come to just be convinced every time I make the so-called frugal decision,
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.740]   every time I cheap out on something, I lose.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.220]   I lose.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:47.620]   And I especially lose one of those most valuable things that I have, which is time.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:57.980]   I've come to be convinced that people who bristle at being sold to, people who bristle
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:07.980]   at being marketed to, are generally losers who don't understand that quality things,
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:14.700]   quality life, quality services, quality products are worth having.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.060]   They really are.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:23.380]   Now there is a very clear dividing point as to should I be in this place or not.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:31.860]   If you've got a $15 an hour job and you walk into a Rolls Royce dealership, that Rolls
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:38.540]   Royce dealer is not going to put on you an aggressive sales technique.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.780]   He's not going to do it because it's going to be obvious to him, this guy can't buy a
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.780]   Rolls Royce.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.420]   He's going to let you walk around, look at the cars and you're going to be on your way.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.500]   But if you're the kind of guy who genuinely wants a Rolls Royce and whatever, it's going
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:56.620]   to cost you $400,000, but you're thinking about cheaping out and buying the $200,000
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:02.660]   car when you really want the $400,000 car, if he believes in his product, he's going
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.700]   to say you're going to be happier with the Rolls Royce and he's going to try his best
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.540]   to sell it to you in the very best way possible.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:12.940]   And you, if you want the Rolls Royce, you should go for it because we don't live in
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.740]   a world in which money is limited.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.540]   Money is literally unlimited.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.380]   There's an unlimited amount of money that exists.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.540]   There's an unlimited amount of money that's available to you.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.700]   There is no limit whatsoever to the amount of wealth that we can create in the world
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.620]   and the amount of wealth that you can have in your life.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.340]   And if you genuinely understand that, then it should transform your decisions.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:42.580]   People who are parsimonious, they're losers, right?
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.100]   They don't win in the long run.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:52.580]   And so what I've realized is I spent too much of my life being that guy who didn't believe
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:57.240]   in himself and believe in his own stuff and thus would pull back.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.860]   And then because I knew I didn't believe in my own stuff and believe in what I was doing
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.020]   and believe in the value, I didn't sell it as aggressive as I should have, as I could
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.020]   have.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.740]   And then because of that, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.660]   So I believe in honesty.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:21.460]   If you don't have something worth spending money on, the solution to that is go out and
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.380]   develop something worth spending money on.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.780]   Do the hard work.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.780]   Do the study.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.780]   Do the R&D.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.780]   Do the development.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.060]   Practice the engineering.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:35.700]   But what you'll discover if you do that is that people want answers.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.860]   I spend a lot of money on advice because I want answers.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:45.380]   I have limited time and I want very fast results, which means that I need expertise.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.300]   I need the answers.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.420]   And every tentative step that I have taken in that direction in my life, it has always
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.700]   paid off.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.460]   It has always paid off.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.420]   Wish I could have snapped my fingers years ago and just automatically become that kind
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.140]   of person, that aggressive person.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:12.340]   But I tell you, more and more I want to do it.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.180]   And here's what happens.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:20.220]   The people who can't afford something always ride on the coattails of those who can.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:27.140]   In almost any industry, in almost any place, my free podcast does not pay me to create
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.140]   it.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.460]   If I did this podcast for free, I probably would have welched on my bet to myself to
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.460]   do a thousand.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.820]   I don't know.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.540]   Maybe I would have had the confidence and self-determination to do it, but I probably
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.180]   would have welched.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:45.660]   It's my high-paying clients who have provided me with the bandwidth to keep giving away
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.180]   the information for free.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.500]   And in virtually every field it works like that.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:58.780]   Right now, very wealthy men and women are pouring billions and billions of dollars into
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.420]   interesting areas of research, pouring billions and billions of dollars into space travel,
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.500]   pouring billions of dollars into anti-aging technologies.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.000]   They're just pouring money into these spaces.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.980]   And all the poor people are going to win because of it.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.940]   They're going to be the benefactor or the beneficiary a decade from now of all of the
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:27.580]   money that Jeff Bezos is investing into anti-aging research.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.620]   Because they're going to make the—at the curve, they're going to make the discoveries
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.340]   and you're going to get that information practically for free.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:40.540]   So poor people, people who won't pay for stuff, always ride on the coattails of the rich people
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.020]   who will pay for stuff.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:49.540]   So you should not be ashamed and embarrassed about selling something, about developing
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.540]   something.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.780]   It's a poverty scarcity mindset that keeps you in that place.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:06.180]   I wish I had a clearer way of resolving this show, but that is one of my biggest mistakes,
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:13.860]   is believing that progressive crap that somehow the accumulation of resources was a was a
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.180]   downside.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.420]   And again, I don't mean to be offensive, but it is the fact, right?
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:24.620]   There are so many people who are super frugal, super money conscious, don't want to sell
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.660]   anything, don't like to be sold to.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.140]   And what happens is there are leeches upon society.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.660]   The money comes in, comes in, comes in.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.860]   It gets piled up, piled up, piled up like that old miser and nothing ever happens because
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.620]   they haven't changed.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.140]   And again, I've been there.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.540]   I don't want that to be the case.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:44.060]   I want to be someone who grows and who changes and who I want to be someone who changes the
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.060]   world.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:50.260]   In order to do that, you got to sell, you got to have something worth selling, and then
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.260]   you got to sell it.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.060]   Because if you're going to help someone, you're going to sell it.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.700]   If you truly believe, and this was the thing about life insurance sales, it came to be
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   convinced.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:04.180]   All right, when I was before I became a life insurance agent, I read a book and I decided
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.180]   I was going to do it.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.860]   And I read a book called How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.300]   I forget the author now, but it's a classic kind of motivational book.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:17.540]   And the author talked a lot about how he learned to do what was at that time called a one-call
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.620]   close, a one-call close.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.140]   And at the time I was scared to do that because I thought this is going to be, this is going
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:29.900]   to, for me to do a one-call close, meaning one visit and tell the person, buy the insurance,
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.180]   then I'm going to have to be aggressive.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.180]   And I'm not aggressive.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.180]   I'm not confrontational.
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:37.020]   I don't, I don't push people to do that because after all, I don't make decisions quickly.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.300]   After all, I think on it, right?
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.020]   I always take my time to make a good decision and think on it.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.220]   I don't act impulsively with my money.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.460]   And so how could I ask someone else to be, to act impulsively with their money?
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.460]   Right?
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.460]   How could I do that?
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.460]   And so I was scared of that.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.400]   Well, I quickly found out in training, I was like, we don't, I don't do that anymore.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.300]   That was, they did the one-call close and it was here, buy $5,000 of life insurance.
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:01.660]   Well, in the modern world, I don't, I never met an insurance agent who would ever sell
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.580]   someone life insurance on the first, on the first call.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:10.660]   But what I came to realize is that with life insurance, like if you actually understand
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:20.620]   life insurance, there's literally, and when I say literally, I mean literally, there's
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:25.660]   literally no reason if you think you might want some life insurance at some point in
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:29.980]   the future, there's literally never a reason not to act now in the way that insurance law
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.220]   in the United States works.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.220]   Right?
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.140]   All you do is you fill out an application, you give somebody their first month premium,
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.100]   you do your medical exam and you're insured on a conditional basis.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:44.740]   And while it's very uncommon, obviously, that someone would die when their policy is an
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.600]   underwriting, it does happen.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.380]   And there's literally no reason why a week later, you can't say, you know what?
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.540]   I don't want the insurance.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:58.100]   There's no, there's no reason why the insurance agent can't bring you your insurance policy.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.820]   And you usually have a two week free look period, 30 days sometimes where you can return
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.260]   the policy and get all your money back.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:09.620]   And so I realized like if you actually care about people, you owe it to them to actually
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:14.380]   make them say like, do the application and give me money and at the very least get free
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.660]   insurance.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.660]   It's not a sales gimmick.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.980]   It's a matter of care.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.980]   Right?
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:24.780]   If you genuinely believe that somebody, you're leaving a party and you genuinely believe
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:30.180]   that somebody is possibly endangering his life or the lives of others by driving drunk,
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.980]   you owe it to him to stop him.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.180]   If you genuinely believe that somebody's actions are going to take him to hell, you owe it
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.420]   to him to preach the gospel.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:45.020]   If you genuinely believe that somebody is doing something that's going to harm their
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.020]   family, you owe it to them to point it out to them.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.660]   You owe somebody honesty.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:55.060]   If you actually care about people, you owe them a duty of honesty.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   And honesty means that if you have something that you genuinely believe is good for somebody,
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:06.220]   then you had better sell it to them and tell them why they should buy it and do it aggressively
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:11.180]   so that they'll want to buy it.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.900]   And then those who do, right?
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.740]   Stand behind your work.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:19.100]   It's easy to offer a refund if somebody is dissatisfied.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.420]   You're not going to please everybody, but you owe it to people to do it and to do it
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.660]   to your best of your ability.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.500]   I wish I could have grasped that 15 years ago.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.980]   I wish I could have grasped it.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.940]   But I think I grasp it today.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:46.420]   And 15 years hence, I predict it will transform my life and I want it to transform yours as
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.140]   well.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:52.960]   Don't be a loser who doesn't believe in what you do and believe in what you sell.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.360]   If you can't sell something with passion, get out, go somewhere else and find something
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.160]   you can sell with passion.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.300]   But if you're creating something, if you're building something, sell with passion.
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.420]   Sell to people who need it, right?
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:10.820]   The classic thing that became very clear to me is that there was never a reason to be
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:17.900]   concerned about selling aggressively in the insurance world because the only mistake that
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:22.620]   you could make was not choosing the correct advice for somebody.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:28.300]   And so this classic argument over buy term and invest the difference that I like to harp
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:34.060]   on, it was just a classic error of identification.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:39.060]   Meaning the kind of person who is a good fit for term life insurance is fairly obvious.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:43.460]   And the kind of person for whom a whole life insurance policy is a good fit is also fairly
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.820]   obvious.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.580]   And you only have a problem when you mix those up.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.980]   You only have a problem if you're sitting in front of somebody who makes $50,000 a year
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.740]   and has young kids and you're trying to tell them, "Oh, what you really need is $50,000
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.740]   a whole life insurance."
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.380]   Like, that's your problem, right?
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.420]   No, he doesn't need it.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:03.220]   He needs $500,000 a term life insurance.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:06.340]   But for the vast majority of people, and I think insurance agents, although they've never
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.420]   been able to prove it, right?
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.460]   People have horror stories, they've been treated badly.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.380]   I know that stuff is out there.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.140]   But at least in my experience, I think the vast majority of insurance agents always understood
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.140]   that.
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:22.220]   And I very rarely, in my work with any agents, I very rarely came across a situation in which
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.660]   they did the wrong thing.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.660]   It's obvious.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.020]   Now, there are, in a very small number of situations, times where you're like, "Well,
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.100]   you could go either way here."
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.140]   And in my experience, most of the people that I worked with in the financial industry pointed
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.140]   it out.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.300]   They said, "This is what we do."
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:44.160]   And so a lot of it just comes down to identification.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.620]   And so these conflicts that we think are conflicts are not a problem.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:56:00.300]   You're not going to...
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.300]   Nobody's going to be...
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.300]   No $15 an hour worker is going to be pressured into buying a Rolls Royce.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.180]   It's not going to happen.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.980]   And while you might think, "Oh, that $15 an hour worker got pressured into buying the
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:16.500]   new Kia," and you might think it would have been smarter for them to go and buy a three-year-old
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:21.180]   Toyota, you can always look at it another way and just say, "Hey, make the best of what
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.180]   you've got."
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.180]   Right?
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.500]   New Kia with a seven-year powertrain warranty, whatever it used to be, 10-year powertrain
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.500]   warranty.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:31.620]   Just drive the car and go about other things.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:36.660]   You may sense kind of overloading with that same thing with frugality, but a lot of times
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:39.480]   I just discovered I've been wrong on a lot of stuff.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.740]   And this is one of those things, right?
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:45.660]   The frugality, the trying to save money and whatnot, the opportunity cost of that has
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.660]   been high.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.020]   But that, my friends, is a show for another day.
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.180]   Thank you for listening.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:54.380]   And while I don't have anything to promote right here, stay tuned because I will be starting
