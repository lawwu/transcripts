[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.900]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.900]   and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.900]   freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host. And today on the podcast,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.400]   I want to talk to you about the ultimate freedom machine.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.900]   The ultimate freedom machine. When I use the term freedom, let me define it.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.900]   I want to include most of the senses of freedom.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.900]   I want to use freedom in the sense that allows you to come and go where you want to go.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.900]   I want to use freedom in the financial sense as well because here we're continually
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   talking about financial freedom. Now in my
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.900]   predominantly U.S. American audience, we have a cultural
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.900]   perception, a cultural conception that
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900]   the ultimate freedom machine is a personal automobile.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.900]   Perhaps you've heard of that. After all, if you think about it, having
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   a car, well, you can come and go where and when you want.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.900]   You can go pretty much wherever you want on your own schedule.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.900]   You don't have to integrate and wait for a train. You don't have to wait for a plane. You come
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.900]   and go anytime, anyplace you want. But unfortunately,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.900]   while this is a component of freedom,
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.900]   the personal automobile doesn't actually buy
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.900]   you freedom. On the contrary, I would say that for many people, it
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.900]   buys you financial bondage. The
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.900]   personal automobile comes with a long list of
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.900]   never-ending costs.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.900]   Now some of them are obvious. You have a pretty substantial up-front
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.900]   purchase price. That's fairly evident. Some people take that fairly substantial
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   up-front purchase price and amortize it out with a series of monthly payments,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.900]   having car payments or lease payments. Those can
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   be a significant monthly cost, but the costs don't end. If you think about
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   some of the other costs of an automobile, you have things like requirements for
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.900]   having automobile insurance. And as long as
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   you own a vehicle, you have to have automobile
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.900]   insurance. I found this out myself the hard way. A number of years
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   ago, I left the United States and I had a car in the United States. It wasn't being driven. I parked it
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.900]   and decided, "You know what? I'll save some money. Why should I pay for insurance
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.900]   on that automobile that I'm not using? After all, it's just sitting
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.900]   there. No one's driving it. I don't need to have insurance on it." So I cancelled the insurance
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.900]   policy. Then a few months later, I received a rather
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.900]   not-so-friendly letter from the state of
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.900]   Florida informing me that my driver's license was
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.900]   cancelled because I had cancelled the insurance on a vehicle
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   and I had not turned in the license plate. So word to the
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.900]   tip for you. You can, with many insurance
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   companies, I would assume most, but you can, at least with some insurance companies,
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.900]   purchase a special storage automobile insurance policy, which is
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.900]   what I subsequently did. A storage policy allows you to keep the
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   vehicle, keep the plate on the vehicle, but you represent to the insurance company
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900]   that you're not going to drive the vehicle and they reduce your insurance
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.900]   rates substantially while still maintaining coverage for
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   your legally-mandated insurance requirements. So keep that in mind if you're ever traveling
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.900]   or storing a vehicle. Don't cancel your insurance, even if you're not driving the vehicle
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   or you'll have your license suspended, but
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.900]   you can purchase a storage policy. So the point remains that
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   you purchase a vehicle and then when you have the vehicle, you
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.900]   have to pay for car insurance. Then, of course, there are obvious
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   operating costs. If you operate the vehicle, you have to fill it with fuel, fill it
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   with oil. There are many maintenance costs. You need to rotate the tires,
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   replace the tires, change the oil. There are repair
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.900]   costs. When it breaks down, you have to continually repair it. And it's very difficult
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   to find a vehicle that isn't going to fall into disrepair
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.900]   if you just let it sit. One of the biggest problems that any kind of vehicle faces,
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, anything like that,
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.900]   airplanes, if a vehicle just sits, it rots.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   It's much better for a vehicle to be continually operating with fuel flowing
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.900]   through and other fluids flowing through all the rubber hoses and everything
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   being continually lubricated. You don't want to just let a vehicle sit ever or it quickly
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.900]   starts to rot and fall apart. And so these are all examples of
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.900]   continual expenses that you have with an automobile. And for many people
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.900]   these expenses are far out of whack with their overall budget, with their
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.900]   overall income. And in many cases, it's the automobile
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.900]   expenses that wind up sinking you and destroy your
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.900]   chances of getting ahead. I've had a love/hate relationship with automobiles
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.900]   for a very long time myself. And I have found that
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.900]   since I purchased my first vehicle in my teen years, it's been
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.900]   pretty tough to ever get to zero vehicles. My fleet has
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.900]   gone from one to, well, I think the most I ever owned at one
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.900]   time was five. And I tell you, the closer it gets to
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.900]   one, the generally happier I am. And someday, although
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   I haven't figured out how to do this with children, someday it's my ambition to be back down to zero.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.900]   So we'll see when I'm able to accomplish that.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.900]   But the point is simply that a vehicle, while it allows you to come
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   and go where you want to some degree, you incur
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.900]   significant financial bondage to that vehicle and it can
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.900]   wind up being a significant component of your overall expenses.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.900]   So a vehicle, a car, a personal automobile, doesn't fit the bill of the ultimate
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.900]   freedom machine, at least from a financial perspective. I would submit to you also that it doesn't fit
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.900]   the bill as the ultimate freedom machine from other contexts
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.900]   of freedom as well. For example, you're required to take care
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.900]   of the car wherever you go. You have to park it. You have to store it.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.900]   You have to figure out how to keep it from being taken from you, quite
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   literally. A number of years ago, I bought a vehicle in
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.900]   Europe and I had left Europe and I found
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.900]   a friend, a listener of the show, who was willing to store the vehicle for me and
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.900]   after a while the vehicle was stored. It was parked on a public street but the annual
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.900]   inspection sticker on the car expired because I hadn't been able to get back to Europe
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.900]   to renew it. And the police just pulled up a tow truck and trucked the car
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.900]   away and stole the car right off the street because I had not renewed the
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.900]   annual inspection sticker as the law stated. It took me
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.900]   quite a while to get it out of the police impound lot. And so you have to take care of it.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.900]   And if you're going to come and go among countries, you have to figure out what do I do with these cars?
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   How do I keep them going? How do I keep it from being taken by the police?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.900]   If you go into a city, a lot of times you have a vehicle and you want to travel into a city
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   but having a car in a city is really annoying. Where are you going to park it? You have enormous
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   parking fees. You go to a nice hotel in a city
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.900]   for a convention. Well, now I've got to pay parking fees for this automobile every day
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.900]   all day and I've got to make sure that it doesn't get taken in that
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.900]   context. And then even in terms of your overall personal
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.900]   freedom, a vehicle has the benefit of giving you some isolation
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.900]   from the environment around. You're not constantly on display
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.900]   but it also comes with significant legal costs.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.900]   One of the very few times in the United States that you can ever be forcibly
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.900]   compelled to show government identification documents is
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.900]   when you are driving a car. If you are driving a vehicle, then
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   the police have a legal right to stop you and compel you with a threat
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.900]   of force to display your personal identification documents.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   That is not the same, at least in most states. Not all states are the same.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.900]   That's not the same in any other context. And so you have to have government ID,
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   you have to carry government ID, and you have to produce government ID
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.900]   upon command. Oh, and by the way, if your government ID is
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.900]   invalid or your government ID is not accurate, let's say for example
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.900]   you moved three months ago and you haven't yet updated your address,
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.900]   your home address on your government ID, that is a crime and you can be
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.900]   prosecuted for said crime. And if you live in a police state like
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.900]   the United States where you can, they're out on the roads, that's where the police
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.900]   officers are, then that's generally where you're going to have contact with police
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.900]   officers. You don't have contact with them when you're in your private home, generally speaking.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.900]   You have contact with them when you are out in public. And driving around
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.900]   in your car causes you to be extremely vulnerable to search, to seizure,
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.900]   to all kinds of bad things that can happen. So on that
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.900]   dimension as well, a personal automobile doesn't fit the bill of the ultimate
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.900]   freedom vehicle or the ultimate freedom machine.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   So if we don't want to drive a car,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.900]   what are our options? Well, obviously we could just
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.900]   get our feet, we could just walk, or we could take a taxi, or we could do something else.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.900]   But I want to imagine a machine or a vehicle
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.900]   that would make up for some
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   of these downsides. And I would submit
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.900]   to you that the ultimate freedom vehicle is
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.900]   fairly obvious. It's called a bicycle.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.900]   A bicycle should be viewed as the ultimate
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.900]   freedom machine. And everyone
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.900]   should have one. Now, I'm going to tell you a specific
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.900]   type of one that I think you should have. But let's first
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.900]   talk about the bicycle generally.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.900]   Let's begin with a financial freedom machine.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.900]   Unlike a car or unlike public transportation,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.900]   a bicycle requires a one-time purchase
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.900]   with no ongoing monthly payments. I guess in theory you could pay for
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.900]   it with monthly payments, but most of the time a bicycle is accessible
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.900]   enough for you to simply pay for. That is an enormous
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.900]   benefit. You can purchase a machine, and that machine
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   is simply yours. Once you've come up with the initial purchase price, it's yours.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.900]   There are very few ongoing costs for
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.900]   a bicycle, and none of them are mandatory. For example,
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.900]   there is no insurance requirement for a bicycle.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.900]   You're not required to be insured, and so that eliminates a monthly expense.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.900]   There are no registration fees. Bicycles don't
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   have to be registered with anybody. They don't have to have a government
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.900]   placard on them. You don't have to pay the annual registration fees or the
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.900]   annual taxes like you do with a motor vehicle. The
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.900]   ongoing usage costs for
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.900]   a bicycle are limited to some basic maintenance.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.900]   There's of course no fuel costs, unless we want to count the calories that you need
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.900]   to consume to compel it down the road, but it's more than
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   that. Even the maintenance cost itself, a bicycle is a fairly simple machine,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.900]   can be fairly durable, and a little bit of mechanical knowledge and
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   a little bit of ongoing maintenance can keep it mostly running trouble-free.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.900]   So there's enormous benefits from a financial perspective
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.900]   to riding a bicycle. At its core though, it's important to just note
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.900]   that a bicycle massively multiplies your effectiveness as an
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.900]   individual. If you were a child, and you had a bicycle, and you were going to go over to your
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.900]   friend's house, there'd be very little chance that you walked to your friend's house
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.900]   if you had a bicycle available to you. Now I understand that the whole concept of childhood
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.900]   is changing for many people, but when I was a child, a bicycle
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.900]   was my ultimate freedom machine. It allowed me to come and go at a range of easily
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   10 miles around my house, not too difficult, and you could pretty comfortably
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.900]   ride for miles and miles on a bicycle without too much
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   difficulty. It's nice also that there's a bicycle available
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.900]   for every age. There are bicycles that are appropriate for 5-year-olds, and there are bicycles
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.900]   that are appropriate for 85-year-olds. When my grandmother was
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.900]   in her 80s, she had a tricycle, and she would go out, and that was her preferred form of exercise
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.900]   was to take her big tricycle out, and she would ride several miles up and down the sidewalk
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.900]   around our house and really enjoy her outdoor exercise. And so
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.900]   there's a version of a bicycle that's right for just about any age. And because
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.900]   there's no government requirements, and no legal registration, and no driver's
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.900]   licenses, they're available for anybody. Anybody who wants one, anyone
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   who needs one. You don't have to
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.900]   pass any test if your license was taken away from you,
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   and you don't have the privilege of driving now. You're free if you have a bicycle.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.900]   In addition to the lack of licenses, in addition to not having to
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.900]   carry government identification documents with you,
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.900]   you also have a higher level of independence based upon where you can
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   go with a bicycle. With an automobile, you are
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.900]   constrained to the roads and the existing car infrastructure.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.900]   But with a bicycle, you're not constrained to the roads. You can ride on the roads,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   you can ride on the sidewalks, you can ride on the grass, you can cut through the trees,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.900]   you can take all kinds of interesting routes from where you are to
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.900]   where you want to go. And you can do it fairly free,
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.900]   in a fairly free way, without really bothering other people, without really
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.900]   causing problems. In a moment I'll talk about electric bicycles.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.900]   One of the things that I most like about riding electric bicycles is it gives you all the freedom of a bicycle
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.900]   that you don't have with a motorcycle. Because while it's similar to a
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.900]   motorcycle in its ability to propel you down the road at a good rate of speed,
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.900]   you don't feel bad about sliding through a sidewalk, or cutting through a yard, or doing
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.900]   whatever you need to do to go where you want to go, where
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.900]   you would with a motorcycle. With a motorcycle I follow all the same rules as
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.900]   an automobile, because I don't want to inconvenience other people. With a bicycle,
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.900]   you're not inconveniencing anybody. And if you need to go on a place where
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.900]   pedestrian access only, walking access only, is the appropriate thing
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   to do, you just hop off the bicycle, walk it for a couple of minutes, and back on, and away
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.900]   you go. So bicycles are enormously freeing from a
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.900]   personal perspective. When you add to the ability of avoiding
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.900]   traffic congestion, come and go between the cars,
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.900]   you can oftentimes go faster in congested areas. You add to that
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.900]   the ability to find easy parking, you don't have to usually pay for
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.900]   bicycle parking. The freedom of it is enormous.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   In many cases, if you need to lock up your bicycle, you can lock up your bicycle, and as long
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.900]   as it's not stolen from you, you come back a week later, it's still sitting there. And you didn't
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.900]   incur a daily fee of $30 a day to park your car.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.900]   So these freedoms are real. They are palpable. They can
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.900]   be understood. They're significant. And then of course you add other
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.900]   benefits. The physical exercise, the fact that you'll probably feel better because
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.900]   you're moving your body, getting some sunshine, being outdoor, you probably have a better
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.900]   outdoors, probably a better mood overall. You're going to be really
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.900]   appreciating the bicycle as a freedom vehicle.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.900]   It is the ultimate freedom machine. The ultimate
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.900]   freedom machine that pays off enormously in terms of much lower cost per
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.900]   mile, can free you from the burdens of car ownership, and
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.900]   it can open up your lifestyle, allow you to come and go where you want to
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.900]   when you want to. Now, what are the downsides
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   of a bicycle? What are the things that,
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.900]   what are the reasons not everybody says, "Well, obviously
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.900]   a bicycle is the ultimate freedom machine, and that is the machine that I should
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.900]   obviously commit myself to." Well, there are a few that are
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.900]   pretty common and consistent. The first one that's
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.900]   rather obvious would be that a lot of cases
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.900]   it's just a long distance away. And if you have a
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.900]   25 mile daily commute to work and back, that's going to be a
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.900]   significant time commitment for you on your bicycle.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   When you compound that with the fact that many of us live in places with very
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.900]   poor bicycle infrastructure, where it's unsafe for us to
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.900]   ride on the public road, then now you start to
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.900]   think about, "How do I protect my life? How do I make sure that I'm actually physically
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   safe and I don't die on this thing?" Because one of the first rules of being free is
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.900]   not to be dead. So let's avoid unsafe places.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.900]   Avoid places with bad cycling infrastructure, if at all possible.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.900]   And let's be careful that we're not committed to excessively
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.900]   long rides. Pretty easy to ride 5 miles, not so easy to
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.900]   ride 55 miles. It's doable, but it's a much more significant investment
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.900]   of time. In addition, while a bicycle
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.900]   is easier to store, it's easier to deal with, the fact
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.900]   remains that it's kind of dirty, and it may not fit everywhere.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.900]   If you live in a small apartment, you don't have a bike storage facility at your
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.900]   apartment complex, where are you going to put your bicycle? Are you going to drive the thing inside?
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.900]   You can, but now it's hard to get in and out of the front door because you've got this big
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.900]   old bicycle sitting there. And then, what do you do if
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   the bicycle isn't appropriate? Meaning that
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.900]   what do you do if you can't quite reach it on the bicycle? Well, now
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.900]   you need an automobile, and you have to put a bike rack on the back or on the front
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.900]   in some way and transport your bicycle, and
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.900]   it's kind of a hassle. It's pretty much your choice
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.900]   to either drive or ride the bicycle in most cases
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.900]   because of the hassles of transporting a bicycle on the top
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.900]   of your car or on the back of your car where it's subject to the weather, vulnerable
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.900]   to theft,
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.900]   to damage, these kinds of things.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.900]   There are two solutions that have developed
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.900]   that I think are important for you to consider that solve many of
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.900]   these issues. Two solutions are
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.900]   e-bicycles, or battery propelled or battery assisted bicycles,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.900]   and folding bicycles. And I think
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.900]   the combination of these two solutions, either individual solutions or
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.900]   put together, is really magical. And that's where
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   I want to talk now for the rest of the podcast because when you put
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.900]   these two solutions together,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.900]   again, you create magic. Let's start with e-bikes.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   As battery technology has advanced and we have gained
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.900]   access to very high capacity batteries, powerful
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.900]   small electric motors, and we have developed
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.900]   battery technology that is much less expensive and yet has
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.900]   high capacity, we have been able to fit small electric motors
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.900]   to our bicycles and get an even more powerful
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.900]   machine. This was possible in the day and age before
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.900]   battery technology. Even around the world, there are small
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   motors that you'll see people fit to their bicycles that basically turn them into a small
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   sort of slow, loud motorcycle. But e-bikes
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.900]   are a real sweet spot. If you've never ridden an e-bike, I would
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.900]   urge you to go and ride one. If you have a friend who has one,
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.900]   go and do it. If you have a friend, if you have to rent one, go and do it.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.900]   Or just buy one and try it out. E-bikes are magical.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.900]   You can use an e-bike in various ways. But one reason many people
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.900]   don't ride a bicycle is they don't have the physical stamina to ride
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   for long distances at high speeds. Now that can be developed, but
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.900]   a battery-operated bicycle, a bicycle
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   with a motor, an electric motor and a battery, makes the bicycle
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.900]   much more powerful, which can help many people to use
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.900]   it who wouldn't otherwise be able to do it. The motor is
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.900]   enormously useful when facing hills. If your physical condition doesn't allow you
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.900]   to easily ride up hills, the motor will give you an assist that will make those hills
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   much more accessible to you. Something amazing is happening in education.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.900]   Students are inspired and engaged. That's because school districts
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.900]   consulted with CDW, who designed modern classroom solutions
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.900]   with pre-configured HP devices, making learning more accessible,
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.900]   secure and immersive. So when it comes to capturing student
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   attention, paper airplanes can't beat the lesson plan.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.900]   HP and CDW make amazing happen. Learn more
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   at CDW.com/HPPSG. It allows
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.900]   you to cruise along at a high speed with only a little bit of input from
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   your actual pedaling. And you can take rests when you need to and just
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.900]   simply let the battery do the work. And as I said earlier,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.900]   the power of an e-bike is that it's still a bicycle.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   It's not a motorcycle. It's a bicycle. So
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   you don't have the ultimate top speed. You don't have the ultimate
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   power that you would have with a full-fledged motorcycle. But
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.900]   you have all the benefits of the bicycle, but on
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.900]   turbo, on steroids, just really easy and really wonderful.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.900]   And so if you have a slightly longer commute and you say,
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.900]   "Ah, that would be uncomfortable to ride every day," or you have a very hilly commute and you're not
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.900]   conditioned enough to face it, or the places that you ride are just
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.900]   not awesome for a standard bicycle, then I would
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.900]   strongly encourage you, try out an e-bike. Today, the market
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   is awash in options. And they're fast, they're powerful, they're
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.900]   silent, they're inexpensive in many cases, just
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.900]   an amazing piece of technology that can really expand your
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.900]   horizons. So if there are issues that you're concerned with that are
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.900]   related to distance or to speed or to physical capacity,
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   an e-bike might provide a solution that will allow you
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.900]   to gain access to the ultimate freedom machine in a way that's
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.900]   suitable for you. The second set of issues
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   related to a bicycle can, in many ways, be solved with
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.900]   a folding bicycle. No doubt you've seen this at some point,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.900]   but if you've not looked at it deeply, then I would encourage you
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.900]   take another look at folding bicycles. Back to some of those issues
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.900]   that I described before. A bicycle is big. It's hard to transport
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   on your vehicle. You need a special rack. It has enormous wheels. Where do you put it
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.900]   if you don't have parking? What do you do if you need to integrate with something else?
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.900]   I want you to picture in your mind a bicycle that's just
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.900]   basically about that folds up into a package that's about the size of a
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.900]   carry-on suitcase. Quite literally a carry-on suitcase that you can take
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   on an airplane and stick in the overhead bin. You can purchase bicycles that are
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.900]   about that size and that are about the weight of a carry-on suitcase.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.900]   In many cases, much lighter. About 25-30 pounds. You can get them down to about
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.900]   20 pounds or less, but about 30 pounds is widely available.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.900]   And so a bicycle like this gets you the best of both worlds.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.900]   You can ride the bicycle whenever you want, but when it's inconvenient for you to ride
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.900]   the bicycle, you can just simply fold the bicycle up and take it with you.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.900]   If you want to get on and off a bus, you just grab the bicycle and if the front bike rack
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.900]   is full, you fold it up and you take it and you stick it next to your seat
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.900]   or in the bin on the bus. If you want to ride the train, you take it
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   and you stick it underneath your seat. If you want to ride the plane, quite literally, you can travel
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.900]   around the world with a folding bicycle that will either go as checked
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   luggage without excess bicycle fees or in some
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.900]   cases, be able to go into the overhead bin. If you want
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   to take your vehicle and you want to drive your own personal automobile,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   well if you have a bicycle in the trunk of your car, you now have the best of both worlds.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.900]   You can park in the place that's convenient for you, hop on your bicycle and finish the last
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.900]   mile or three miles in and out of the town. If you don't want
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   your bicycle to be sitting outside or in a public storage rack where it's getting dirty,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.900]   you just fold your bicycle up and you bring it in, you stick it in your closet.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   A folding bicycle is a marvelous invention. In my opinion,
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.900]   it is the ultimate freedom machine.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   Now you can integrate these things. You can get a folding bicycle that has
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.900]   battery power, it has an electric motor or you can get one that doesn't.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.900]   I would say that some version of this, as far as I'm concerned, is what I call
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   the ultimate freedom machine. You get every benefit and advantage
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.900]   of a bicycle and yet you take away the significant
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   majority of the disadvantages.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   Bicycles don't have to be one size fits all.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.900]   After all, we don't look at automobiles and say that one
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.900]   vehicle has to be able to do everything. We don't look at
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   automobiles and say that it has to be really fast, it has to carry ten people
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.900]   and it has to be able to haul a two ton boat. No, these are different
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.900]   vehicles for different applications, which is why we have small cars,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.900]   big cars, big SUVs, big pickup trucks, big vans, we have all
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.900]   of the above. And bicycles are similar. If you'll get out of your head the idea
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.900]   that one bicycle has to do everything and
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.900]   be open to building a stable of bicycles with different applications,
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.900]   then I think that you'll be able to put together the bikes that you
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.900]   need that will help you get all the benefits of a bicycle. But if I'm
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.900]   only going to own one bicycle, then my choice
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   is a folding bicycle. And I would encourage if you haven't
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.900]   looked into them to look into them. Here are some interesting
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.900]   applications of folding bicycles. The first one has to do
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.900]   with just simply world travel. If I could go back and be
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.900]   19 years old again and take a gap year, here is what I would do
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.900]   and how I would do it. I personally am not
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.900]   generally attracted to the idea of long
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.900]   range bicycle travel. I've read the stories of people that get on a
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.900]   bicycle and ride from Alaska to Argentina or go and ride from London
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   to Singapore and I think they're awesome. I've met people in my own travels
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.900]   who are doing this and I think it's a really cool way to travel the world.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.900]   After all, you have very low expenses, you
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.900]   interact with people wherever you're going because you're visible, you're public, you're part
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   of everything that you're doing. I think it's fantastic. It's a really, really great way
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.900]   of traveling the world. And it's never appealed to me. It's never been something
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.900]   that I have wanted to do. But I have admired the independence
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.900]   of bicyclists. Now I've been into overlanding. I've enjoyed
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.900]   overlanding myself and overlanding defined here is just the idea of
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.900]   taking your own personal automobile and driving it where you want to go. But the
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.900]   costs of overlanding are pretty significant. The cost of
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.900]   acquiring a vehicle, maintaining a vehicle. It makes travel out of sight for most
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.900]   people who are younger, who are getting established. So what most people do
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.900]   is they wind up using simply public transit.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.900]   Which is great. You can fly here, take a bus there and walk
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.900]   to your final destination. Public transit is really, really great.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.900]   Until it's not. Until the walk is really far. Until the transit
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.900]   is really annoying or it doesn't go where you want to go. And I think that the perfect
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.900]   travel accessory that is significantly underutilized is a folding
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   bicycle. Because with a folding bicycle you can outfit your bicycle
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   with the same basic gear and equipment that a
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.900]   long range bicyclist would use. You can have a small tent,
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.900]   small sleeping set up. There's amazingly experienced people that can give you advice
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.900]   on how to set it up. But you can do all that with a folding bicycle. And the folding
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.900]   bicycle allows you to take advantage of transit or
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.900]   transportation whenever you want to. So if you want to hop from one country to
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   another, you just pull your pack apart, pack up your bicycle, jump on an airplane
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.900]   and fly four countries away. Done. If you get bad weather
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.900]   and you don't want to be out in the bad weather, then you just post up at a hostel or a hotel
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.900]   somewhere. You fold up your bicycle, you bring it inside. You have perfect protection for
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   all your gear and you stay in a hotel or hostel until the bad weather passes.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   If the bad weather continues in the place that you are, well then you just hop on a bus
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.900]   and go a state over or a country over or go to the next solution.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.900]   Next place you want to go. If you want to go in
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.900]   and out of a city but you find that the expenses in downtown are
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.900]   pretty high and you'd like to be able to go in and out
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.900]   but be in that city but not stay downtown, the bicycle may be
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.900]   your ticket. You ride a commuter line out of the city center,
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   ride the commuter line out to one of the furthest stations, hop on your bicycle, pedal
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   a couple of miles further out into the countryside and set up a camp. You can camp
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   very inexpensively, probably for free, be completely unbothered by
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   anybody else because you're not in a highly built up urban area because
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   of the access to the train. Set up your camp there and then go
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   in and out using the commuter train into downtown New York City or downtown
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.900]   Tokyo or downtown wherever you happen to be going. And that
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.900]   bicycle gives you a much bigger range than you would have if you were on your
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.900]   feet. As far as I'm concerned, it's the
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.900]   two of these things together that makes a bicycle magical.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.900]   The multiplication of the fact that you can now go
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   miles and miles and miles on your bicycle very comfortably
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   but yet still have easy access to
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.900]   transportation options, to the bus, to an Uber, to a taxi
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.900]   and you don't need any special equipment. You can just place your bicycle in the trunk of the
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.900]   taxi. You can even do this with hitchhiking. You're going to hitchhike, you can put
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   your bicycle into the trunk of the person who's carrying you.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.900]   You don't need special bike racks. You don't need to only go with somebody who has a
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   truck. I think this is the best budget
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.900]   based travel option for people who want to travel
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   widely, extensively, inexpensively
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.900]   and putting these two things together is magic. The folding bicycle
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.900]   is a magical freedom machine. And remember
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.900]   if you want and gain benefit from the
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.900]   battery, you can have all those benefits as well. The battery adds significant
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   weight so it would be less likely that you would want to transport that battery around
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   on a continual basis. But it does allow you to get all the boosting benefits
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.900]   of an e-bike but in a small foldable machine. As far as I'm concerned
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   that's the ultimate travel setup, the ultimate camping setup for a budget
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   traveler that will allow you to go much farther than somebody who exclusively
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   has his feet to travel on and yet see much more interesting things
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.900]   than someone who is entirely dependent on transit, entirely dependent
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   on private taxis, private transportation because you have your own private
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   transportation. And the world is enormously open to you. If you can
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.900]   ride a public bus and then do the last 3 or 4 or 5 miles on your bicycle
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.900]   fairly quickly, you're going to have amazing travel experiences that
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.900]   are not open to anyone else. Another application I would like you
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.900]   to think about is that I believe that a bicycle is one
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.900]   of the ultimate preparedness items that you should have established
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.900]   for yourself. If you work away from your house
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.900]   you commute from your house to your office, one of your first
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   aspects of preparedness in terms of preparing for a disaster
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   scenario of some kind, should be to think about how you would
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   get from your job to your house if you weren't able to
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.900]   get there with the normal means and method. Imagine that you
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   work in downtown New York City, downtown Manhattan and you need
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.900]   to commute to your home in New Jersey or wherever it happens to be
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.900]   and then something happens that causes downtown Manhattan
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.900]   to be an entire jam. There might be a terrorist attack,
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.900]   there might be a power outage, a train outage, any number of things.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.900]   How are you going to get from your office to your home?
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.900]   Well, if you spend any time on YouTube as I do
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.900]   and you search something like "get home" you'll quickly find
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.900]   that everyone suggests that you have something called a "get home bag"
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.900]   which I think is a great idea. The idea is you should have in your office a bag
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   that has some basic supplies and provisions. It might include things like
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.900]   a comfortable pair of shoes. Maybe you wore fancy dress shoes to the office
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   today but you keep a comfortable pair of broken in shoes that are good for walking
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.900]   in your bag. You might have some extra food, some snacks, some water,
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.900]   a jacket or a coat so that you can just simply leave your office and you can walk home.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   But if you're settling in for a 10 or 15 mile walk
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.900]   that's going to take you a significant amount of time and be quite difficult for you to accomplish
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.900]   if you can't just take your car. Well, what is a machine
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.900]   that can multiply your efforts? The answer is a bicycle.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.900]   A bicycle can turn that 15 mile walk into something that takes an hour or two
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   and you're done. Instead of it being an all day affair for you to make that 15
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   miles home. And yet why doesn't everybody have a spare bicycle
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.900]   parked at his office or in his car? It doesn't fit.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.900]   The thing is big. Unless it's a folding bicycle. And so
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   if you are thinking and making a plan to get from your office to your home in a disaster
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   of some kind, then I would encourage you that a folding bicycle
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.900]   should be step number one. Every commuter who is
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   intelligent and forward thinking, even if you're using your car every day,
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.900]   the first accessory you should purchase for your car is a folding bicycle that goes in the
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   trunk. So if your car stops working or there's a terrible traffic jam
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.900]   and you can't get through in traffic or the bridges are shut down,
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   you open your trunk, you unfold your bicycle, grab your backpack with your
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   comfortable shoes and a little bit of extra snacks and water, hop on the bicycle and
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.900]   get yourself home where your family is. And then we have all the benefits
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   of a bicycle being able to come and go throughout traffic, being able to fold it up, jump on a plane,
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.900]   jump on, excuse me, hopefully not a plane, jump on a boat. And if you remember in a day
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.900]   like 9/11, there were all kinds of boats that were ferrying people from Manhattan
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.900]   to New Jersey using the boats. And so with your bicycle
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   you can take your bicycle on any form of transportation as well.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   And so at the very least you should have a bicycle at your office folded up, sitting in a
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   closet somewhere for you and/or if you're using your private car every day, then
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   you should have a bicycle in your trunk. If you're
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.900]   a commuter and you just always commute on the train or using transit of some kind, great!
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.900]   Keep a bicycle under your desk at work so that
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   if there's something happening with the trains, trains are broken, blocked, shut down,
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   non-functional, that you have an option to be able to get yourself home to be with those that you love.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.900]   Now in terms of specific brands and things like that to consider, I don't
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   have any particular insight for you. I would say that
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.900]   if you're just looking for one that is probably the best, the most
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   popular and the best seems to be a brand called Brompton.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   It's a British brand that
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.900]   has a very long-running design and they're a really good
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.900]   middle-of-the-road option. The price
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   for a Brompton folding bicycle, a new one, is probably going to be somewhere around $1,200
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.900]   to as much as $5,000 for a
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.900]   battery-operated, top-of-the-line, titanium, super lightweight, that kind of thing.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.900]   I've seen some guys that accessorize theirs to be a $10,000 bicycle,
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.900]   but basically looking at somewhere around $1,200 to $2,000
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.900]   for probably a pretty good Brompton brand new.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.900]   There are other ones, I think one of the largest ones globally is
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.900]   Eihon. Tern is another competitor, Montague,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.900]   Bike Friday, Riese & Muller, A-Bike, Oyama,
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   Citizen Bike. I don't know enough about this
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.900]   field to tell you the pros and the cons of all of them. I think
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.900]   again, your best straightforward one is Brompton.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.900]   If you're just looking for probably the standard, the high-quality
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   Toyota of the space, I think it's Brompton. Now, there
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   is another brand that probably makes the smallest one. I think that brand
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.900]   is Quiggle. So if you want a super, super compact one,
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.900]   then there's this one called Quiggle that is a German
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.900]   company that makes this tiny one that folds up into something
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   that's smaller than a carry-on, probably more akin to a personal
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   item size. It's not as rideable
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.900]   as a Brompton is, but it's certainly much smaller and
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   much more lightweight. So if the absolute smallest package
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.900]   is necessary for you, then I think that one is probably the absolute smallest.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.900]   Remember that all of this is a trade-off. If you were going to get set off and
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   ride from Alaska to Argentina and you wanted to never
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.900]   take transit and you didn't want any of the benefits of a folding bicycle, you wouldn't
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   ride a folding bicycle. You're riding a folding bicycle because it's not
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.900]   quite as good as a fixed bicycle, but it's almost
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.900]   as good and yet gives you all the benefits of the folding mechanism. And so
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   there's a range between large size
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.900]   and smaller ones, and there are less expensive ones
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.900]   available as well. There are a number of brands that are a good bit cheaper than Brompton,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.900]   but I'm not skillful enough to tell you that you definitely
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   should have this brand or that brand. You have to figure that out for yourself.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   What I want to emphasize to you is quite simply this.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.900]   Machines enhance our power and enhance our lifestyle
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.900]   and we should use them in every place that they
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.900]   make sense. Sometimes we just automatically accept certain
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.900]   machines and we don't pay attention to the downsides. So a personal
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.900]   automobile is a powerful and amazing machine that has a whole bunch
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.900]   of downsides. So let's pay attention to those downsides
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.900]   and not get a big machine or an expensive machine where we don't need
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.900]   one. And let's not try to make one machine do everything.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.900]   If you're looking for the ultimate freedom machine, the ultimate freedom vehicle,
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   it is a bicycle. It's not a car, it's a bicycle.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.900]   And the ultimate form of a bicycle that gives you
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   most 80 to 95% of all the benefits of a bicycle
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.900]   but gives you a whole bunch of benefits that the standard
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.900]   fixed bicycle form doesn't give you is a folding
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.900]   bicycle. And if you are looking for magic,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   look for one of those. Look for, if you gain benefit
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   from having an electric assist, look for an e-bike.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.900]   And if you have not paid attention to this marketplace, look
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   around and see if these new and really good technologies might help
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.900]   you to have an ultimate freedom machine that allows
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.900]   you to save more money, go more places, live a cooler and more interesting
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.900]   lifestyle, accumulate more interesting experiences without the
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.900]   heavy costs of other kinds of machines.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.900]   That's not just the sound of that
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   first sip of morning joe. It's the sound of someone shopping for a car on
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   Carvana from the comfort of home. That's a good blend. It's time to take it easy.
