[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.840]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.320]   Today, we are going to discuss salt,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.640]   also referred to as sodium.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.600]   Most of us think of salt
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.320]   as something that we put on and in our food,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.760]   maybe something to avoid,
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.780]   maybe some of you are actually trying to get more salt,
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.880]   some of you are trying to get less salt.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.440]   We all seem to associate salt
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.420]   with things like blood pressure, et cetera.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.840]   Today, we're going to go down
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.040]   a different set of avenues related to salt.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.320]   We will certainly cover how salt regulates blood pressure.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.840]   We are also going to talk about
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.960]   how the brain regulates our appetite for salt
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.220]   or our aversion for salt.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.520]   We are also going to talk about
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.440]   how our sensing of salty tastes
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.600]   actually mediates how much sugar we crave
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.360]   and whether or not we ingest more or less sugar
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000]   than we actually need.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.420]   So what you're going to learn today
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.460]   is that the so-called salt system,
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.440]   meaning the cells and connections in our brain and body
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.880]   that mediate salt craving and avoidance
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.500]   are regulating many, many aspects of our health
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.940]   and our ability to perform in various contexts,
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.280]   things like athletic performance,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520]   things like cognitive performance.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.800]   We're also going to talk about aging and dementia
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360]   and avoiding aging and dementia
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.480]   and what role salt and salt avoidance might play in that.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.840]   We're going to touch on some themes
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920]   that for some of you might seem controversial
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560]   and indeed, if they are controversial,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.480]   I'll be sure to highlight them as such.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.240]   I'm going to cover a lot of new data
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.940]   that point to the possibility,
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.960]   I want to emphasize the possibility that for some people,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.020]   more salt might help them in terms of health,
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.040]   cognitive and bodily functioning.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.400]   And for other people, less salt is going to be better.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.500]   I'm going to talk about what the various parameters are.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.720]   I'm going to give you some guidelines
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.200]   that in concert with your physician,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   who you should absolutely talk to
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.020]   before adding or changing anything
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.880]   to your diet or supplementation regime
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   can help you arrive at a salt intake
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280]   that's going to optimize your mental,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   physical health and performance.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.500]   So we're going to cover neurobiology,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.320]   we're going to cover hormone biology,
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.620]   we're going to talk about liver function,
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.560]   we're going to talk about kidney function
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   and of course, brain function.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.560]   I'm excited to share this information with you today.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.480]   I'm certain you're going to come away
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.040]   with a lot of information and actionable items.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.960]   I'm pleased to announce
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.340]   that I'm hosting two live events this May.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.800]   The first live event will take place
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.920]   The second live event will take place in Portland, Oregon
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.880]   on May 18th.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.320]   Presale tickets for these two events are now available
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.200]   at hubermanlab.com/tour.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.460]   I should mention that while I do hope to visit other cities
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.440]   in the near future to do more live events,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.500]   right now, these are the only two live events
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.960]   I have scheduled, at least for the next six months.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.560]   So once again, if you go to hubermanlab.com/tour,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.440]   you can access the presale tickets.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.320]   I hope to see you at these live events
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   and as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.120]   Before we dive into the topic of today's episode,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.760]   I want to highlight a really exciting new study.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.140]   This is a study from Diego Bohor's lab at Duke University.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.500]   The Bohor's lab studies interactions
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.840]   between the gut and the brain
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.200]   and has made some incredible discoveries
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.320]   of the so-called neuropod cells.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.840]   Neuropod cells are neurons, nerve cells
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.060]   that reside in our gut and that detect things
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.280]   like fatty acids, amino acids,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.360]   and some neuropod cells sense sugar.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.880]   Previous work from this laboratory has shown
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.220]   that when we ingest sugar,
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.840]   these neuropod cells respond to that sugar
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.280]   and send electrical signals up a little wire
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.740]   that we call an axon through the vagus nerve,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.920]   for those of you that want to know, and into the brain
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.000]   and through subsequent stations of neural processing,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.400]   evoke the release of dopamine.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.880]   Dopamine is a molecule known to promote craving
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.500]   and motivation and indeed action.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.620]   And what these neuropod cells that send sugar
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.140]   are thought to do is to promote seeking and consumption,
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.920]   eating of more sugary foods.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.560]   Now, the incredible thing is that it's all subconscious.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.060]   This is a taste system in the gut
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.560]   that is not available to your conscious awareness.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.320]   Now, of course, when you ingest sweet foods,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.880]   you taste them on your mouth too.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.040]   And so part of the reason that you crave sweet foods perhaps
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800]   is because they taste good to you.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   And the other reason is that these neuropod cells
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.280]   are driving a chemical craving
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.760]   below your conscious detection.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.360]   So they're really two systems.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360]   Your gut is sensing at a subconscious level what's in it
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.040]   and sending signals to your brain that work in concert
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.400]   in parallel with the signals coming from your mouth
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640]   and your experience of the taste of the food.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.440]   Now, that alone is incredible and has been the subject
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.180]   of many important landmark papers
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.580]   over the last decade or so.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.940]   You can imagine how the system would be very important
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.260]   for things like hidden sugars,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.580]   when nowadays in a lot of processed foods,
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.640]   they're putting hidden sugars,
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.060]   they're putting a lot of things that cause your gut
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.800]   to send signals to your brain
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.160]   that make you crave more of those foods.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.780]   So for those of you that really love sugar,
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.440]   just understand it's not just about how that sugar tastes.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.980]   The new study from the Borjas lab
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.940]   deserves attention, I believe.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.900]   This is a paper published just recently,
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.720]   February 25th, this year, 2022 in Nature Neuroscience,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.760]   an excellent journal.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.440]   And the title of the paper is the preference for sugar
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.520]   over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.960]   The Borjas lab has now discovered a neuropod cell,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.120]   meaning a category of neurons that can distinguish
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.120]   between sweet things in the gut that contain calories,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.840]   for instance, sugar, and things in the gut that are sweet,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   but do not contain calories.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.240]   Artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.780]   and so forth.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.700]   There are also, of course,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.780]   non-artificial non-caloric sweeteners like stevia,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.360]   monk fruit, et cetera.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.280]   They did not explore the full gallery
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.640]   of artificial sweeteners.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.440]   What they did find, however,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   ought to pertain to all forms
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.400]   of sweet non-caloric substances.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.860]   What they discovered was that there is a signature pattern
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.680]   of signals sent from the gut to the brain
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.040]   when we ingest artificial or non-caloric sweeteners.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.680]   This is important because what it says
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.260]   is that at a subconscious level,
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.300]   the gut can distinguish between sweet things
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.600]   that contain calories and sweet things that do not.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.400]   Now, what the downstream consequences of this sensing is,
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   or what they are, isn't yet clear.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   Now, I believe everyone should be aware
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.640]   of these kinds of studies for a couple of reasons.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.040]   First of all, it's important to understand
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.460]   that what you crave, meaning the foods you crave
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.780]   and the drinks you crave,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.280]   is in part due to your conscious experience
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.800]   of the taste of those things,
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   but also due to biochemical and neural events
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.560]   that start in the body and impinge on your brain
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.680]   and cause you to seek out certain things,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.000]   even though you might not know
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.560]   why you're seeking out more sugar.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.520]   You find that you're craving a lot of sugar
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.080]   or you're craving a lot of foods with artificial sweeteners
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.880]   and you don't necessarily know why.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   Now, artificial sweeteners themselves
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.340]   are a somewhat controversial topic.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.060]   I want to highlight that.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.800]   Some months back, I described a study from Yale University
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.760]   about how one can condition the insulin system.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.960]   Insulin is involved in mobilizing a blood sugar
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.840]   and so forth in the body, as many of you know,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.640]   and I described some studies that were done
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.400]   from Yale University School of Medicine,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.280]   looking at how artificial sweeteners
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.120]   can actually evoke an insulin response
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.000]   under certain conditions.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.760]   Now, a couple of key things.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.380]   I got a little bit of pushback after covering those studies,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.360]   and I encourage pushback all the time.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.440]   Pushback is one of those things that forces all of us
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.280]   to drill deeper into a topic.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.120]   I want to be clear.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.680]   First of all, I am not one to demonize artificial sweeteners.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.340]   There is evidence in animal models, in animal models,
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.240]   that artificial sweeteners can disrupt the gut microbiome,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.700]   but those were fairly high doses of artificial sweeteners,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.960]   and it's unclear if the same thing pertains to humans.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.360]   Still unclear, I should say,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.420]   has not been investigated thoroughly.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.580]   Some people don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.440]   Some people do.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.400]   Some people find that they really help them
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.440]   avoid excessive caloric intake.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   Some people believe, and yet I should emphasize,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.500]   there still isn't evidence
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.280]   that they can adjust the insulin response in all people.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.600]   I just want to repeat that three times
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.740]   so that people are clear on that fact.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.900]   What these new data emphasize, however,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.580]   is that we need to understand how artificial sweeteners
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.120]   are consumed at the level of the gut,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   or I should say, registered at the level of the gut,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.880]   and how that changes brain function,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.320]   because one thing that I'm familiar with,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.480]   and that many people report,
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.220]   is that when they first taste artificial sweeteners,
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.260]   they taste sort of not right to them.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.140]   They don't like the taste,
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.860]   but over time, they actually start to crave that taste.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.700]   I've experienced this.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.000]   I used to drink a lot of diet sodas
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.960]   when I was in graduate school, so this would be aspartame,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.700]   and I found that I actually needed them.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.780]   Now, maybe it was the caffeine.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.760]   Maybe I just liked the sweet taste or the carbonation.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.200]   We actually have a drive for carbonation,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.260]   which is the topic of a future episode,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.060]   but when I finally quit them,
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.400]   for reasons that were independent of any fear
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.600]   of artificial sweeteners,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.300]   I found that I didn't like the taste.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.420]   Nowadays, I only occasionally drink a diet soda.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.620]   I usually do that if I'm on a plane
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.900]   and there's nothing else available to me,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.260]   so I don't demonize them.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.180]   I might drink one every once in a while, no big deal.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.140]   I also want to be clear.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.100]   I consume stevia on a number of different supplements
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.460]   and foods that I consume.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.300]   Stevia, of course, is a plant-based non-caloric sweetener,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.540]   so I myself consume artificial sweeteners.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.860]   Many people hate them.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.440]   Many people like them and find them useful
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.460]   for their nutrition and in fact to keep their caloric intake
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.260]   in a range that's right for them,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.940]   and many people like myself are curious about them
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.860]   and somewhat wary of them
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.180]   and yet continue to consume them in small amounts.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.380]   I think most people probably fall into that category.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.820]   I should also mention that many food manufacturers
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.820]   put artificial sweeteners, such as sucralose, et cetera,
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.220]   into foods, and it's always been unclear
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.180]   as to why they might want to do that,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.220]   and yet we know that the sweet taste consumption,
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.600]   even if it doesn't contain calories,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.700]   can drive more craving of sweet food,
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.620]   so there may be a logic or a strategy to why they do that.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.300]   Again, a topic for exploration on today's podcast
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.160]   and in future podcasts because where we're headed today
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.800]   is a discussion about how salt and salt sensing,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.740]   both consciously and unconsciously,
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.860]   can adjust our craving for other things
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.300]   like sugar and water and so on.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.960]   So I want to highlight this beautiful work
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.800]   from the Morres Lab.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.340]   We'll put a link to the study.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.500]   I want to open this as a chapter for further exploration.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.060]   I like to think that the listeners of this podcast
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.960]   are looking for answers where we have answers,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.680]   but are also, I would hope,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.200]   excited about some of the new and emerging themes
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.540]   in what we call nutritional neurobiology,
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.920]   and indeed the Morres Lab really stands
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.400]   as one of the premier laboratories out there
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.020]   that's looking at how foods as consumed in the gut
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.800]   are modifying our nervous system, the foods we crave,
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.820]   and how we utilize those foods.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.360]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.020]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.880]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.700]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.720]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.340]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.020]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.340]   I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.640]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.100]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.900]   and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.160]   is that I find it to be the best way
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.560]   to ensure I get all of my vitamins and minerals
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.520]   and the probiotics I need.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.560]   I try and eat really well, but I'm not perfect about it,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.300]   and with Athletic Greens, AG1,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.720]   I cover any deficiencies I might have.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.120]   The probiotics are particularly important to me
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.880]   because as we've talked about on many previous episodes
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.800]   and we'll talk about more on today's episode,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.260]   the gut microbiome is supported by probiotics
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.440]   and the gut microbiome supports many biological functions
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.320]   important for immediate and long-term health,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.860]   things like immune system function,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.480]   things like the gut brain axis
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   and mood and appetite and so forth.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.520]   With Athletic Greens,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.300]   I make sure all of those bases are covered
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.480]   because of the probiotics.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.840]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.420]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.520]   to claim a special offer.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.020]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.400]   which make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.560]   while you're on the road,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.440]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.920]   Vitamin D3 is crucial for many aspects
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.720]   of our immediate and long-term health,
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.760]   and many people simply are not getting enough vitamin D3,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.120]   or the amounts they're getting are not optimal.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.400]   K2 is important for cardiovascular health
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.660]   and for calcium regulation.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.520]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.680]   you can claim the special offer,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.820]   the five free travel packs
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.560]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.320]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.760]   and none of the things you don't.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   That means it has salt, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.940]   so-called electrolytes, which are critical for neuronal
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.080]   function and a lot of other biological functions.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.200]   As I mentioned on the podcast before, I'm a fan of salt.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.420]   I believe in ingesting appropriate amounts of salt,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.560]   and by appropriate, I mean,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.720]   depending on what your background blood pressure
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.580]   happens to be, what your activity levels are,
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.800]   how much you sweat,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   what your cognitive and physical demands are.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.120]   Today, we're going to talk about how to determine
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.660]   what those needs are.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.360]   I'm always trying to stay on top of my hydration,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.440]   and as you'll also learn about today,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.600]   salt and water intake and hydration are intimately related.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.640]   With Element, I'm sure to get the potassium, the sodium,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.080]   and the magnesium that I need,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   and I do that in a great tasting drink,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.400]   and as I mentioned before, it has no sugar.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.480]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.520]   you can go to drinkelement.com,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.840]   that's drinklmnt.com/huberman
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.640]   to claim a free Element sample pack.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.140]   You only cover the cost of shipping,
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.520]   otherwise it's completely free.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.460]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.880]   to claim a free sample pack of Element.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.260]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.900]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.440]   to help you better understand your body
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.480]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.940]   I am a big fan of getting regular blood work done,
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.160]   and I've been trying to do it
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.440]   as much as I can afford for years.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.500]   The reason is that many of the factors
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.580]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.180]   can only be discovered from a quality blood test.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.080]   With most blood tests and DNA tests, however,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.180]   you get information back,
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.520]   but not a lot of information
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.320]   about what to do with those numbers.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.880]   So if something's in high or low range,
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.940]   you might get one or two generic recommendations,
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.720]   things that you could easily look up online,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.740]   but you're not going to get a lot of specific recommendations.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.620]   With Inside Tracker,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.680]   they give you a lot of specific recommendations
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.820]   as to lifestyle factors and nutrition factors,
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.380]   supplementation factors,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.000]   things you may want to add to your life
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.880]   or things you may want to delete from your life
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   in order to bring the numbers into the ranges
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.420]   that are best for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.900]   There's simply no replacement for these kinds of data,
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.980]   and your data are the most important data to you,
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.980]   and quality blood tests and DNA tests
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.220]   are the way to access them.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.640]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.200]   go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.320]   Okay, let's talk about salt.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.160]   Salt has many, many important functions
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   in the brain and body.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.200]   For instance, it regulates fluid balance,
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.680]   how much fluid you desire and how much fluid you excrete.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.160]   It also regulates your desire for salt itself,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.040]   meaning your salt appetite.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.020]   You have a homeostatically driven salt appetite.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.360]   I'll talk about the mechanisms today
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.280]   and make them all very clear.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.360]   What that means is that you crave salty things,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.460]   beverages and foods, when your salt stores are low,
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.760]   and you tend to avoid salty beverages and foods
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.320]   when your salt stores are high,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.880]   although that's not always the case.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.000]   There are circumstances where you will continue
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.560]   to crave salt, even though you don't need salt,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.880]   or indeed, even if you need to eliminate salt
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.740]   from your system.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.720]   Salt also regulates your appetite for other nutrients,
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.360]   things like sugar, things like carbohydrates.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.500]   And today we'll explore all of that.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.000]   Technically, salt is a mineral.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.480]   And I should mention that when I say salt,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.120]   I am indeed referring to sodium in most cases,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.860]   although I will be clear to distinguish salt from sodium,
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.040]   meaning table salt from sodium.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.020]   Most people don't realize this,
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.580]   but one gram of table salt
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.900]   contains about 388 milligrams of sodium.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.680]   So technically we should be talking about sodium today
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.520]   and not salt.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.980]   I will use them interchangeably
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.860]   unless I'm referring to some specific recommendations
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.300]   or ideas about trying to define your ideal salt,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.280]   AKA sodium intake, okay?
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.240]   So this is important.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.360]   I think right off the bat, a lot of people get themselves
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.740]   into a place of confusion
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.100]   and potentially even to a place of trouble
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.180]   by thinking that table salt in grams
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.840]   always equates to sodium in grams,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.900]   and that's simply not the case.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.920]   Today we're going to explore the neural mechanisms
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.600]   by which we regulate our salt appetite
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.780]   and the way that the brain and body interact
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.220]   in the context of salt seeking, salt avoidance,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.020]   how to determine when we need more salt,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.460]   when we need less salt.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.280]   We'll talk about kidney function.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.320]   We'll get into all of it,
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.080]   and we're going to do it very systematically.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.240]   So let's start in the brain.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.800]   We all harbor small sets of neurons.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.780]   We call these sets of neurons nuclei,
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.320]   meaning little clusters of neurons
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.740]   that sense the levels of salt in our brain and body.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.000]   There are a couple brain regions that do this,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.180]   and these brain regions are very, very special,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.760]   special because they lack biological fences around them
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.340]   that other brain areas have.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.340]   And those fences, or I should say that fence
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.460]   goes by a particular name,
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.680]   and that name is the blood-brain barrier or BBB.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.580]   Most substances that are circulating around in your body
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.540]   do not have access to the brain,
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.460]   in particular large molecules,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.500]   can't just pass into the brain.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.960]   The brain is a privileged organ in this sense.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.840]   There are a couple other organs that are privileged
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.180]   and that have very strict barriers,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.800]   very particular fences, if you will,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.980]   and those other organs include things like the ovaries
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.220]   and testes, and that makes sense for the following reason.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.300]   First of all, the brain, at least most of the brain,
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.000]   cannot regenerate after injury.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.500]   You just simply can't replace brain cells after injury.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.820]   I know people get really excited about neurogenesis,
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.940]   the birth of new neurons,
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.620]   and indeed neurogenesis has been demonstrated
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.420]   in animal models, and to some extent,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.480]   it exists in humans in a few places.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.420]   For instance, the olfactory bulb,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.840]   where neurons are responsible for detecting odorants
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.440]   in the environment for smell, that is,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.820]   and in a little sub-region of the hippocampus,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.780]   a memory area, there's probably some neurogenesis,
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.700]   but the bulk of really good data out there
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.400]   point to the fact that in humans,
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.660]   there's not much turnover of neurons.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.160]   What that means is that the neurons you're born with
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.580]   are the ones that you're going to be using
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.240]   most if not all of your life.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.260]   In fact, you're born with many more neurons
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.560]   than you'll have later,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.040]   and there's a process of naturally occurring cell death
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.380]   called apoptosis that occurs during development.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.420]   So you actually are born with many more neurons
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.340]   than you have later in life,
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.540]   and that's the reflection of a normal, healthy process
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.020]   of nerve cell elimination.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.100]   So the estimates vary, but anywhere from 1/3
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.440]   to maybe even 1/2 or even 2/3 of neurons,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.280]   depending on the brain area,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.040]   just going to die across development.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.160]   That might sound terrible,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.780]   but that's actually one of the ways in which you go
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.840]   from being kind of like a little potato bug
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.780]   flopping around helplessly in your crib
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.140]   to being an organism that can walk and talk
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.180]   and articulate and calculate math
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.540]   or do whatever it is that you do for a living.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.900]   So the brain has a set of elements,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.480]   these nerve cells and other cells,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.560]   and it needs to use those for the entire lifespan.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.200]   So having a BBB, a blood-brain barrier around the brain
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.100]   is absolutely critical.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.340]   The ovaries and testes have a barrier
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.840]   for we assume the reason that they contain
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.540]   the genetic material by which we can pass on our genes
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.780]   to our offspring progeny,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.620]   meaning make children and those children will have our genes
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.540]   or at least half of them.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.700]   The other half from the partner, of course.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:12.900]   If the cells within the ovaries and testes are mutated,
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.720]   well, then you can get mutations and offspring.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.080]   So that's very costly in the evolutionary sense.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.420]   So it makes sense that you would have
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.820]   a barrier from the blood.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.700]   So if you ingest what's called a mutagen,
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.040]   if you ingest something that can mutate the genes of cells,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.900]   you can imagine why there would be a premium
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.720]   on not allowing those mutagens to get into the brain,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.500]   the ovaries or the testes.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.940]   So the brain has this BBB,
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.440]   this blood-brain barrier around it,
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.180]   which makes it very, very hard for substances
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.040]   to pass into the brain unless those substances
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.140]   are very small or those substances and molecules
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.900]   are critically required for brain function.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.640]   However, there are a couple of regions in the brain
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.580]   that have a fence around them, but that fence is weaker.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.820]   It's sort of like going from a really big wall,
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.260]   thick electronic 24-hour surveillance fence
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.440]   where nothing can pass through
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.940]   except only the exclusive cargo that's allowed to go through
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.680]   to having a little cyclone fence with a couple holes in it,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.260]   or it's a kind of a picket fence that's falling over,
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.420]   and substances can move freely in from the blood
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.580]   circulating in the body into the brain.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.400]   And it turns out that the areas of the brain
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.820]   that monitor salt balance and other features
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.540]   of what's happening in the body
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.540]   at the level of what we call osmolarity,
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.100]   at the concentration of salt,
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.520]   reside in these little sets of neurons
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.420]   that sit just on the other side of these weak fences.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.780]   And the most important and famous of these
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.500]   for the sake of today's conversation is one called OVLT.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.300]   OVLT stands for the organum vasculosum
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.020]   of the lateral terminalis.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.660]   It is what's called a circumventricular organ.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.820]   Why circumventricular?
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.180]   Well, not to bog you down with neuroanatomy,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.820]   but your brain is a big squishy mass of neurons
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.840]   and other cell types, but it has to be nourished.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.560]   And through the middle of that brain, there is a tube,
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.860]   there's a hollow that creates spaces,
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.900]   and those spaces are called ventricles.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.780]   The ventricles are spaces in which cerebral spinal fluid
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.040]   circulates and it nourishes the brain.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.780]   It does a number of other things as well.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.500]   The circumventricular organs are areas of the brain
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.780]   that are near that circulating fluid,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.580]   and that circulating fluid has access to the bloodstream
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.220]   and the bloodstream has access to it.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.260]   And this structure that I'm referring to, OVLT,
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.420]   organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis,
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   has neurons that can sense the contents of the blood
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.140]   and to some extent, the cerebral spinal fluid.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.560]   There are a couple other brain areas
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.300]   that can do this as well.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.820]   They go also by the name of circumventricular organs.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.100]   And I'll talk about the names of some of those other areas.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.300]   But for today, and I think for sake
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.620]   of most of the discussion, understand that the OVLT
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.960]   is special, why?
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.700]   Because it doesn't have this thick barrier fence,
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.360]   which sounds like a bad thing,
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.440]   and yet it's a terrific border detector.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.340]   The neurons in that region are able to pay attention
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.860]   to what's passing through in the bloodstream
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.780]   and can detect, for instance, if the levels of sodium
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.260]   in the bloodstream are too low,
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.300]   if the level of blood pressure in the body
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.460]   is too low or too high, and then the OVLT can send signals
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.620]   to other brain areas, and then those other brain areas
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.700]   can do things like release hormones
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.540]   that can go and act on tissues
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.500]   in what we call the periphery in the body,
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.020]   and for instance, have the kidneys secrete more urine
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.380]   to get rid of salt, that's excessive salt in the body,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.780]   or have the kidneys hold on to urine
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.100]   to hold on to whatever water or fluid that one might need.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.020]   So before I go any deeper into this pathway,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.460]   just understand that the OVLT has a very limited barrier.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.380]   It can detect things in the bloodstream,
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.340]   and this incredible area of the brain almost single-handedly
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.220]   sets off the cascades of things that allow you
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.020]   to regulate your salt balance,
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.080]   which turns out to be absolutely critical,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.660]   not just for your ability to think
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.420]   and for your neurons to work, but indeed for all of life.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.320]   If the OVLT doesn't function correctly,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.700]   you're effectively dead or dead soon.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.980]   So this is a very important brain region.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.100]   So let's talk about the function of the OVLT
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.340]   and flesh out some of the other aspects of its circuitry,
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.300]   of its communication with other brain areas
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.160]   and with the body in the context of something
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.060]   that we are all familiar with, which is thirst.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.900]   Have you ever wondered just why you get thirsty?
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.340]   Well, it's because neurons in your OVLT
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.540]   are detecting changes in your bloodstream,
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.500]   which detect global changes within your body,
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   and in response to that, your OVLT sets off certain events
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.500]   within your brain and body that make you
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.060]   either want to drink more fluid or to stop drinking fluid.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.360]   There are two main kinds of thirst.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.860]   The first one is called osmotic thirst,
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.800]   and the second is called hypovolemic thirst.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.820]   Osmotic thirst has to do with the concentration of salt
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.200]   in your bloodstream.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.460]   So let's say you ingest something very, very salty.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.200]   Let's say you ingest a big bag of,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.840]   I confess I don't eat these very often,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.720]   but I really like those kettle potato chips,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.620]   and they're pretty salty.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.620]   I've never actually measured how much sodium is in them.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.720]   I'm sure the information is there.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.220]   Every once in a while, I'm particularly interested
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.400]   in doing so, I'll just down a bag of those things,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.320]   and I really like them, and they're very salty,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.500]   but they almost always make me feel thirsty,
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.920]   and the reason is that by eating those,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.280]   I've ingested a lot of sodium.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.500]   Again, not a frequent occurrence for me,
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.780]   but happens every now and again,
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.560]   and I don't have too much shame about that
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.900]   because I think I have a pretty healthy relationship
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.840]   to food, and I enjoy them,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.220]   and I understand that it will drive salt levels
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.500]   up in my bloodstream, and that will cause me to be thirsty,
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.460]   but why, why?
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.780]   Because neurons in the OVLT come in two main varieties.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.760]   One variety senses the osmolarity of the blood
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.880]   that's getting across that weak little fence
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.380]   that we talked about before,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.020]   and when the osmolarity,
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.360]   meaning the salt concentration in the blood is high,
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.300]   it activates these specific neurons in the OVLT,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.340]   and by activates, I mean,
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.160]   it causes them to send electrical potentials,
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.660]   literally send electrical signals to other brain areas,
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.620]   and those other brain areas inspire
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.920]   a number of different downstream events.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   So what are those other brain areas?
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.840]   Well, the OVLT signals to an area
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.320]   called the supraoptic nucleus.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.240]   The name and why it's called the supraoptic nucleus
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.940]   is not necessarily important.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.840]   It also signals to the so-called paraventricular nucleus,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.780]   another nucleus that sits near the ventricles
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:44.020]   and can monitor the qualities, the chemical qualities
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.500]   of the cerebral spinal fluid,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.320]   as well as probably the bloodstream as well.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   And the consequence of that communication
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.180]   is that a particular hormone is eventually released
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.680]   from the posterior pituitary.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.780]   Now, the pituitary is a gland
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.080]   that sits near the roof of your mouth.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.960]   It releases all sorts of things like growth hormone
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.180]   and luteinizing hormone, luteinizing hormone
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.860]   will stimulate things like estrogen
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.980]   and testosterone production and release
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.600]   from the ovaries and testes and so on.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.480]   The pituitary has a bunch of different compartments
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.580]   and functions, but what's really cool about the pituitary
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.500]   is that certain regions of the pituitary
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.460]   actually contain the axons, the wires of neurons,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.560]   and the neurons reside in the brain.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   And so the supraoptic nucleus gets a signal from the OVLT.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.400]   The signal is purely in the form of electrical activity.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.420]   Remember, neurons aren't talking in one another
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.760]   about what's happening out there.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.640]   They're not saying, hey, there's too much salt
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.460]   in the bloodstream, let's do something about it.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.840]   All they receive are so-called action potential,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.480]   waves of electricity.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.820]   The neurons in the supraoptic nucleus
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.020]   then release their own electrical signals
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.240]   within the pituitary and some of those neurons
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.700]   and nearby neurons are capable of releasing hormones
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.360]   as well as electrical signals.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.200]   So from the pituitary, there's a hormonal signal
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.960]   that's released called vasopressin.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.560]   Vasopressin also goes by the name antidiuretic hormone
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.760]   and antidiuretic hormone has the capacity
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.820]   to either restrict the amount of urine that we secrete
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.120]   or when that system is turned off
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.620]   to increase the amount of urine that we secrete.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.840]   So there's a complicated set of cascades
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.920]   that's evoked by having high salt concentration in the blood.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.240]   There's also a complicated set of cascades
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.600]   that are evoked by having low concentrations
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.200]   of sodium in the blood.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.180]   But the pathway is nonetheless the same.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.840]   It's OVLT is detecting those osmolarity changes,
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.680]   communicating to the supraoptic nucleus.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.340]   Supraoptic nucleus is either causing the release of
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.800]   or is releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.360]   or that system is shut off so that the antidiuretic hormone
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.480]   is not secreted,
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.240]   which would allow urine to flow more freely, right?
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.440]   Antidiuretic means anti-release of urine.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.720]   And by shutting that off,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.920]   you're going to cause the release of urine.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.720]   You're sort of allowing a system to flow, so to speak.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.960]   The second category of thirst is hypovolemic thirst.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.720]   Hypovolemic thirst occurs
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.800]   when there's a drop in blood pressure, okay?
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.540]   So the OVLT, as I mentioned before, can sense osmolarity
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.440]   based on the fact that it has these neurons
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.100]   that can detect how much salt is in the bloodstream.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.440]   But the OVLT also harbors neurons
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   that are of the baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.820]   Now, more on baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors later,
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.840]   but baroreceptors are essentially a receptor,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.220]   meaning a protein that's in a cell
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.540]   that responds to changes in blood pressure.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.760]   So there are a number of things
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.920]   that can cause decreases in blood pressure.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.200]   Some of those include, for instance,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.900]   if you lose a lot of blood, right?
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.600]   If you're bleeding quite a lot,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.240]   or in some cases, if you vomit quite a lot,
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.420]   or if you have extensive diarrhea,
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.800]   or any combination of those.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.680]   And there are other things that can reduce blood volume,
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.240]   and we will talk about some of those later.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.440]   But in the classic case of hypovolemic thirst,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   one is simply losing blood,
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.180]   and therefore blood pressure goes down.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.040]   So very simple to imagine in your mind.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.880]   You have these pipes,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.320]   which are the arteries, veins, and capillaries,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.240]   and when you lose some blood volume,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.420]   the pressure in those arteries, veins,
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.800]   and capillaries goes down.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.180]   OVLT has neurons that can sense that reduction
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.440]   in blood pressure because of the presence
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.280]   of baroreceptors in OVLT.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.400]   There are other elements that also play into the response
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.560]   to what we call hypovolemic thirst.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.400]   For instance, the kidney will secrete
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.080]   something called renin.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.720]   Renin will activate something called angiotensin II
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.280]   from the lungs of all things, amazing.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.120]   And angiotensin II itself can act on OVLT,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.300]   organ and vasculosin and lateral terminalis,
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.800]   which in turn will create thirst, okay?
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.420]   So in both cases, right, the osmolarity sensing system,
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.080]   meaning osmotic thirst, and in hypovolemic thirst,
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.800]   where blood pressure has dropped,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.700]   the end result is a desire to drink more.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.140]   And that desire to drink more comes through a variety
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.400]   of pathways that are both direct and indirect,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.800]   include vasopressin and don't include vasopressin.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.240]   But I think for just sake of general example,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.560]   and even for those of you that don't have
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.520]   any biology background or physiology background,
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.920]   just understand that there are two main types of thirst.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.060]   Both types of thirst, osmotic thirst and hypovolemic thirst,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.240]   are not just about seeking water,
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.660]   but they also are about seeking salt.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.480]   In very general terms, salt, AKA sodium,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.900]   can help retain water.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.100]   Now that doesn't mean that salt always retains water.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.920]   If you have excessive amounts of salt,
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.000]   will you retain excessive amounts of water?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.240]   Well, sort of, as we'll soon learn, it's all contextual.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.920]   But for most cases, we can say that
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.520]   by having salt in our system,
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.800]   our brain and our body can function normally,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.360]   provided the levels of salt are adequate
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.640]   and not too high or too low.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.200]   And thirst, while we often think of it
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.680]   as just a way to bring fluid into our body,
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.560]   is designed as a kind of a interoceptive perception.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.440]   What I mean by that, interoception, as many of you know now
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.360]   from listening to this podcast, is a paying of attention
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.040]   or a recognition, rather, a conscious recognition
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.440]   of the events going on within our body.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.080]   So when we are thirsty,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   it's a certain form of interoception.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.600]   We go, oh, I need something or I crave something.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.200]   You may not know exactly what you need,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.500]   but when you are thirsty, you're not just seeking water,
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.000]   you're also seeking to balance your osmolarity,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   which means you may be seeking salty fluids or foods.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.500]   In some cases, you'll try and accomplish this by eating,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.760]   or it may be that you're trying to avoid
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.640]   or you will be inspired to avoid salty fluids and foods.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.680]   But if you want to understand sodium
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.960]   and its roles in the body, you have to understand thirst.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.220]   And if you want to understand thirst,
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.280]   you have to understand how fluid balance
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.240]   is regulated in the body.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.280]   That's not surprising at all.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.520]   But sodium and water work together
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.600]   in order to generate what we call thirst.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.640]   Sodium water work together in order to either retain water
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.880]   or inspire us to let go of water to urinate.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.440]   So before we can dive into the specifics around salt
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.040]   and how to use salt for performance
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.420]   and various recommendations and things to avoid,
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.400]   we need to drill a little bit deeper
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.240]   into this fluid balance mechanism in the body.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.920]   And for that reason, we have to pay
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.180]   at least a little bit of attention to the kidney.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.680]   The kidney is an incredible organ.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.920]   And one of the reasons the kidney is so amazing
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.860]   is that it's responsible for both retaining,
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.420]   holding onto, or allowing the release
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.720]   of various substances from the body.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   Substances like glucose or amino acids, urea, uric acid,
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.140]   salt, potassium, magnesium.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.580]   It's basically a filter,
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.120]   but it's a very, very intelligent filter.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.480]   I mean, intelligent, meaning it doesn't have its own mind,
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.320]   but the way it works is really beautiful.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.480]   Basically, blood enters the kidney
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.620]   and it goes through a series of tubes,
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.300]   which are arranged into loops.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.560]   If you want to look more into this,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.120]   there's the beautiful loop of Henle
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.080]   and other aspects of the kidney design
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.460]   that allow certain substances to be retained
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.920]   and other substances to be released
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.260]   depending on how concentrated those substances are
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.100]   in the blood.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.560]   The kidney responds to a number of hormonal signals,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.200]   including vasopressin, in order to, for instance,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.540]   antidiuretic hormone, in order to hold on to more fluid,
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.020]   if that's what your brain and body need.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.760]   And it responds to other hormonal signals as well.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.960]   So it's a pretty complex organ.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.580]   Nonetheless, there's a key point,
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.580]   which I already mentioned
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.260]   that I think most people don't realize.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.180]   This is actually something that I like to tell kids
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.200]   when I meet them, provided that they're of appropriate age.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.040]   I'll say, oftentimes when kids learn that I'm a scientist,
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.480]   they'll ask a question about something related to science,
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.360]   and hopefully for my sake,
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.520]   it's something about neuroscience.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.280]   But one thing that I'll tell kids, I'll say,
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.760]   you know, do you know that your urine,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.160]   your pee is actually filtered blood?
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.480]   And occasionally that will really terrify a kid,
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.000]   but that also occasionally really terrifies an adult.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.480]   But indeed, your urine is filtered blood.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.140]   They see blood gets into the kidney,
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.800]   the kidney is going to filter out certain things,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.280]   certain things are going to be allowed to pass through
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.460]   and others are not, okay?
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:07.080]   So the way the kidney is designed is that about 90%
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.480]   of the stuff that's absorbed from the blood
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.460]   is going to be absorbed early in this series of tubes.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.760]   And only a small percentage is going to be regulated
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.240]   or worked out as you get into what's called
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.520]   the distal kidney.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.240]   Distal just means the furthest part away, okay?
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.500]   The proximal is up close.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.000]   So like your shoulder is proximal
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.840]   to your midline of your body and your hand is distal.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.000]   So in biological terms, you hear about proximal distal,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.320]   which just means near or far from.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.120]   So just to give a really simple example,
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.920]   let's say that you are very low on fluid.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.360]   You haven't had much to drink in a while,
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.420]   maybe you're walking around on a hot day.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:48.120]   Chances are that the neurons in your OVLT
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.300]   will sense the increase in osmolarity, right?
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.500]   The concentration of salt is going to be increased
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.140]   relative to the fluid volume that's circulating.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.180]   This of course assumes that you haven't excreted
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.280]   a lot of sodium for one reason or another,
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.880]   but that increase in osmolarity is detected by the OVLT.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.460]   The OVLT is going to signal a bunch of different cascades
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.580]   through the super optic nucleus, et cetera.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.700]   And then vasopressin is going to be released
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.000]   into the bloodstream and vasopressin,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.340]   again also called antidiuretic hormone,
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.460]   is going to act on the kidney and change
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.900]   the kidney's function in a couple of different ways,
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.200]   some mechanical, some chemical, okay,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.620]   in order to make sure that your kidney
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.880]   does not release much water,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.260]   doesn't make you want to urinate.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.300]   And in fact, even if you would try to urinate,
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.060]   your body's going to tend to hold on to its fluid stores.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.960]   Okay, so very simple, straightforward example.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.380]   We can also give the other example
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.820]   whereby if you are ingesting a lot, a lot, a lot of water,
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.780]   and it's not a particularly hot day
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.460]   and you're not sweating very much,
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.460]   let's assume your salt intake is constant
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.740]   or is low for whatever reason,
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.900]   well then the osmolarity, the salt concentration
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.300]   in your blood is going to be lower.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.580]   Your OVLT will detect that
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.800]   because of these osmosensing neurons in your OVLT.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Your OVLT will fail to signal to the super optic nucleus
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.820]   and there will not be the release
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.940]   of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.980]   and you can excrete all the water
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.180]   that your body wants to excrete,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.460]   meaning you'll be able to urinate,
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.740]   there's no holding on to water at the level of the kidney.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.140]   Okay, very simple examples,
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.840]   but hopefully it illustrates how events within the blood,
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.160]   meaning the concentration of salt
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.540]   relative to the amount of fluid, right?
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.360]   That's what osmolarity is, is detected by the OVLT.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.940]   The brain then communicates to the pituitary.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.100]   The pituitary sends a hormone out into the blood
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.220]   and the hormone acts on the kidney
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.380]   to either hold onto or let go of fluid,
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.040]   meaning to prevent you from wanting to urinate
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.120]   or from stimulating you to want to urinate.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.580]   Very, very simple kind of yes/no type situation here.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.540]   There's a lot of nuance to this in reality.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.100]   There are a lot of other hormones in this pathway,
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   but I think for at least this stage of the discussion,
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.300]   this should be sufficient.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.900]   Some of you may have noticed
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.340]   that a molecule we've been talking a lot about today,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.780]   vasopressin, was also mentioned on a previous episode
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:13.980]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.100]   but in a very different context.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.300]   The molecule I'm referring to is vasopressin,
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:23.300]   and as I mentioned, it's a hormone involved in anti-diuresis,
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.220]   meaning preventing urination.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.140]   It's an anti-diuretic.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.540]   But we also talked about vasopressin
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.740]   in the context of desire, love, and attachment.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.940]   We talked about it in the context of monogamy
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.180]   and non-monogamy in a species of animal
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.900]   called the prairie vole.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.860]   You can check out that episode.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.900]   I believe vasopressin and the non-monogamous prairie voles
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.660]   are mentioned in the timestamp, so it should be easy to find.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.660]   Vasopressin is made at multiple locations
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.740]   in the nervous system, mainly the super optic nucleus,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.260]   and indeed, it's also involved
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.180]   in aspects of sexual behavior and mating.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.700]   Now, it does that through mechanisms
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.940]   that are distinct from its anti-diuretic effects.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.860]   In fact, there are people who take vasopressin
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.460]   as an aphrodisiac.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.080]   Now, I'm certainly not suggesting people do that,
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.320]   but I have all the confidence in the world
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.820]   that the moment I talk about vasopressin,
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.920]   someone in the comments is going to say,
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.960]   "What do you think about vasopressin nasal sprays
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.160]   and this kind of thing?"
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.420]   Vasopressin and indeed oxytocin,
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.840]   another hormone that's involved in pair bonding
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.520]   and various aspects of brain and body function,
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.300]   are available as nasal sprays
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.240]   that can get up into the deep recesses of the brain
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.580]   and can impact some of these core,
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.080]   what we call hypothalamic functions,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.560]   these primitive drives and hypothalamic functions.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.720]   I would encourage a lot of caution,
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.500]   maybe even extreme caution in recreational use
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.700]   of things like vasopressin and oxytocin,
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.740]   unless you are working with an MD, excuse me,
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.840]   and they prescribe it or they really know what they're doing,
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.600]   these are powerful hormones
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.500]   that have a lot of different effects on the brain and body.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.860]   The way that vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone,
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.820]   prevents the release of fluid as urine from the body
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.080]   is pretty interesting.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.200]   It acts directly on the kidney.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.700]   So as I mentioned before, blood flows into the kidney,
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.020]   a number of things are retained
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.860]   in the early part of the kidney.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.540]   Vasopressin acts at a fairly distal,
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.920]   meaning kind of end game,
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.020]   part of the loops of tubes through the kidney,
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.420]   and it increases the permeability of those tubes.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.480]   In other words, it makes sure that the fluid
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.320]   that would otherwise pass into a collecting duct
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.580]   and then go out to the bladder
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.940]   never actually makes it to the bladder.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.940]   I point this out because what antidiuretic hormone does
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.120]   is it prevents the bladder from filling at all.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.340]   It's not as if it locks fluid in the bladder
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.860]   and prevents you from urinating.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.060]   I think the way I've been describing things up until now
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.980]   and the way you'll hear about antidiuretic hormone,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.380]   it might sound like it kind of locks up the bladder,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.200]   prevents you from being able to urinate,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.140]   but you have a full bladder.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.180]   That would be very uncomfortable.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.420]   That's not the way it works.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.380]   It actually causes the tubes headed towards the bladder
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.340]   from the kidney to become permeable,
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.340]   meaning to allow fluid to go back into the bloodstream
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.300]   into the rest of the body
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.220]   so that fluid never actually fills the bladder
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.400]   and so you never feel the urge to urinate.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.180]   Now, this is an episode about salt.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.920]   A key thing to understand about the kidney
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.380]   is that the kidney uses sodium in order to conserve water,
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.380]   which has everything to do with the fact
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.380]   that sodium can actually hold water, put differently,
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.660]   water tends to follow sodium.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.540]   So where we have sodium, we tend to have water
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.380]   and sodium, when it's concentrated, can hold onto water.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.780]   And that's one of the main ways
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.260]   that the kidney holds onto water in the body.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.220]   And as we'll soon learn,
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.060]   there is no simple and direct formula to say,
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.900]   for instance, okay, if salt levels are high,
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.660]   a lot of water is retained.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:04.220]   And if salt levels are low, a lot of water is released.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.300]   On the one hand, that can be true,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.820]   but it's also the case because these systems are homeostatic,
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.820]   meaning they're always seeking balance,
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.020]   both within system, within the salt system
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.940]   and between systems, the salt and water system,
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.940]   it's also the case often that if we have enough sodium,
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.940]   well, then we can secrete sodium and some water will follow.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.460]   Or if we don't have enough sodium,
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:33.220]   then yes, indeed, because we're not holding onto water,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.320]   more fluid can be excreted.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.780]   But if that condition of low sodium lasts long enough,
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.280]   then we start to retain water
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.260]   because the body recognizes, ah, salt is low
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.100]   and water is being excreted.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.300]   And eventually a system will kick in to retain water.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.000]   So I'd love to give you a simple black and white,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.420]   yes or no answer for low sodium, high sodium,
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.900]   moderate sodium and water balance, but it's all contextual.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.300]   And when I say contextual, I mean,
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.800]   it will depend on blood pressure, hypertension,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.580]   prehypertension if that's there, maybe normal tension,
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:10.300]   hormone levels, exercise, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.580]   A pretty good example of how complicated this can all be
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.140]   is one that some of you may be familiar with.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.180]   It's pretty well known that during certain phases
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.340]   of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.120]   and other hormones are fluctuating,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.140]   that water can be retained in the body.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.480]   There's, it's what's called edema or a swelling sometimes.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.820]   So the common assumption, and indeed it can be true,
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.800]   that when estrogen levels are high,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.640]   there's water retention in the body.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.800]   Also in males, if estrogen levels are high,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.240]   there can be water retention in the body.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.060]   This is one of the reasons why athletes
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.700]   and in particular bodybuilders who take anabolic steroids
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.300]   like testosterone, which can be converted into estrogens,
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.820]   sometimes they'll look, they'll walk around,
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.380]   they look like they were partially inflated,
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.540]   they look like they're going to pop,
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.660]   and it looks like a swelling of the skin,
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.120]   not just because they have large muscles.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.140]   And that's not always, but often water retention
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.460]   due to testosterone conversion into estrogen.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.860]   Now that all sounds consistent, right?
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.300]   Estrogen levels fluctuated in the menstrual cycle,
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.220]   in males where there's an increase in estrogen,
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.520]   there's retention of water,
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.820]   but actually estrogen acts as a diuretic.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.300]   So one would think, okay, when estrogen levels go up,
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.180]   there should be a lot of fluid excreted.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.260]   But I bring up this example to point out
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.560]   that it's a very complicated and dynamic balance
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.880]   between hormones and salt and fluid.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.520]   You can't draw a one-to-one relationship there.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.760]   And that turns out to be a very important point.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.040]   And we can use that not as a way
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.420]   to further complicate things,
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.180]   but as a way to understand under which context
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.260]   less sodium intake or more sodium intake can be beneficial.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.260]   So that's where I'd like to turn our attention now.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.660]   So how much salt do we need and what can we trust
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.240]   in terms of trying to guide our ingestion of salt?
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.340]   First of all, I want to be very, very clear
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.520]   that there are a number of people out there
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.500]   that have pre-hypertension or hypertension.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.340]   You need to know
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.500]   if you have pre-hypertension or hypertension.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.180]   You need to know if you have normal tension,
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.880]   meaning normal blood pressure.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.560]   Everyone should know their blood pressure
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.500]   is an absolutely crucial measurement
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.420]   that has a lot of impact
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.360]   on your immediate and long-term health outcomes.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.420]   It informs a lot about what you should do.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.580]   Should you be doing more cardiovascular exercise?
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.240]   Should you be ingesting more or less salt?
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.740]   Should you be adjusting any number
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.340]   of different lifestyle factors?
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.740]   So you need to know that.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.340]   And without knowing what your blood pressure is,
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.420]   I can't give a one-size-fits-all recommendation.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.800]   And indeed, I'm not going to give medical recommendations.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.940]   I'm simply going to spell out what I know about the research,
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.300]   which hopefully will point you in the direction
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.940]   of figuring out what's right for you
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.500]   in terms of salt and indeed fluid intake.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.980]   There is a school of thought
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.380]   that everybody is consuming too much salt.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.520]   And I do want to highlight the fact that there are dozens,
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.860]   if not hundreds of quality papers that point to the fact
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:01.460]   that a quote unquote high salt diet
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.500]   can be bad for various organs and tissues in the body,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.580]   including the brain.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:11.540]   It just so happens that because fluid balance,
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.260]   both inside and outside of cells is crucial,
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.840]   not just for your heart and for your lungs
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.300]   and for your liver and for all the organs of your body,
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.820]   but also for your brain,
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.820]   that if the salt concentration inside of cells in your brain
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.740]   becomes too high, neurons suffer, right?
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.020]   They will draw fluid into those cells
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.260]   because water tends to follow salt, as I mentioned before,
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.940]   and those cells can swell.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.180]   You can literally get swelling of brain tissue.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.440]   Conversely, if salt levels are too low inside of cells
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.000]   in any tissue of the body, but in the brain included,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.840]   then the cells of the body and brain can shrink
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:59.320]   because water is pulled into the extracellular space
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.560]   away from cells.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.040]   And indeed under those conditions,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.260]   brain function can suffer.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.000]   And indeed the overall health of the brain can suffer.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.840]   So there are many reports out there
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.700]   indicating both in experimental models
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.360]   and to some extent in humans
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.200]   that overconsumption of salt
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.720]   is bad for brain function and longevity.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.000]   And yet there is also decent evidence
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.020]   in both animal models and humans
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.200]   that if salt consumption is too low,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.220]   then brain health and longevity will suffer
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.880]   as will other organs and tissues of the body.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.380]   So like most things in biology,
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.720]   you don't want things too high or too low.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.100]   Now, I would say that the vast majority of studies out there
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.420]   point to the fact that a high salt diet
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.500]   is detrimental to brain health and function.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.060]   Most of the studies have focused on that aspect
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.440]   of salt balance and its consequences on brain function.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.940]   One critical issue with many of those studies, however,
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.120]   is that the high salt diet is often coupled
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.820]   to other elements of diet that are also unhealthy.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.720]   Things like excessively high levels of carbohydrates
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.040]   or fats or combinations of carbohydrates and fats.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.440]   And so while I know there are many burning questions
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.840]   out there about how much salt one needs
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.920]   if they are on a low carbohydrate diet
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.260]   or if they are fasting or if they are on a vegan diet,
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.860]   there have simply not been many studies
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.480]   that have explored the low, moderate,
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.420]   and high salt conditions
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.280]   on a backdrop of very controlled nutrition.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.400]   And that's probably reflective of the fact
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.000]   that there are not a lot
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.200]   of very well-controlled nutrition studies out there.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.960]   There are some, of course,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.080]   but it's very hard to get people to adhere
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.400]   to nutritional plans in a very strict way
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.960]   and to do that for sufficient periods of time
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.600]   that would allow the various health outcomes to occur.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.360]   Nonetheless, there's some interesting reports
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.920]   that indicate that the amount of salt intake
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:03.360]   can indeed predict health outcomes
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.320]   or what we call hazardous events,
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.200]   things like cardiovascular events and stroke and so forth.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.760]   And what's interesting is that indeed a lower,
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.480]   I'm not saying low, right?
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.800]   Because I don't believe that you want your diet
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.040]   to be truly low in anything except perhaps poison,
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   but a lower salt diet can reduce the number
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.680]   of these so-called hazardous events,
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.940]   but it's a somewhat of a shallow U-shaped function
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:37.940]   such that yes, indeed, a high salt intake
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.900]   can be very detrimental for your health,
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.620]   both in terms of cardiovascular events,
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.200]   stroke and other deleterious health events,
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.460]   but somewhere in the middle that actually sits
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.400]   quite to the right, meaning higher
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.800]   than what is typically recommended for salt intake
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.760]   can actually reduce the number of these hazardous events.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.920]   At least some reports point to that.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.120]   And so I want to emphasize
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.640]   what one of those particular reports says,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.540]   and I also want to be sure to counter it
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.800]   from the perspective of the context
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.880]   that that study was set in.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.040]   Because again, my goal here is not to give you
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.060]   a strict set of recommendations at all,
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.040]   is to point you to the literature,
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.880]   try and make that literature as clear as possible
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.920]   and allow you to evaluate for yourself.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.600]   And I don't just say that to protect us,
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.720]   I say that to protect you because indeed you are responsible
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.560]   for your health and your health choices.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.600]   So the paper that I'm referring to
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.320]   is a very interesting one.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.920]   We of course never want to put too much weight
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.440]   on any one report, but this is a paper
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.400]   that was published in 2011
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.900]   in the journal of the American Medical Association.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.340]   The title of the paper is urinary sodium
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.020]   and potassium excretion and a risk of cardiovascular events.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.460]   We have not talked much about potassium yet,
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.580]   but sodium and potassium tend to work in concert
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.820]   in the brain and body in order to regulate
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.540]   various physiological functions and health.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.340]   And we'll talk more about potassium as time goes on.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:05.340]   The key plot or set of data in this study,
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.740]   for those of you that want to look it up,
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.440]   we will link to it.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.080]   And there are a lot of data in here,
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.200]   but is figure one, which is basically evaluating
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.260]   the amount of urinary excretion of sodium,
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.360]   which is a somewhat indirect,
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.200]   but nonetheless valuable measure
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.300]   of how much sodium people were ingesting.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.220]   And plotted against that is what they call the hazard ratio.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:32.040]   And the hazard ratio points to the composite
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.240]   of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction,
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.940]   and an infarct as an injury and hospitalization
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.860]   for congestive heart failure.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.640]   And what it points to is the fact that the hazard ratio
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.640]   is low-ish at sodium excretion of about two grams per day,
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.920]   but then continues to go down
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   until about 4.5 to five grams per day.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.840]   Remember, this is sodium excretion,
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.840]   so it's reflective of how much sodium was in the body,
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.120]   which is reflective of how much sodium was ingested.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.080]   And then the hazard ratio increases fairly dramatically,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.800]   a very steep slope,
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.520]   heading anywhere from seven to eight to 10
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.120]   and out towards 12 grams of sodium excretion per day.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.600]   So the simplest way to interpret these data
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.800]   are that at fairly low levels of sodium,
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.640]   meaning at about two grams per day,
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.920]   you run fewer health risks,
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.880]   but the number of risks continues to decline
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.520]   as you move towards four and five grams per day.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.560]   And then as you increase your salt intake further,
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.840]   then the risk dramatically increases.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.080]   So no study is holy,
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.780]   nor is any figure in any study
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.760]   or any collection of studies holy.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.280]   Rather, we always want to look at
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.640]   what the bulk of data in a particular field reveal.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.900]   Nonetheless, I think that the plot that we described,
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.560]   meaning the graph that we described is pretty interesting
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   in light of the 2020 to 2025 dietary recommendations
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.100]   for Americans, which is that people consume
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.760]   no more than 2.3 grams,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.480]   meaning 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   That's about a half a teaspoon of salt per day.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:22.360]   Now, most people are probably consuming more than that
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.380]   because of the fact that they are ingesting processed foods
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.640]   and processed foods tend to have more salt in them
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.780]   than non-processed foods.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.000]   Now, of course, that's not always the case, right?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.460]   Sea salt is not a processed food in most cases.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:39.120]   And there are a lot of unprocessed foods
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.040]   that can be high in sodium,
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.780]   but processed foods in particular
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.780]   tend to have a lot of sodium.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.360]   You can see this simply by looking at the packaging
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.080]   of any number of different foods.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.840]   But if we were to take this number of 2.3 grams,
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.720]   that's the recommended cutoff
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.400]   for ingestion of sodium.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:01.060]   It actually falls in a portion of the curve
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.780]   that we were talking about a moment ago
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.780]   that indeed is associated with low incidents
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.380]   of hazardous outcomes, cardiovascular events,
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.740]   stroke, et cetera.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.320]   But according to that plot,
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:19.400]   the ingestion of four or five grams of sodium,
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   almost double or more sodium than is currently recommended,
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:29.280]   is associated with even lower numbers of hazardous events.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.640]   So we need to think about this
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.480]   and we need to explore it in the context
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.500]   of other studies, of course.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.920]   And we need to evaluate it in terms of this thing
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.360]   that we've been going back to again and again,
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.360]   which is context, right?
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.540]   These recommendations of 2.3 gram per day cutoff
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.200]   is in the context of a landscape
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.360]   where some people do indeed have hypertension
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.460]   or pre-hypertension.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.760]   The incidence of hypertension has gone up dramatically
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:00.080]   in the last 100 years and seems to continue to go up.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:04.560]   Whether or not that's because of increased salt intake
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.280]   or whether or not it's because of increased salt intake
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.380]   and other things such as highly processed foods,
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.260]   that isn't clear.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.120]   Again, pointing to the challenge
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.880]   in doing these epidemiological studies
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.820]   and really parsing what aspects of a change
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.880]   in some health metric is due to, for instance,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.080]   the ingestion of more sugars versus more salts
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.720]   or simply because of the ingestion of more salts.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:29.380]   It's a complicated, almost barbed wire topic by now,
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.520]   but we can start to pull apart that barbed wire tangle
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.560]   and start to evaluate some of the other people
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.520]   in other conditions that exist out there, maybe for you,
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.760]   that actually warrant more sodium intake
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.680]   and where more sodium intake might actually be beneficial.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.600]   So again, I want to be very, very clear
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.120]   that you need to know your blood pressure.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.820]   If you have high blood pressure or you're pre-hypertensive,
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.140]   you should be especially cautious about doing anything
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.140]   that increases your blood pressure.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.380]   And as always, you want to, of course, talk to your doctor
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.300]   about doing anything that could adjust your health
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.660]   in any direction.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.700]   But nonetheless, there are some important papers
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.180]   that have been published in recent years.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.100]   I want to point to one of them in particular.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.340]   This is a paper that was published
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.940]   in the journal Autonomic Neuroscience, Basic and Clinical,
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.460]   because this paper, like several other papers,
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.700]   ask the question, and indeed they ask the question
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.580]   in the title, it's a review, dietary sodium and health,
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.620]   how much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders?
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.740]   Now, orthostatic disorders come in a bunch
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.580]   of different varieties, and we're going to talk about those
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:35.240]   in a moment, but there are a number of people out there
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.380]   that have low blood pressure, right?
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.960]   People that get dizzy when they stand up,
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.780]   people that are feeling chronically fatigued,
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.500]   and in some cases, not all, those groups can actually benefit
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.620]   from increasing their sodium intake.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:51.220]   Several episodes ago on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.020]   I gave it what, it's just clearly what we call anecdata,
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.260]   which is not even really data, it's just anecdotal data,
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:02.220]   of an individual who was always feeling hungry
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.900]   and craving sugar, and based on the fact
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.480]   that they also had low blood pressure,
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.080]   I had them talk to a physician and they got permission
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.980]   to try a little mini experiment on themselves,
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.020]   and so they did, and that mini experiment was,
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:17.640]   anytime they felt like they were craving sugar
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.400]   or they were feeling a little lightheaded and dizzy,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.120]   rather than reaching for something with caloric intake,
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.440]   they took a little bit of sea salt,
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.600]   a little pinch of sea salt, and put it into some water
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.660]   and drank it, or in the case of this individual,
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.260]   they would actually take a little sea salt packet
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.080]   and they would actually just down a sea salt packet,
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.720]   and for them, that provided tremendous relief
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.360]   for their dizziness, but that, of course,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.680]   was in the context of somewhat abnormally low blood pressure,
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.200]   so I don't think that they are alone in the fact
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.840]   that many people out there suffer
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.980]   from a low blood pressure condition, many people out there
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.720]   suffer from a high blood pressure condition,
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.760]   so know your blood pressure and understand
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.720]   that blood pressure in part is regulated
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.420]   by your sodium intake and your sodium balance, why?
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.840]   Well, because of the osmolarity of blood
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.360]   that we talked about before,
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:09.840]   where if you have a certain concentration of sodium,
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.140]   meaning sufficient sodium in your bloodstream,
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.960]   that will tend to draw water into the bloodstream
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.160]   and essentially the pipes that are your capillaries,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.600]   arteries, and veins will be full,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.520]   the blood pressure will get up to your head,
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.880]   whereas some people, their blood pressure is low
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.040]   because the osmolarity of their blood is low,
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.920]   and that can have a number of downstream consequences,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.360]   I should also mention it can be the consequence itself
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.120]   of challenges or even deficits in kidney function,
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.320]   but all of these organs are working together,
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.880]   so the encouragement here is not necessarily
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.200]   to ingest more sodium, it's to know your blood pressure
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.840]   and to address whether or not an increase in sodium intake
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.080]   would actually benefit your blood pressure
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.680]   in a way that could relieve some of the dizziness
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.540]   and other symptoms of things like orthostatic disorders,
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.780]   but of course, to do that in a safe context
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.920]   and to never play games with your blood sugar
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.320]   or your blood osmolarity that could set your system
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.180]   down a cascade of negative events,
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.960]   let's look at what the current recommendations are
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   for people that suffer from orthostatic disorders
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   like orthostatic hypo, meaning too low tension,
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.240]   orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome,
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.220]   sometimes referred to as POTS, P-O-T-S,
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.800]   or idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and SYNCOPE,
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.040]   these have the incredibly elaborate names,
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.200]   those groups are often told to increase their salt intake
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.720]   in order to combat their symptoms,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.560]   the American Society of Hypertension recommends
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.480]   anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000, these are very high levels,
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.820]   so this is six grams to 10 grams of salt per day,
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:50.820]   keeping in mind, again, that salt is not the same as sodium,
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.560]   so that equates to about 2,400 to 4,000 milligrams
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.300]   of sodium per day, again, if you want to learn more
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.160]   about this and get more of the citations,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.140]   I'll refer you back to this study on dietary sodium
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.320]   and health, how much is too much
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.640]   for those with orthostatic disorders,
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.720]   we will put a link to this in the caption show notes,
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.660]   so that's not just in the US, the salt recommendations
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.660]   from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.980]   are 10,000 milligrams of salt per day,
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.120]   so four grams of sodium is what that equates to,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.480]   and on and on and on for things like POTS
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.280]   for these postural syndromes that result from,
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.080]   or I should say from the syndromes
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.140]   that involve low blood pressure when people stand up
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.800]   or in certain postures, so I point out this paper
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   and I point out these higher salt recommendations
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   to emphasize, again, that context is vital, right?
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.060]   That people with high blood pressure are going to need
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.860]   certain amounts of salt intake,
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.280]   people with lower blood pressure,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.740]   and maybe with some of these postural orthostatic syndromes
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.100]   are going to need higher amounts of salt,
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.660]   and for most people out there,
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.180]   you're going to need to evaluate how much salt intake
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.960]   is going to allow your brain and body to function optimally,
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.640]   and there are some fairly straightforward ways
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.220]   to explore that, and there's some ways to explore that
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.220]   in the context of what you already know
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.260]   about thirst and salt appetite that can make
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.820]   that exploration one in which it's not going
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.000]   to be a constant wandering around in the dark
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.240]   and where you can figure out what's right for you.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.520]   For most people, a moderate increase in salt intake
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.540]   is not going to be detrimental provided
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:28.540]   that you consume enough fluids, in particular water, okay?
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.100]   Meaning if you happen to overeat salt a bit,
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:34.460]   you will get thirsty, you will ingest more water,
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.420]   and you will excrete the excess sodium.
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.580]   There is evidence that the body can store sodium
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.540]   in various organs.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.700]   That storage of sodium may or may not be
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.260]   a detrimental thing.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.500]   In general, excess storage of sodium in tissues
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.820]   and organs of the brain and body is not thought
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.740]   to be good for long-term health,
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.980]   so eating much more sodium than you need
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.720]   for long periods of time is indeed bad for you.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:07.460]   Earlier, I mentioned that salt and your hunger
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:11.000]   and thirst for salt is homeostatically regulated,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.900]   and indeed that's the case,
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.980]   much like temperature is homeostatically regulated.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.520]   What that means is if you pay attention to it,
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.720]   if your salt levels are low, you will tend to crave salt
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.140]   and salty beverages and salty foods,
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:30.700]   and in most cases, you should probably follow that craving
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.040]   provided those salty beverages and salty foods
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.180]   are not bringing in a lot of other things
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.860]   or anything, ideally, that's bad for you.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.540]   So I think it's fair to say that whether or not
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.580]   you're vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore,
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:49.280]   that we should all try to limit our ingestion
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.360]   of processed foods.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.900]   My read of the literature is that, sure,
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.660]   some processed foods are acceptable for us
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.700]   and aren't going to kill us outright,
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.820]   but that for most people in the world,
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.900]   eating fewer processed foods is just going
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.760]   to be a good thing to do.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.740]   So following your salt hunger and thirst, in most cases,
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:14.400]   is going to be beneficial provided that it's in the context
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   of eating healthy non-processed foods
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.360]   on whatever backdrop of nutritional
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.180]   and dietary recommendations is right for you.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.580]   I simply can't tell you what to eat and what not to eat
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.620]   because I acknowledge the fact that some people are vegans
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.260]   because of ethical reasons related to animals,
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:37.340]   or some people are vegans because of reasons related
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.060]   to the climate and the environment.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.740]   Other people do it for specific health reasons.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.700]   Likewise, I know plenty of people that eat meat
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.360]   and avoid vegetables, believe it or not,
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.800]   and I know people that eat both,
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.980]   and they do this often each, I should say,
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.060]   all citing literature that supports their particular camp
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.360]   and their particular view.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.860]   It's not a territory I want to get into,
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.080]   but with respect to salt intake and the fact
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.760]   that salt intake is homeostatically regulated,
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.080]   it is the case that if you're craving salt,
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.780]   you probably need it.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.060]   So for those of you that are sweating excessively,
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.360]   or even if you're in a very hot environment
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.420]   and you're not exercising and you're just losing,
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.080]   you're losing water and salt from your system,
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.580]   remember also that you can be in a very cold environment,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.720]   very cold, dry environments often go together,
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.240]   and you can be losing a lot of fluids from your body
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.860]   and you will crave fluids and salt even though it's cold
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.800]   and you're not actually noticeably perspiring.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.440]   So if you're exercising a lot,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.800]   if you're in a particular cold, dry environment
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.460]   or a particular hot environment,
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.820]   you ought to be ingesting sufficient amounts
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.460]   of salt and fluid.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.960]   A rule of thumb for exercise-based replenishment of fluid
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.980]   comes from what I, some episodes back,
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.660]   referred to as the Galpin equation.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.400]   The Galpin equation, I named it after Andy Galpin,
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.100]   and I think that is the appropriate attribution there.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.540]   Andy Galpin is an exercise physiologist
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.500]   at Cal State Fullerton, I believe,
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.800]   and he's going to be a podcast guest
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.140]   here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.040]   He's an exceptional muscle physiologist.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.980]   He also lives in the practical realm
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.780]   where he gives recommendations about exercise
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.280]   to expert athletes, as well as the everyday person.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.420]   So the Galpin equation is based on the fact
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:31.060]   that we lose about one to five pounds of water per hour,
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.060]   which can definitely impact our mental capacity
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.920]   and our physical performance.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.580]   And the reason that loss of water from our system
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.780]   impacts mental capacity and physical performance
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.180]   has a lot to do with literally the changes
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.880]   in the volume of those cells, the size of those cells,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.420]   based on how much sodium is contained
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.820]   in or outside those cells,
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.620]   and something that I've alluded to before on the podcast,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.700]   and I'll talk about more in a moment,
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:59.080]   which is that neurons signal to one another
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.640]   by way of electricity
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.140]   through something called the action potential,
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.860]   and that actually requires sodium and potassium
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.020]   and magnesium.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.540]   So the Galpin equation suggests
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.700]   that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes,
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.260]   not just with water.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.720]   So that means water that has some sodium,
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.200]   potassium, and magnesium.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.420]   There are simple low cost ways to do that, we'll talk about.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.900]   And the formula for hydration,
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:27.960]   the so-called Galpin equation is your body weight in pounds
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.660]   divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.180]   you should drink every 15 minutes.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.300]   That may turn out to be more fluid
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.920]   than you can comfortably consume
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.860]   during the activity that you're performing.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:44.860]   Now, the Galpin equation is mainly designed for exercise,
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.060]   but I think is actually a very good rule of thumb
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.260]   for any time that you need to engage mental capacity,
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:53.840]   not just physical performance.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.660]   Your body weight in pounds divided by 30
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.920]   equals the ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.440]   does not necessarily mean you have to ingest it
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.220]   every 15 minutes on the dot.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.460]   And I think many activities, physical activities,
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.600]   but also cognitive activities like Zoom meetings
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   or in-person meetings or lecturing or running or cycling
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.340]   are going to make it complicated
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.660]   to ingest the appropriate amount of fluid
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.860]   every 15 minutes on the dot.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.740]   I'm not going to speak for Andy, for Dr. Galpin,
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.740]   but I think he would probably agree
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.940]   that these are averages to shoot for
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.660]   and that unless you're hyper neurotic,
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.000]   the idea is to make sure that you're entering the activity,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.100]   cognitive or physical, sufficiently hydrated,
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.660]   and that throughout that activity,
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.820]   you're hydrating regularly.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.880]   And it points to the fact that most people
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.140]   are probably under hydrating,
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.100]   but not just under hydrating from the perspective
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.020]   of not ingesting enough water,
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.460]   that they're probably not getting enough electrolytes
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.420]   as well, sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.780]   So I've said two somewhat contradictory things.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.980]   On the one hand, I said, follow your salt appetite,
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.020]   follow your salt thirst.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.860]   If you're craving salt,
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.260]   ingest some salt until you stop craving the salt.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.140]   On the other hand, I've given you this
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.500]   fairly specific recommendation
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.840]   based on the Galpin equation that you should ingest
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.900]   your body weight in pounds divided by 30.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.040]   That's how many ounces of fluid
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.660]   you should drink every 15 minutes,
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.020]   which I'm guessing for most people is going to be more fluid
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.380]   than they're currently drinking on average.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:37.020]   And so how could it be that you can have a recommendation
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.980]   for what's optimal that's different
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.060]   than the amount that you would reflexively drink?
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.420]   And it has to do with the fact
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.860]   that a lot of the hormone systems like vasopressin,
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.180]   antidiuretic hormone, other hormones like aldosterone,
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.520]   and a lot of the neural and hormonal signals
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.720]   that govern salt and water balance
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.020]   are fairly slow to kick in.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.500]   So for instance, if you eat a fairly salty meal
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.060]   and you sense that salt, you'll probably,
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.900]   meaning you detect it and perceive it,
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.460]   because the food tastes salty,
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.060]   you'll probably want to drink
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.520]   a fair amount of fluid with it.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.680]   Whereas if some of the salt is disguised by other flavors,
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.060]   something that we'll talk about in a few minutes
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.280]   when we talk about the neural representation
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.200]   of things like salty and sweet,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.640]   well, then you might not notice that something's salty,
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.220]   and then a few minutes or hours after ingesting that meal,
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.760]   you might feel very, very tired.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.960]   You might even wonder whether or not
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.520]   it's because of some blood sugar effect.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.000]   Maybe it's a crash in blood sugar, you might think,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.640]   or something else related to that meal,
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.460]   or maybe you think it's because of
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.820]   some other event in your life,
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.040]   but actually what has happened is you're dehydrated
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.180]   because you didn't recognize
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.060]   that you needed to drink more fluids.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:50.080]   So I want to acknowledge the contradiction
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.760]   in the idea that everything is homostatically regulated
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.780]   and therefore you are aware of what you need.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.480]   And the counterargument that,
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.440]   ah, you need to follow these strict recommendations,
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.560]   it's actually going to be somewhere in between.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560]   And of course, your body and brain can start to adapt
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.420]   to certain levels of salt intake.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.420]   There's a now fairly famous study that was done in Germany,
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.800]   which looked at different phases of salt intake,
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.860]   meaning they had subjects ingest
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.560]   either 12 grams of salt per day or nine grams per day
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.240]   or six grams per day for fairly long periods of time.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.360]   And they collected urine for testing.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.180]   This was actually a very controlled study.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.220]   I'm just going to paraphrase
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.240]   from the National Institutes of Health report on this study
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.960]   because they did a very nice writeup of it.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.380]   And they say that a big surprise of these results
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.420]   is that whatever the level of salt that was consumed,
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.620]   sodium was stored and released from the subjects bodies
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.400]   in fairly regular weekly and monthly patterns,
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.840]   meaning people tended to adapt
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.820]   to a certain level of salt intake.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.300]   And then it led to a fairly constant amount
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:03.360]   of salt retention and urine fluid excretion.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.640]   And that's because of the various hormones like aldosterone,
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.680]   which regulates sodium excretion from the kidney
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.400]   and glucocorticoids, which we'll talk about more in a moment
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.000]   which help regulate metabolism.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Glucocorticoids are released from the adrenal glands,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.800]   which ride the top of the kidneys.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.320]   And there's a very close relationship
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.080]   between the stress system, glucocorticoids
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.640]   and the salt system.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.360]   So the reason why your salt appetite
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.680]   isn't a perfect readout of how much salt you should ingest
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.760]   and why it might be helpful
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.220]   to follow some of these formulas like the Galpin equation,
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.960]   especially if you're engaging in exercise,
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.520]   where you're going to be perspiring, of course,
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.860]   is that your body will tend to adapt
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.640]   to a certain amount of salt intake over time.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.160]   And then your appetite for salt
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.520]   won't necessarily be the best indication
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.180]   of how much salt you should ingest or avoid.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.360]   Before I move on, I want to really reemphasize the fact
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.800]   that inside of the Galpin equation,
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.280]   there is that mention of every 15 minutes
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.580]   and people have come back to me again and again
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:03.420]   about this saying,
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.320]   "I can't drink that much water every 15 minutes.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.160]   It's too much volume of fluid in my stomach.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.400]   I can't run with that," et cetera.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.740]   Remember, these are averages.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.280]   So that's what you want to average
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.620]   around a particular activity.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.040]   These are not strict recommendations
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.780]   where a buzzer goes off and every 15 minutes,
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.440]   you have to chug that exact amount
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.280]   of electrolyte containing solution.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.520]   Another key feature of the study
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.000]   that I was referring to before,
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.360]   which incidentally was published
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   in the Journal of Clinical Investigation,
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.820]   is that the body regulates its salt and water balance
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.560]   not just by excreting sodium,
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.120]   but by retaining or releasing water.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.480]   And this is because of the relationship
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.200]   between sodium and water that we were talking about before.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.160]   And the advantage of this mechanism,
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.800]   they state here I'm paraphrasing,
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.240]   is that the long-term maintenance of body fluids
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.200]   is not as dependent on external water as once believed.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.520]   What the system probably evolved to do
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.420]   was to adjust to different levels of sodium availability
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.640]   in the environment.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.080]   And that raises a really key element of salt
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.280]   and its importance in human history
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.400]   and human evolution and human health.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.600]   We haven't talked too much about this,
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.280]   and there are several very good books
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.540]   about the history of salt.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:17.160]   You know, salt was a very valuable
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.640]   and heavily sought-after substance
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.600]   throughout much of human history,
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.840]   so much so that there are actually written reports
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.680]   of people being paid for labor in the form of salt.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.280]   And, you know, salt, when it's scarce,
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.940]   has been quite expensive in certain regions of the world,
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.420]   especially regions located further away from the sea.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.320]   And a friend of mine who has deep roots
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.280]   within the culinary community told me about
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.460]   traveling to some somewhat impoverished areas
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:52.440]   of Europe some years ago and going into homes
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.540]   where in the middle of the kitchen table,
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.840]   there was a fish, a salty fish,
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.960]   hanging from a thread above the table.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.400]   And that because of a lack of availability of table salt,
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.800]   the common practice was to take any food
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.040]   that needed some salt for additional flavoring
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.200]   and to actually rub that food on this salty fish
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.440]   or to squeeze the fish a bit onto the food substance
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.200]   in order to get salt from it.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.640]   So, you know, that's a very kind of extreme example.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.500]   Nowadays, we kind of take salt for granted
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.640]   and most of the discussion out there is about excess salt.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.920]   But as I'm pointing out that, you know,
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.440]   salt for a long time has been a very sought-after commodity
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.080]   and one that people really cherished for their health.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.640]   In the episode that I did on metabolism,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.320]   I talked about the relationship between salt and iodine.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.000]   If you're interested in iodine
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.400]   and whether or not iodized salt or non-iodized salt
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.500]   is best or required,
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.280]   I'd encourage you to listen to that episode,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.640]   which was about, again, metabolism.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.960]   Some people may need more iodine intake.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.340]   Some people perhaps do not.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.640]   Some people might even want to ingest things like kelp.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.920]   Some people might not.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.520]   So please listen to that episode
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.020]   if you're interested in the iodine aspects of salt,
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.840]   which have direct impact on thyroid hormone
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.840]   and thyroid function, which of course relates to metabolism.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.720]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.120]   and even a kind of proliferation of what I call fancy salts.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.280]   So whether or not you should be ingesting sea salts
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.600]   or whether or not common table salt will suffice.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.280]   In most cases, for what we're discussing here,
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.600]   common table salt is fine,
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.480]   but I should point out that sea salt
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.280]   often contains other minerals, which can be very useful,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.720]   and we will do entire episodes on those other minerals.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.840]   So sea salt can contain, you know,
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.640]   dozens or more of minerals,
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.680]   some of which can be quite valuable to our health,
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.960]   others of which are less important
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   and only need to be consumed in trace amounts,
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.760]   but you're not going to get many minerals, if any,
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.320]   from common table salt,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.240]   and that's why in addition to the pretty colors
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.000]   and perhaps some people report
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.060]   that they actually taste better,
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.920]   some of these so-called fancy salts or sea salts,
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.420]   you might want to consume a more advanced form of salt,
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.260]   if you will.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.240]   Although I suppose it's actually
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.580]   the more primitive form of salt
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.580]   if it's actually the one that comes from the ocean.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.500]   So we've all heard about how excess salt,
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.160]   it's bad for blood pressure,
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.400]   damage the heart, the brain, et cetera.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.620]   I do want to give some voice to situations
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.880]   where too little salt can actually cause problems,
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.520]   and this has everything to do with the nervous system.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.640]   So without getting into excessive amounts of detail,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.060]   the kidneys, as we talked about before,
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.760]   are going to regulate salt and fluid balance.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.360]   The adrenal glands, which ride atop the kidneys,
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.160]   are going to make glucocorticoids like aldosterone,
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.840]   and those are going to directly impact things like
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.700]   fluid balance, and in part, they do that by regulating
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:53.540]   how much craving for and tolerance of salty solutions
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.560]   we have, and there's some really nice studies
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.360]   that have looked at so-called adrenalectomies.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.800]   Now, this is an extreme case,
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.820]   and it's typically done in animal models,
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.840]   but it illustrates the role of the adrenals
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.040]   in salt preference.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.660]   Basically, when the glucocorticoid system,
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.080]   meaning the release of these particular hormones
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.320]   from the adrenal glands, is eliminated by adrenalectomy,
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.460]   ectomy means removal, then the threshold
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.800]   for what's considered too salty really shifts, okay?
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.200]   So typically, when the adrenals are intact,
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.180]   a animal or a human will prefer a mildly salty
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.880]   to moderately salty solution if given a choice,
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.620]   and then at some point, it's so salty
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.980]   that it just feels aversive.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.740]   Just like taking a gulp of seawater
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.160]   is almost always aversive.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.280]   I can't think of an instance where it's not aversive,
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.920]   and actually drinking seawater can kill you
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.000]   because of the high osmolarity of seawater.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.720]   You certainly don't want to drink seawater.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.440]   Under conditions where the adrenals are missing,
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.820]   animals and humans will tend to prefer
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:04.060]   a higher sodium concentration fluid,
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.640]   and they will be willing to tolerate ingesting
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.880]   very high concentrations of sodium.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.640]   Now, that's a very crude experiment
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.900]   and not one that you want to do, I promise you,
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.100]   but I mention it because it illustrates
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.760]   the very direct relationship between the stress system,
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.740]   which is the glucocorticoid system,
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.880]   and the salt craving system, and this actually makes sense.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.000]   Earlier, as we were talking about hypovolemic thirst,
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.200]   when there's a loss of blood pressure
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.400]   from usually due to a loss of blood from the body,
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.900]   there's a salt craving in order
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.420]   to bring that blood volume back up,
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.900]   because by ingesting salt,
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.000]   you bring fluid into the bloodstream,
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.480]   you're increasing that blood pressure,
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.800]   and you can restore the blood that's lost.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.900]   Now, there are many examples where if sodium levels
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.660]   get too low in the bloodstream,
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.020]   either because people are ingesting too little salt,
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.360]   or they are ingesting too much water
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.020]   and therefore excreting too much salt,
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.500]   that it can cause stress and anxiety.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.460]   There's some really nice data that point to the fact
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:09.220]   that low dietary sodium can actually exacerbate anxiety
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.140]   in animal models, and to some extent,
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.580]   there's evidence for this in humans as well,
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:16.780]   and that should not come as a surprise.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:20.200]   The whole basis for a relationship
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.660]   between the adrenal system, these glucocorticoids,
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.780]   things like aldosterone, and the craving for sodium,
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:30.340]   is that the stress system is a generic system designed
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:33.860]   to deal with various challenges to the organism,
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.320]   to you, or to me, or to an animal,
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.920]   and those challenges can arrive in many different forms.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.260]   It can be an infection, it can be famine,
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.500]   it can be lack of water, and so on,
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.900]   but in general, the stress response
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.020]   is one of elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure,
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.260]   and an ability to maintain movement
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.060]   and resistance to that challenge, okay?
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.140]   I've said this before, but I'll emphasize it again,
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:03.140]   there's this common misperception that stress makes us sick,
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.220]   and indeed, if stress lasts too long,
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:08.100]   it has a number of negative effects on our health,
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.340]   but more often than not, if we're pushing, pushing, pushing,
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:14.060]   we're studying or taking care of somebody
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.100]   or traveling like crazy,
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.620]   we don't tend to get sick under those conditions,
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:20.820]   but as soon as we stop,
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.960]   as soon as we reduce our adrenaline output,
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.700]   as soon as we reduce our glucocorticoid output
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.080]   from our adrenals, then we will get sick.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.620]   That's a very common occurrence,
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.300]   and it's because stress actually activates our immune system
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.920]   in the short term, so I'd like to try and dispel this myth
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.420]   that stress actually suppresses the immune system,
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.900]   at least not in the short term.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.100]   For long-term stress, it's a different issue.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.300]   You don't want long-term ongoing stress,
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.100]   especially if several weeks or more.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.640]   Nonetheless, it makes sense that bringing sodium
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.660]   into the body would be at least one way
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.860]   that we would be wired to counteract
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:01.060]   or to resist stressors, right?
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.240]   Stressors being the things on the outside coming at us,
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.820]   so it could be stressful relationships,
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.540]   stressful job situation, again, infection, and so on.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.860]   It's clear from a number of studies
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.800]   that if sodium levels are too low,
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.560]   that our ability to meet stress challenges is impaired.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.900]   Now, that doesn't mean to place your sodium intake cosmically
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.420]   high, but it does point to the fact
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.580]   that if you're feeling anxious,
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.280]   perhaps from low blood pressure,
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.020]   which can also give symptoms of anxiety,
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.300]   as we talked about before,
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.560]   but even if it's independent of low blood pressure,
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.540]   that slightly increasing sodium intake,
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.580]   again, I would encourage people to do this
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.780]   not in the context of processed foods and drinks,
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.840]   but ideally in the form of maybe a little bit
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.300]   of sea salt and water or salting one's food
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:51.980]   a little bit more, that that can stabilize blood pressure
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:55.420]   and one's ability to lean into stressors and challenges.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:58.380]   And I say this because I think that most people assume
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.980]   that adding salt is always bad,
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.560]   when in fact that's simply not the case.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.240]   There are conditions such as
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.860]   when we are under stress challenge,
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:10.080]   when there is a natural craving for more sodium,
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.260]   and that natural craving for more sodium
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.100]   is hardwired into us as a way to meet that challenge.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.420]   So it's hard for me to know whether or not
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.740]   people out there, especially the listeners of this podcast
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.820]   are getting too much, just enough or too little sodium.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.240]   So I can't know that, I'm shouting into a tunnel here.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.300]   You have to decide how much sodium you are ingesting.
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:34.080]   But I think that there's some, for most people,
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.740]   especially people who are not hypertensive, prehypertensive,
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.880]   there's some wiggle room to explore
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.840]   whether more intake of sodium could actually be beneficial
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.260]   for suppressing some of the anxiety responses
[01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:47.260]   that they might feel under conditions of stress.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.100]   Again, more studies need to be done.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.880]   Certainly more studies in humans need to be done,
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.620]   but the relationship between stress and sodium intake
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:58.620]   and the fact that additional sodium intake may be beneficial
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:03.140]   and indeed is naturally stimulated by stress
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.720]   shouldn't be necessarily looked at as a pathological event.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.020]   I know when some people get stressed,
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.300]   they crave salty foods.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:12.160]   That's actually a hardwired biological phenomenon
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.580]   that you see, not just in humans, but in animals,
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.980]   because this is a very primitive mechanism
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:18.900]   whereby your body is preparing
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:21.840]   to meet any additional challenges and stressors.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.700]   Now, we can't have a discussion about sodium
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.540]   without having a discussion about the other electrolytes,
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.020]   magnesium and potassium.
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:30.540]   Magnesium is important enough
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.160]   and an extensive enough topic
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.620]   that we should probably do an entire episode
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.860]   just on magnesium.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.900]   For purposes of today's discussion,
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.760]   I just will briefly touch on some of the forms of magnesium
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.780]   that we've discussed on the podcast before
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.640]   in different contexts.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.500]   I want to emphasize that many people
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.620]   are probably getting enough magnesium in their diet
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.560]   that they don't need to supplement magnesium.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.760]   Some people, however, opt to supplement magnesium
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.500]   in ways that can support them.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.580]   And there are many different forms of magnesium.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:03.520]   And just in very brief passing,
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.200]   I'll just say that there is some evidence
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.340]   that you can reduce muscle soreness from exercise
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:15.740]   by ingestion of magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:20.020]   I've talked before about magnesium threnate,
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.260]   T-H-R-E-N-O-A-T-E, magnesium threnate,
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.100]   for sake of promoting the transition into sleep
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.080]   and for depth of sleep.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.620]   And perhaps, again, highlighted perhaps,
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.980]   because right now it's mainly animal studies
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.740]   and ongoing human studies, but the data aren't all in,
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:38.740]   perhaps magnesium threnate can be used
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.900]   as a way to support cognitive function and longevity.
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.140]   That was discussed in the episode
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.160]   with Dr. Jack Feldman from UCLA.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.120]   Typically, magnesium threnate is taken 30 to 60 minutes
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.000]   before bedtime in order to encourage sleep.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.620]   You can go to our neural network newsletter
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:56.340]   and look for the one on sleep,
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.060]   and you can see the recommendations,
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.940]   or I should say the options for that,
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.140]   because again, you should always check with your physician.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:05.940]   Those aren't strict across the board recommendations.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.560]   And then there are other forms of magnesium,
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.000]   magnesium bisglycinate,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.620]   which is somewhat of an alternative to threonate,
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.540]   not known to have cognitive enhancing effects,
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:18.660]   but seems at least on par with magnesium threnate
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:21.460]   in terms of promoting transition into in-depth of sleep
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.780]   and so on.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:25.580]   There are other forms of magnesium, magnesium citrate,
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.500]   which has other functions.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.420]   Actually, magnesium citrate is a fairly effective laxative,
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.120]   not known to promote sleep and things of that sort.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.580]   So a lot of different forms of magnesium,
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.780]   and there's still other forms out there.
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:41.700]   Many people are not getting enough magnesium,
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:42.620]   many people are.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.060]   Okay, so that's magnesium.
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:47.520]   Anytime we're talking about sodium balance,
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.880]   we have to take into consideration potassium,
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.000]   because the way that the kidney works
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.820]   and the way that sodium balance is regulated
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:55.260]   both in the body and the brain
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.060]   is that sodium and potassium
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.860]   are working in close concert with one another.
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.380]   There are a lot of different recommendations
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:03.800]   about ratios out there,
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.420]   and they range widely from two to one ratio
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.780]   of potassium to sodium.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.860]   I've heard it in the other direction too.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.180]   I've heard a two to one sodium to potassium.
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.500]   The recommendations vary.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.460]   One of the sponsors of this podcast, for instance, Element,
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.960]   which I've talked about in this episode and before,
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.820]   the ratio there is a gram of sodium
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:27.500]   to 200 milligrams of potassium, 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:32.380]   So there they've opted for a five to one ratio
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.400]   of sodium to potassium.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.440]   And of course, many people opt
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.720]   to make their own hydration electrolyte formulas.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.280]   They'll put sea salt into some water,
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.400]   maybe even ingest a potassium tablet.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.120]   It all depends on the context.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.180]   An important contextual element is your diet.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.280]   So for instance, carbohydrates hold water in the body.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.620]   So regardless of how much salt
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.080]   and how much fluid you're ingesting,
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.420]   if you're ingesting carbohydrate and you drink fluids,
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:58.260]   water, some of that fluid is going to be retained
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.100]   in the body.
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:02.260]   Now, for people that are following low carbohydrate diets,
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.540]   one of the most immediate effects of a low carbohydrate diet
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.400]   is that you're going to excrete more water.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.080]   And so under those conditions,
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.260]   you're also going to lose not just water,
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.740]   but you'll probably also lose sodium and potassium.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.840]   And so some people, many people in fact,
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:20.280]   find that when they are in a lower or low carbohydrate diet,
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.320]   then they need to make sure
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.300]   that they're getting enough sodium and enough potassium.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.180]   And some people do that
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.420]   by taking 99 milligram potassium tablets
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.400]   every time they eat.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.620]   Some people do that by ingesting more foods
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.780]   that contain potassium.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.580]   And of course, some people who are on low carbohydrate diets
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:40.660]   do ingest vegetables or other forms of food
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.880]   that carry along with them potassium.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.220]   So it's quite variable from person to person.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.260]   I mean, you can imagine if carbohydrate holds water,
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.660]   water and salt balance and potassium go hand in hand
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.500]   and hand, that if you're on a low carbohydrate diet
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.980]   that you might need to adjust your salt intake and potassium.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:02.100]   And conversely, that if you're on a carbohydrate rich diet
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.380]   or a moderate carbohydrate diet,
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.320]   then you may need to ingest less sodium and less potassium.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.100]   And in fact, a certain amount of water
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.680]   is probably coming in through the foods you eat as well.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.660]   So I don't say all this to confuse you.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:17.540]   Again, I say this because it all depends on the context.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.900]   I'll give yet another context
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.420]   that I think is fairly common nowadays,
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:24.980]   which is many people are following a pattern of eating
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:27.940]   that more or less resembles intermittent fasting
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:29.420]   or at least time restricted feeding.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.420]   So they're eating between particular feeding windows.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:35.300]   And then in the certain parts of the 24 hour cycle,
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.300]   not just sleep,
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.060]   but during certain parts of their waking cycle,
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.440]   they're also actively avoiding food.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:44.060]   Banking on, I think either the possible,
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.240]   I want to say possible longevity promoting effects
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:50.960]   of intermittent fasting or, and or I should say,
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.620]   they are banking on the fact that for many people
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.100]   not eating is easier than portion control
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.100]   for certain parts of the day.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:01.040]   And so they find it beneficial to limit calories overall
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.880]   to a given amount, depending on what their goals are,
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.840]   by not consuming food for certain periods of the day.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.340]   But usually during those periods of the day,
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.620]   they're consuming fluids.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.740]   And oftentimes those fluids include not just water,
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.360]   but caffeine and caffeine is a diuretic.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.580]   It actually causes the excretion of fluids from the body
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:22.040]   in part because it causes the excretion of sodium.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.440]   All of that to say that if you're somebody who,
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.940]   for instance, eats your first meal around noon
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:29.840]   or one or 2 p.m. and you're fasting
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.140]   for the early part of the day and you're drinking coffee
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:35.400]   or tea or ingesting a lot of water,
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.060]   you are going to be excreting sodium along with that water.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.420]   And so many people, including myself, find that it's useful,
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.100]   especially when I'm drinking caffeine
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:49.080]   during that so-called fasting or non-food intake part
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.240]   of time restricted feeding,
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.420]   that I'm making sure to get enough salt
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:56.200]   either in the form of something like Element,
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.160]   an electrolyte drink,
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.360]   or putting some sea salt into some water,
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.680]   or certainly anytime one is ingesting caffeine,
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.580]   replacing some of the lost water
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.700]   by increasing one's water intake.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:10.520]   There are some simple rules of thumb around this
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.300]   that I think can get most people into a place
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.900]   where they're more comfortable and functioning better,
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.300]   which is for every ounce of coffee or tea that you drink,
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.720]   I should say caffeinated coffee or tea that you drink,
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.240]   that you consume one and a half times as much water.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.960]   So let's say you have an eight ounce coffee,
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.760]   try and drink about, you don't have to be exact,
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.560]   but try and drink about a 12 ounce glass of water.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.760]   And you might want to put a tiny bit of sodium into that.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.960]   By tiny bit, I just mean a tiny pinch of sodium.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.360]   Because remember, even if we're talking about
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:43.720]   increasing the amount of sodium intake overall,
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.000]   the total amount of sodium contained in salt
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.140]   is sufficiently high that even just a quarter teaspoon
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.900]   is going to really start to move that number up
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:54.620]   towards that range that's still within the safe range.
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:57.100]   But you're going to, if you keep doing that all day long,
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:58.460]   you're very quickly going to get into that
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:01.860]   excessive salt intake range that is deleterious for health.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:03.500]   So again, if you're consuming more caffeine,
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:06.280]   you're going to be excreting water and salt and potassium.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.580]   And so you're going to have to find ways
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.620]   to bring water, salt, and potassium back in.
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:11.520]   Again, this has to be evaluated
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.100]   for each of your own individual situations.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.060]   If you're exercising fasted,
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:19.700]   and you're doing that after drinking caffeine,
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.480]   then before, during, and certainly after exercise,
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.220]   you're going to want to replenish the fluids
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.300]   and electrolytes that you lost, including sodium.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.300]   So you can imagine how this all starts
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.880]   to become pretty dizzying,
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.420]   and yet it doesn't have to be dizzying.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.080]   We can provide some useful ranges
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.260]   that for most people will work.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.020]   And so let's talk about what those ranges are.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.660]   And I'm going to point you to a resource
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:42.380]   that explores what those ranges are
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.820]   in these various contexts of nutrition, exercise, and so on.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:50.180]   The resource is a book that was authored by Dr. James D.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.620]   Nicolantonio.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.060]   He's not a medical doctor.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:58.060]   He's a scientist that studies cardiovascular physiology,
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.660]   as well, I believe, as a doctor of pharmacy.
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:02.740]   And the title of the book is "The Salt Fix."
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.220]   "The Salt Fix" is an interesting read
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:06.340]   because it points to, first of all,
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:11.340]   the history of salt in society and as it relates to health.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.740]   It actually emphasizes some of the major missteps,
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.980]   maybe even pretty drastic errors that have been made
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:20.320]   in terms of trying to interpret the role
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.260]   that salt has in various diseases
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.940]   and emphasizes some of the ways
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:29.480]   in which perhaps increasing salt
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.700]   can actually improve health outcomes.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.820]   And I think it strikes a pretty nice balance
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   between what's commonly known about salt
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:40.340]   and what I believe ought to be known about salt,
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.240]   or at least taken into consideration.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.540]   The book does provide certain recommendations,
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.620]   and I actually reached out to the author.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.300]   I've never met him in person or talked to him directly.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.980]   And I asked him outright, I said,
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:59.240]   "How much salt do you recommend people take on average?"
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.980]   And he gave, of course, the appropriate caveats
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.440]   about pre-hypertension, hypertension, et cetera,
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.940]   but made a recommendation which I'll just share with you.
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.300]   And if you want to learn more
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.580]   about the support for this recommendation,
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:14.860]   you can check out his book.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:17.120]   The recommendation he made was anywhere
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.520]   from eight to 12 grams of salt a day,
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   which corresponds to 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.960]   So going back to the current recommendations
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:32.220]   that we talked about before, 2.3 grams of sodium per day,
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:37.220]   this is about 1 1/2 times to double the amount of sodium
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.900]   that's currently recommended in most circles.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.300]   And then what this corresponds to
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:46.260]   is about 1 1/2 to two teaspoons of salt per day
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.080]   to arrive at that 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:52.900]   Again, this is the recommendation that was passed along
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.940]   for most people, most conditions,
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.740]   barring specific health issues.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.260]   Now, what was also interesting is he pointed
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.300]   to a sodium to potassium ratio,
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.380]   which is four grams of potassium.
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.900]   And he also mentioned 400 milligrams of magnesium
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.140]   and pointed out, and I generally agree here
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.040]   that many people are deficient in magnesium.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:18.880]   So again, that was a 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium,
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.020]   four grams of potassium.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:21.980]   You might think, well, gosh,
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.840]   that's a 1 1/2 to two times the current recommendation,
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.620]   but we can go back to that study
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.380]   that was mentioned earlier in the episode,
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.780]   that 2011 study where I described this sort
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.940]   of J-shaped curve in which when you look
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.340]   at the occurrence of these negative health events,
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.460]   they were fairly low at low sodium intake,
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:45.500]   lower still at slightly higher sodium intake,
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.540]   much in line with the recommendations that are made
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.980]   or that Dr. D. Nicolantonio passed along to me.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.660]   And then they increased quite,
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.480]   those health risks increased quite substantially
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.860]   as one moves out past six grams of sodium,
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.100]   seven grams of sodium per day.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:04.780]   That's when things really do seem to get hazardous.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.580]   And really it makes sense, I think,
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.200]   given the consensus around this
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.300]   to really avoid very high salt intake.
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:17.180]   So the salt fix describes the rationale
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.180]   behind those recommendations.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:23.380]   The salt fix also describes in quite beautiful detail
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:27.500]   the relationship between salt intake, potassium intake,
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:31.020]   and the relationship to the sugar consumption system.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.220]   I'd like to pick up on this idea of the relationship
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.940]   between salt and sugar,
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.620]   because I think that one key aspect
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.340]   of the way that salt can work and can benefit us
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.860]   or can harm us has to do with the way that sodium
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:49.100]   and sugar are regulated and actually perceived by the brain
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.600]   and how under conditions of certain levels of sodium intake,
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.660]   we might be inspired to seek more sugar
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.820]   or to crave sweets more or less.
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.620]   So up until now, we've been talking about salt
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:01.900]   as a substance and a way to regulate fluid balance
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:04.220]   and blood volume and so on.
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:06.300]   We haven't talked a lot about salt as a taste
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.920]   or the taste of things that are salty.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:12.280]   And yet we know that we have salt receptors,
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.320]   meaning neurons that fire action potentials
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.780]   when salty substances are detected,
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:20.920]   much in the same way that we have sweet detectors
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:24.680]   and bitter detectors, and we have detectors of umami,
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:27.140]   the savory flavor on our tongue.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.120]   And earlier at the beginning of the episode,
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.020]   I talked about the fact that we have sweet receptors,
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.440]   neurons that respond to the presence of sugar
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.820]   or even non-caloric sweet things in the gut,
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:42.120]   and that signals up to the brain through the vagus nerve,
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.020]   and those signals converge on pathways
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.920]   that relate to dopamine and so on.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.920]   Well, we also have salt sensors at various locations
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.020]   throughout our digestive tract,
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:53.600]   although the sensation and the taste of salt
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.640]   actually exerts a very robust effect
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:59.000]   on certain areas of the brain
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.200]   that can either make us crave more or sate,
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.040]   meaning fulfill our desire for salt.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.900]   And you can imagine why this would be important.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.240]   Your brain actually has to register
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.680]   whether or not you're bringing in salt
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.360]   in order to know whether or not
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.520]   you are going to crave salt more or not.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:19.560]   And beautiful work that's been done by the Zucker Lab,
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.400]   Z-U-K-E-R, Zucker Lab at Columbia University,
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.880]   as well as many other labs,
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.200]   have used imaging techniques and other techniques
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.400]   such as molecular biology
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.400]   to define these so-called parallel pathways.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.960]   Parallel meaning pathways that represent sweet
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.960]   or the presence of sweet taste in the mouth and gut.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.800]   Parallel pathways, meaning neural circuits
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.980]   that represent the presence of salty tastes
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.880]   in the mouth and gut and so on.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.440]   And that those go into the brain,
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.680]   move up through brain stem centers
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.200]   and up to the neocortex,
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.600]   indeed where our seat of our conscious perception is,
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.400]   to give us a sense and a perception
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.600]   of the components of the foods
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.960]   that we happen to be ingesting
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.740]   and a sense and a perception of the fluids
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:02.060]   and the components of those fluids
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.040]   that we happen to be ingesting.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.900]   Now, parallel pathways, as I'm describing them,
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.700]   are a fundamental feature of every sensory system,
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:13.360]   not just the taste system, but also the visual system.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.760]   We have parallel pathways for perceiving dark objects
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   versus light objects,
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.840]   for perceiving red versus green, et cetera.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.580]   This is a fundamental feature of how we are built
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:24.260]   and how our nervous system works.
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:28.680]   And in the taste system, much like in these other systems,
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.320]   these pathways are indeed parallel,
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:34.480]   but they converge and they can influence one another.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.520]   And I think the simplest way to put this
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.520]   is in the context first of the visual system,
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.280]   whereby your ability to detect the color red
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.840]   has everything to do with the fact
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.760]   that you have neurons in your eye
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.360]   that absorb long wavelengths of light that we call reds,
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.560]   red wavelengths of light,
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.920]   which are longer wavelengths than say blue light,
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.200]   just shorter wavelength.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.160]   But it is really the comparison of the electrical activity
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.320]   of the neurons that absorb red light
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.460]   with the activity of the neurons that absorb green light,
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:05.720]   which actually gives you the perception of red.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.940]   So that might seem a little counterintuitive,
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.260]   but indeed it's not.
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:12.700]   It's actually because something is red
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:15.680]   and has less greenness that we perceive it
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.320]   as more red than the green.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.600]   And this is actually the way
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.640]   that your entire nervous system works,
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.280]   is that we aren't really good at evaluating absolute levels
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.040]   of anything in the context of perception.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.440]   It's only by comparison.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.480]   And actually there's a fun experiment that you can do.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.680]   I think you could probably find it easily online.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.080]   You could also do this experiment at home.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.040]   You can stare at something that's red
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.140]   or green for that matter for a while.
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:44.240]   So you make an active decision to not blink
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.960]   and to stare at something that's red.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.900]   And then you look away from that thing
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.400]   and you'll actually see a green after image
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.800]   of that red object.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.240]   Conversely, if you look at something that's green for a while
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.400]   and you stare at it and you look away,
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.700]   you will see the red after image of that thing.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:01.540]   Now the taste system doesn't have quite the same
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:05.500]   after taste type effect, but nonetheless,
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:08.720]   the pathways, the parallel pathways for salty
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:12.240]   and the parallel pathways for sweet and bitter and so on
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.480]   can actually interact.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.840]   And this has important relevance
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.500]   in the context of food choices and sugar craving.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:21.300]   One of the things that's commonplace nowadays
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:25.360]   is in many processed foods, there is a business, literally,
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.260]   a business of putting so-called hidden sugars.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:29.740]   And these hidden sugars are not always
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.100]   in the form of caloric sugars.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.660]   They're sometimes in the form of artificial sweeteners
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.220]   into various foods.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:38.300]   And you might say, well, why would they put more sugar
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:41.140]   into a food and then disguise the sugary taste
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.420]   given that sweet tastes often compel people
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.940]   to eat more of these things?
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.740]   Well, it's a way actually of bypassing
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.980]   some of the homeostatic mechanisms for sweet.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:53.340]   Even though we might think that the more sweet stuff we eat,
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.140]   the more sweet stuff we crave,
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.340]   in general, people have a threshold whereby they say,
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:59.940]   okay, I've had enough sugary stuff.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:01.620]   You can actually experience this
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.340]   if you ever feel like something is really, really sweet.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:06.420]   Take a little sip of water
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.180]   with a little bit of lemon juice in it or vinegar,
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.940]   and it will quickly quench that overly sweet sensation
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.780]   or perception.
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:14.720]   It will disappear almost immediately.
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.220]   There's actually a practice in fancy meals
[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.140]   of cleansing the palate
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:20.960]   through the ingestion of different foods.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.660]   And that's the same idea that you're cleansing the palate.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:24.940]   You're actually neutralizing the previous taste
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.940]   so then they can bring yet another dish
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:30.140]   to overindulge you in decadence and so forth.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:32.680]   So these sensory systems interact in this way.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.940]   By putting sugars into foods
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:40.100]   and hiding the sugary taste of those foods,
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.620]   those foods, even if they contain artificial sweeteners,
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.500]   can activate the sorts of neurons
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.140]   that we talked about at the beginning of the episode,
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:50.300]   like the neuropod cells that will then signal to the brain
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:51.340]   to release more dopamine
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:52.940]   and make you crave more of that food.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:55.420]   Whereas had you been able to perceive
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:57.720]   the true sweetness of that food,
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.100]   you might've consumed less,
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.380]   and indeed that's what happens.
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:03.300]   So these hidden sugars are kind of diabolical.
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.020]   Why am I talking about all of this
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.820]   in the context of an episode on salt?
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:10.500]   Well, as many of you have probably noticed,
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:15.420]   a lot of foods out there contain a salty-sweet combination,
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.300]   and it's that combination of salty and sweet,
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:20.340]   which can actually lead you to consume more
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:24.780]   of the salty-sweet food than you would have
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:28.260]   if it had just been sweet or it had just been salty.
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:32.540]   And that's because both sweet taste and salty taste
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.400]   have a homeostatic balance.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.540]   So if you ingest something that's very, very salty,
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:39.360]   pretty soon your appetite for salty foods will be reduced.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.800]   But if you mask some of that with sweet,
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.460]   well, because of the interactions
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:45.920]   of these parallel pathways,
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.260]   you somewhat shut down your perception
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.640]   of how much salt you're ingesting.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:53.900]   Or conversely, by ingesting some salt with sweet foods,
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.500]   you mask some of the sweetness of the sweet foods
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:57.340]   that you're tasting,
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:58.940]   and you will continue to indulge in those foods.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:03.060]   So salty-sweet interactions can be very diabolical.
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.420]   They can also be very tasty,
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:06.900]   but they can be very diabolical in terms of inspiring you
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:10.180]   to eat more of a particular food than you would otherwise
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:13.340]   if you were just following your homeostatic salt
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:16.680]   or your homeostatic sugar balance systems.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.780]   And the beautiful imaging work that's been done
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:20.420]   by the Zucker Lab and other labs
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.820]   has actually been able to reveal
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:24.500]   how some of this might work by showing, for instance,
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:26.720]   that a certain ensemble,
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.300]   meaning a certain group of neurons,
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.580]   is activated by a sweet taste
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:34.240]   and a non-overlapping distinct set of neurons just nearby,
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.100]   sitting cheek to jowl with those other neurons,
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.300]   would be activated by salty tastes
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.180]   and yet others by bitter taste, et cetera.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.380]   So there's a separate map of these different
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:44.560]   parallel pathways,
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.780]   but that when foods or fluids are ingested
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:50.020]   that are both salty and sweet,
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.740]   you get a yet entirely different
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.740]   ensemble of neurons activated.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:58.540]   So your brain, whether or not it's for your visual system
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:00.580]   or your auditory system or your taste system,
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:03.420]   has a way of representing the pure form of taste,
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.040]   salty, sweet, bitter, et cetera,
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.780]   and has a way of representing their combinations.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:12.060]   And food manufacturers have exploited this to large degree.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:14.140]   I mention all of this because if you're somebody
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.600]   who's looking to explore either increasing
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.020]   or decreasing your sodium intake for health benefits,
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:22.940]   for performance benefits,
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:25.620]   in many ways, it is useful to do that
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.140]   in the context of a fairly pure,
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.940]   meaning unprocessed food intake background,
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:33.860]   whether or not that's keto, carnivore, omnivore,
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:36.420]   intermittent fasting, or what have you,
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:37.540]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:42.020]   But the closer that foods are to their basic form and taste,
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:46.300]   meaning not combinations of large amounts of ingredients
[01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:49.100]   and certainly avoiding highly processed foods,
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:51.700]   the more quickly you're going to be able to hone in
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:54.860]   on your specific salt appetite and salt needs,
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:56.940]   which as I've pointed out numerous times
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.220]   throughout this episode are going to vary
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:00.320]   from person to person, depending on nutrition,
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.900]   depending on activity, depending on hormone status,
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:06.020]   or even portion of your menstrual cycle for that matter.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:07.900]   So if you want to hone in
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.800]   on the appropriate amount of sodium for you,
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.740]   yes, blood pressure is going to be an important metric
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.320]   to pay attention to as you go along.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.720]   And the parameters for healthy blood pressure ranges
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.220]   are readily available online.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:19.940]   So I'll let you refer to those
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.860]   in order to determine those for yourself.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.620]   But in determining whether or not
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:27.640]   increasing your salt intake might be beneficial for,
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.500]   for instance, for reducing anxiety a bit
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.160]   or for increasing blood pressure
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.560]   to offset some of these postural syndromes
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.900]   where you get dizzy, et cetera,
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:37.800]   for improving sports performance or cognitive performance,
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.460]   I can only recommend that you do this
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:43.580]   in a fairly clean context
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:44.700]   where you're not trying to do this
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.580]   by ingesting a bunch of salty foods
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.540]   or salty sweet foods, et cetera.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:51.380]   And indeed many people find, and it's reviewed a bit,
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:53.600]   and some of the data are reviewed in the book,
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:57.820]   The Salt Fix, that when people increase their salt intake
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:01.580]   in a backdrop of relatively unprocessed foods,
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:04.420]   that sugar cravings can indeed be vastly reduced.
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:06.160]   And that makes sense given the way
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:09.000]   that these neural pathways for salty and sweet interact.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.900]   Now, thus far, I've already covered quite a lot of material,
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:15.380]   but I would be completely remiss
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:17.980]   if I didn't emphasize the crucial role
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:21.660]   that sodium plays in the way that neurons function.
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:24.580]   In fact, sodium is one of the key elements
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:27.300]   that allows neurons to function at all.
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.620]   And that's by way of engaging
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.620]   what we call the action potential.
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:35.600]   The action potential is the firing of electrical activity
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.320]   by neurons.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.740]   Neurons can engage electrical activity
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:40.880]   in a number of different ways.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.180]   They have graded potentials, they have gap junctions.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:45.740]   There's a whole landscape
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:48.980]   of different electrophysiologies of neurons
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:51.600]   that I don't want to go into just yet,
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.300]   at least not in this episode.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.940]   But the action potential is the fundamental way
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:58.620]   in which neurons communicate with one another.
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.700]   They're sometimes called spikes.
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:04.260]   It's just kind of nomenclature that neuroscientists use.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.420]   I'm just going to briefly describe the action potential
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.340]   and the role that sodium plays.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.800]   And this will involve a little bit of chemistry,
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.120]   but I promise it will be accessible to anyone,
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.360]   even if you don't have a chemistry or a physics background
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.960]   or electrophysiology background.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.820]   Neurons have an inside and an outside,
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:25.620]   and inside are things like your genetic material.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.800]   They have a bunch of things floating around in there
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:29.740]   that allow those cells to function,
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:32.780]   and they tend to have this wire extending out of them,
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:33.920]   sometimes a very long wire,
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.100]   sometimes a short one that we call the axon.
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:39.200]   And at the end of that wire, that axon,
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.460]   they release little packets of chemicals
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:47.120]   that either cause the next neuron to fire action potentials
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.900]   or prevent the next neuron from firing action potential.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:53.860]   So they kind of vomit out these little packets of chemicals
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:57.760]   that either inspire or suppress action potentials
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.780]   in other neurons.
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:03.780]   The way that that whole process occurs
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:07.480]   is that a given neuron needs to change
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.540]   its electrical activity.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:11.980]   So normally neurons are hanging out
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:13.860]   and they have what we call a negative charge.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.300]   And the reason they have a negative charge
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:18.220]   is that the inside of the cell
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.620]   has things floating around in it,
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.420]   like potassium, a little bit of sodium,
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:23.900]   and some stuff like chloride.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.060]   These are literally just,
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.460]   just imagine these as little balls of stuff.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.520]   And if they have a negative charge on them,
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:32.600]   then the inside of the cell
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.040]   is going to tend to be more negative.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.120]   And outside of the cell, it turns out,
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:38.600]   you're going to have a bunch of stuff
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.680]   that's positively charged.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.700]   And one of the main factors
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.940]   in creating that positive charge is sodium.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.080]   Sodium carries a positive charge.
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.440]   So you have neurons that you can just imagine,
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.160]   for sake of this discussion,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.620]   you can just imagine as a sphere
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.660]   with a little wire sticking out of it,
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:58.700]   they, you can put a little minus on the inside for negative.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.260]   You can put a little plus on the outside for positive.
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:05.980]   And when that neuron is stimulated by another neuron,
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:07.100]   if the stimulation,
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.900]   the electrical stimulation is sufficiently high,
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:14.620]   meaning enough little packets of neurotransmitter
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.220]   have been vomited onto its surface
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.220]   at sufficient concentration,
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:24.000]   what happens is little pores, little spaces,
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.700]   little gaps open up in the membrane of that cell
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:31.800]   that separates the inside from the outside.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.100]   And because it's positive,
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.900]   there's a lot of positive charge outside,
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:38.320]   and there's a lot of negative inside,
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.460]   it's like a boulder running downhill.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:42.540]   All this stuff tends to rush downhill.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:44.700]   It tries to create even amounts of charge.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:47.180]   So it's negative on the inside, positive on the outside.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:51.420]   And what happens is sodium rushes into the cell,
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:53.540]   carrying a lot of charge into the cell.
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.040]   And as a consequence,
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.540]   the charge of that cell goes from negative,
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:00.280]   actually very negative, to quite positive.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:03.820]   And if it hits a certain threshold of positive charge
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.380]   because of all the sodium ions going into the cell,
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:10.300]   then it fires what's called an action potential.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:13.540]   And it vomits out its own set of chemicals
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:14.420]   onto the next neuron.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:16.360]   And so it sets off a chain of,
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.960]   one neuron goes from negative to positive,
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.600]   vomits out chemicals onto the next one.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:24.420]   The next one, the next neuron that binds to receptors
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:26.200]   or enters the cell,
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.020]   and that cell goes from negative to positive charge,
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.140]   vomits its contents onto the next cell,
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:33.480]   and so on and so forth.
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:37.840]   Sodium rushing into the cell, therefore,
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:41.240]   is the way that the action potential is stimulated.
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:44.280]   In other words, sodium is the way
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.740]   that neurons communicate with one another.
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:50.020]   Now, the neurons don't stay in a positive charge,
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:52.500]   otherwise they would just keep vomiting out their contents.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:53.680]   [imitates vomiting]
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.060]   But they need to maintain some of that,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:56.940]   and they need to go back to preparing to do it
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:59.340]   the next time and the next time by resting a bit.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:02.020]   And it turns out that the way they restore their charge
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:06.580]   is by pushing that sodium back out of the cell.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:08.280]   There are mechanisms in place to do that,
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:11.220]   things like the so-called sodium-potassium pump.
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:14.520]   There's a change in the levels of potassium
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.600]   across the cell membrane and so on and so forth.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.000]   If you want to look at a demonstration of this,
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.840]   you can put into a web browser the action potential.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.560]   You'll find some beautiful descriptions there
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.560]   on YouTube and elsewhere.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:28.320]   Maybe some time on Instagram,
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.280]   I'll do a description with a diagram,
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:31.660]   'cause I realize a number of people
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:33.000]   are just listening to this.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.480]   I can't do that here, I won't do that here,
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.520]   'cause I want everyone to be able
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.840]   to get the same amount of material
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:39.200]   regardless of whether or not they're watching
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:40.860]   and/or listening to this.
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:43.680]   But the point I'd like to make,
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.760]   at least as it relates to this episode on salt,
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:49.840]   is that having sufficient levels of salt in your system
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.260]   allows your brain to function,
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.360]   allows your nervous system to function at all.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.400]   Again, this is the most basic aspect
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.080]   of nervous system function.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:02.080]   And there are cases where this whole system gets disrupted.
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:06.040]   And that brings us to the topic of sodium and water balance.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.440]   As many of you have probably heard,
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.700]   but hopefully if you haven't,
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.060]   you'll take this message seriously.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:15.780]   If you drink too much water,
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.740]   especially in a short amount of time,
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.360]   you can actually kill yourself, right?
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.700]   And we certainly don't want that to happen.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:25.740]   If you ingest a lot of water
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.320]   in a very short period of time,
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.060]   something called the hypernatremia,
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:32.740]   you will excrete a lot of sodium very quickly,
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:35.040]   and your ability to regulate kidney function
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.140]   will be disrupted.
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:37.620]   But in addition to that,
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.600]   your brain can actually stop functioning.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:43.520]   So people have actually consumed water to excess,
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:45.820]   especially after sports events and so forth.
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:49.220]   And if that water doesn't contain sufficient electrolytes,
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.380]   you can actually shut down neurons' ability
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:54.020]   to function at all by disrupting
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:56.460]   this balance of sodium and potassium
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:58.380]   and the amount of extracellular sodium
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.820]   and neurons' ability to signal to one another
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.300]   through action potentials.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:04.800]   And I can't emphasize the importance
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.060]   of action potentials enough.
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:07.780]   They are the way that I can lift my pen.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:09.180]   Right now, they're the way that I can speak.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:10.740]   They're the way that you breathe.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:12.620]   They literally control all aspects
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.380]   of your nervous system function.
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.100]   Now, it takes quite a lot of water intake
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.020]   before you excrete enough sodium
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:20.060]   that your nervous system is going to shut down.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.640]   And I certainly don't want to give the impression
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.260]   that simply by ingesting more sodium,
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:24.900]   your neurons will work better.
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:26.300]   But it absolutely is the case
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:28.780]   that if you don't ingest enough sodium,
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:31.500]   that your neurons won't function as well as they could,
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:34.440]   and that if your sodium levels are made too low
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:40.580]   by hemorrhage or by ingesting so much water, fluid,
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:44.300]   that you excrete excess amounts of sodium
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:46.860]   or through any other mechanism, that is,
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:48.800]   then indeed your neurons won't be able
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.860]   to fire action potentials,
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:52.300]   and your brain and nervous system simply won't work.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.720]   And that's one of the primary reasons
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.020]   why dehydration leads to confusion and dizziness
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.820]   and lack of coordination.
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:00.460]   And I've talked about this a bit
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.940]   in the episode on endurance,
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.760]   but there are instances in which competitive athletes
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.020]   have come into the stadium to finish a final lap
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.840]   of a long endurance race and are completely disoriented
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.860]   and actually can't find their way to the finish line.
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.460]   It might sound like kind of a silly, kind of crazy example,
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:20.440]   but there are examples of people having severe mental issues
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.940]   and physical issues post-exercise
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.180]   when that exercise involved a ton of sweating
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:28.220]   or hot environments or insufficient ingestion of fluids
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.380]   and electrolytes,
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:31.900]   because included in the electrolyte formula, of course,
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:32.740]   is sodium.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:33.700]   And as you just learned,
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:36.940]   sodium is absolutely crucial for neurons to function.
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:40.740]   So to briefly recap some of what I've talked about today,
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:43.780]   we talked about how the brain monitors the amount of salt
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:47.180]   in your brain and body and how that relates to thirst
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:51.740]   and the drive to consume more fluid and/or salty fluids.
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:53.880]   We also talked a little bit about the hormones
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.080]   that come from the brain and operate
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.940]   at the level of the kidney in order to either retain
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:02.700]   or allow water to leave your system.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.040]   We talked a little bit about the function
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.860]   of the kidney itself, a beautiful organ.
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:11.080]   We talked about the relationship between salt intake
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.900]   and various health parameters
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:17.900]   and how a particular range of salt intake might be optimal
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.820]   depending on the context
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.360]   in which that range is being consumed,
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:25.500]   meaning depending on whether or not you're hypertensive,
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.880]   pre-hypertensive, or normal tension.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.300]   We talked about fluid intake and electrolyte intake,
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.000]   so sodium, potassium, and magnesium
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.280]   in the context of athletic or sports performance,
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.560]   but also in terms of maintaining cognitive function.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.160]   Talked about the Galpin equation,
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:41.940]   which you could easily adapt to your body weight
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.900]   and to your circumstances.
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:46.840]   Of course, adjusting the amount of fluid
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:51.040]   and electrolyte intake upwards if you're exercising
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.020]   or working in very hot environments,
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:56.100]   downwards maybe if you're in less hot environments
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:57.840]   where you're sweating less and so on.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.260]   We also talked about the relationship
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:02.860]   between the stress system and the salt craving system
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:05.380]   and why those two systems interact
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:10.300]   and why for some people who may suffer a bit from anxiety
[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:12.260]   or under conditions of stress,
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:14.340]   increasing salt intake provided it's done
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:18.020]   through healthy means might actually be beneficial.
[01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:19.260]   We also talked about conditions
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:22.380]   in which increasing salt intake might be beneficial
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:24.940]   for offsetting low blood pressure
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:26.620]   and some of these postural syndromes
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.080]   that can lead people to dizziness and so forth.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.580]   These are things that have to be explored
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:34.000]   on an individual basis and of course have to be explored
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.900]   with the support of your doctor.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.440]   I mentioned the salt fix,
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.280]   which I think is an interesting read.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.420]   Keeping in mind that a lot of the information in there
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:43.600]   runs counter to the typical narrative
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:45.040]   that you hear around salt,
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.260]   but nonetheless has some very interesting points
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.880]   that you might want to consider
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:52.560]   and certainly will broaden your view of the history of
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.200]   and the applications of salt
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.000]   as it relates to a great number of health
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.400]   and performance metrics.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.760]   We also talked about the perception of salt,
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.780]   meaning the perception of salty tastes
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:04.360]   and how the perception of salty tastes
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:06.580]   and the perception of other tastes like sweet
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:08.220]   can interact with one another
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:11.140]   to drive things like increased sugar intake
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:12.720]   when you're not even aware of it.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.500]   And indeed how the combination of salty and sweet tastes
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.760]   can bias you towards craving more, for instance,
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:22.780]   processed foods and why that might be a good thing to avoid.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.640]   And of course we talked about salt
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:27.220]   and its critical role in the action potential,
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:29.140]   the fundamental way in which the nervous system
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.460]   functions at all.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:33.040]   So my hope for you in listening to this episode
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.280]   is that you consider a question
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:39.520]   and that question is what salt intake is best for you
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.060]   and that you place that question
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:44.120]   in the context of your fluid intake,
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.160]   you place that in the context of the diet you're following,
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:50.360]   the amount of caffeine you might be ingesting
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:52.520]   and the diuretic effects of caffeine
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.780]   and crucially that you place that
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:58.120]   in the context of the electrolytes more generally,
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.320]   meaning sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.220]   Someday there will be an online program or an app I imagine
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:08.880]   where one could put a bunch of different parameters in
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:12.560]   about their particular health status,
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.440]   their particular diet, their particular exercise, et cetera.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:18.300]   Maybe it would all be run by AI algorithm or something
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.040]   where it would monitor all of that for us.
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:23.940]   And then it would spit out for us a precise amount of sodium
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:25.760]   that we should take in each day.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:29.360]   Unfortunately, no such tool or device exists right now.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.000]   And so all of us have to figure out
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.920]   the appropriate amount of sodium intake for ourselves.
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.360]   And that has to be done
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:39.240]   under these contextual considerations.
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:41.540]   Who knows, maybe one of you will design such an app
[01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:42.640]   or such a device.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.240]   I think it would be very useful.
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.900]   If nothing else,
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:49.680]   today's discussion ought to illuminate the fact
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:53.880]   that some strict recommendation of salt intake
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.760]   cannot be made universally across the board for everybody.
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:59.360]   There's just simply no way that could be done.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.240]   And yet I think most of what we've learned about salt
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.680]   in the general discussions around health
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.940]   are that it's this evil substance.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.340]   Nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.980]   It's an incredible substance.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.480]   Our physiology is dependent on it.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:16.200]   Our cognition is dependent on it.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.920]   Indeed, our mental and physical health and our performance
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.960]   in essentially all aspects of life is dependent on it.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:24.180]   And I hope I've been able to illuminate
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.040]   some of the beautiful ways in which the brain
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.880]   and the bodily organs interact
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.640]   in order to help us regulate this thing
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:31.080]   that we call sodium balance.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.180]   And the fact that we have neurons in our brain
[02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:37.520]   that are both tuned to the levels of salt in our body
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.120]   and positioned in a location in the brain
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.920]   that allows them to detect the levels of salt in our body
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:46.120]   and to drive the intake of more or less salt
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.880]   and more or less fluid and other electrolytes
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.460]   really just points to the beauty of the system
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:52.760]   that we've all evolved
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:54.700]   that allows us to interact with our environment
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:57.140]   and make adjustments according to the context
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.960]   of our daily and ongoing life.

[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:35.800]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:38.040]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.480]   We also have a Patreon.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:42.380]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:44.160]   and there you can support the podcast
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:45.700]   at any level that you like.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:48.100]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:51.540]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.720]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.940]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:02:00.240]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus and so on.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.640]   One issue with supplements, however,
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:04.700]   is that the quality of supplements varies tremendously
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:06.200]   from one brand to the next.
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.220]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:10.940]   because Thorne supplements
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:13.080]   are of the absolute highest quality
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.840]   in terms of the ingredients they include
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:17.180]   and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:19.360]   they include, meaning what's listed on the bottle
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.000]   is what's actually contained in that product.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.820]   They've partnered with all the major sports teams
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:26.540]   and with the Mayo Clinic, so trust is very, very high
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:28.740]   with respect to the quality of Thorne products.
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:31.020]   If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:36.020]   you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:39.860]   and you can get 20% off any of those Thorne supplements.
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.380]   In addition, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:45.900]   through that portal, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.080]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.560]   that Thorne makes.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.360]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.720]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:57.180]   There, I cover science and science-based tools
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:00.120]   that sometimes overlaps with the content of this podcast,
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.700]   but sometimes is distinct from the content of this podcast.
[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:06.020]   We also have a neural network newsletter.
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:08.300]   The neural network newsletter comes out once a month.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:09.800]   It is zero cost.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.580]   You sign up for it by providing your email.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:13.880]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:15.940]   The privacy policy is made very clear,
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:17.880]   and you can sign up for the neural network newsletter
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:19.860]   by going to hubermanlab.com.
[02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:22.600]   Just go into the menu, scroll down to neural network,
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.620]   and you can sign up.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:24.740]   And even without signing up,
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.820]   you can access some of the previous newsletters
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:28.680]   if you'd like to see what they are like.
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.020]   We include short summaries from podcasts,
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.500]   some key takeaways, and some resources and tools
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.540]   that you won't find anywhere else.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:37.440]   Thank you once again for joining me today
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:40.660]   to discuss the neuroscience and the physiology
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:43.640]   around salt and its many incredible influences
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:45.140]   on our brain and body.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:47.520]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.380]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:51.960]   [upbeat music]
