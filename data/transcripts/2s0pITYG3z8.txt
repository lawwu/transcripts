[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   The slowing down the actual physical task of writing
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.600]   turned out to have very little to do with the rate
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.780]   at which I actually produced quality work.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.120]   And so, aha, I had one of these deep question style
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.000]   light bulbs go off, an aha moment,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.720]   and it brought up a question
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.860]   I wanted to dive deeper into today.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.760]   I wanna make today's deep question,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.080]   does working faster make work better?
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.080]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.420]   the show about living and working deeply
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.760]   in a distracted world.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.500]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.580]   joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.000]   Jesse, I gotta tell you, the marketing worked.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.400]   I have ordered a remarkable tablet.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.240]   - Nice, when's it come in?
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.800]   - It takes a long time, Monday.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.840]   - When'd you order it?
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.400]   - I ordered it on like Tuesday.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.240]   - So, six days?
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.560]   - Yeah, okay, not that long,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.480]   but still, it feels like long in today's world.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.000]   I expect to, by Monday afternoon,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.320]   to be looking thoughtfully towards a window
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.120]   as sunshine shines on my face
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.320]   before someone comes over
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   with really expensive looking glasses on
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.240]   and looks down at the remarkable with me
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.280]   where there'll be a chart
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.120]   that'll draw a circle around something.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.680]   'Cause as I've learned from the videos
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.280]   that market the remarkable,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   it's a lot of looking into the sunshine
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   and drawing arrows and circling charts
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.000]   while people look thoughtfully over your shoulder.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.440]   So, I look forward to be doing that for hours.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.360]   - Everything has charts.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.720]   - Mine just charts, just circling charts.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.280]   People be like, "That's it?
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.320]   "You have turned this business around."
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.640]   - You've solved interest rates and inflation.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.960]   - A lot of high fives.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.360]   Yeah, you have solved inflation.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.760]   There will be no more viruses.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.040]   We just didn't think that,
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   there's nothing drawing our attention
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.960]   like an arrow to this particular bar in the bar chart.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.640]   And now that you've done so on the remarkable,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.880]   it all makes sense.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   So, I'll report back.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.920]   I'll report back to everyone how it works,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.760]   why I'm getting it.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.680]   I did a thing before.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.320]   Basically, I have a lot of different notebooks I use
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.920]   for capturing ideas or early work
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.560]   on many different types of projects
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.160]   'cause I have many different hats I wear.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.080]   And so, the idea of having one thing
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.720]   to contain all that information,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.120]   not seven or eight different paper notebooks,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.600]   and to have that be something
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.480]   that is no internet connection,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.320]   it's just for doing that, and it backs up.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.120]   Anyways, I think it could be good for me or not.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.000]   I'll report back.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.160]   Speaking of devices, Jesse,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   another thing that happened in my world of digital work,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.040]   less nice, less sunshine on my face
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.120]   and people look over my shoulder proudly,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.480]   is on my trusty laptop,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.320]   I got something stuck under my shift key,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.400]   the left-hand shift key.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.240]   I don't know what it was.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.680]   Something got under there,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.880]   which means 50 to 75% of the time
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.360]   I would press the shift key, it wouldn't work.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.400]   So, you have to just stop
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.240]   and just keep trying it again and again
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.200]   to get every capital letter capitalized.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   So, it's annoying.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.040]   It was, okay, I can't just go at full speed.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.360]   I have to stop and keep doing this thing.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.280]   I brought it up, though,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.200]   because that actually sent me down a rabbit hole
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.160]   that I wanted to explore a little bit on today's show,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.120]   because what I noticed was,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.080]   man, I can't write literally as fast
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.520]   if my shift key doesn't work very well,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.400]   'cause I have to keep stopping and trying to make it work.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   But this slowness that was infused into my writing
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.560]   had no impact on the overall rate
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.120]   at which I was producing good work.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.240]   I was working on an article last week.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.220]   That was annoying,
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.360]   but it had no impact on,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.160]   did I finish a draft of this article or not?
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.760]   The slowing down the actual physical task of writing
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.440]   turned out to have very little to do
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.400]   with the rate at which I actually produced quality work.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.680]   And so, aha, I had one of these deep question style
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.600]   light bulbs go off, an aha moment,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.320]   and it brought up a question
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.240]   I wanted to dive deeper into today.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.320]   So, I wanna make today's deep question,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.760]   does working faster make work better?
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.020]   And so, the way I'm gonna structure my thoughts
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.080]   is we'll take as our starting premise here,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.900]   work-related productivity systems or tools.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.880]   So, all the different things that might enter our life,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.000]   the remarkable tablet I was just talking about,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   complicated productivity software,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.500]   notebooks, calendars, systems, like bullet journaling,
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.660]   this whole universe of systems and tools
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.940]   related to productivity,
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.860]   and I wanna divide them into three categories.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.220]   And I think by dividing them into three categories
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.720]   and understanding the purpose of each category,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.880]   we're gonna have a more nuanced understanding
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.260]   of what really improves work
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.220]   when it comes to these type of productivity ideas
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.460]   and what doesn't really matter much.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   Why, in other words,
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.260]   would I spend a lot of money on a remarkable tablet,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.340]   but be okay that the shift key didn't work on my laptop
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.720]   and my rate of writing got much slower?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.360]   All right, so that's what I wanna do today.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.460]   So, let me start with the first of these three
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.300]   major categories of productivity systems and tools,
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.960]   and that would be those that add capabilities.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.500]   So, a system or tool that enables you to do something
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.960]   work-related that you were not able to do
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.360]   before you got that tool.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.820]   Let's say you buy a notebook
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.780]   that allows you to work on book ideas.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.220]   You're a writer.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.980]   You have a notebook that allows you to capture
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.500]   and elaborate book ideas
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.460]   when you're away from your office.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.460]   That's something you weren't able to do before,
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.660]   but this new tool makes something newly possible.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.760]   Oh, I can now capture thoughts in more locations.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   This is the way I think, for example,
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.580]   of the remarkable tablet that I just ordered
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.300]   is it makes it possible for me to have access
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.220]   to a dedicated idea notebook
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.520]   for all of the various different types of work I do.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.020]   So, we have theoretical computer science proofs.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.580]   We have sort of academic work on digital ethics.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.500]   We have article writing, like New Yorker pieces, et cetera.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.160]   We have the sort of Moleskine deep lifestyle notebook
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.100]   where you're thinking about
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.540]   general reflections on your life.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.900]   And there's the notebook that has to do
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.700]   with the media company, the business that I run.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.460]   I can't bring a notebook for all of those things with me.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.820]   That would be a giant stack of notebooks.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.500]   I can bring a remarkable with me.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.880]   So, that's something I couldn't do before
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   that I will be able to do when I have a remarkable.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.260]   Have access to a unique notebook
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.740]   for six or seven different things
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.820]   in which I need to collect notes.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.080]   The introduction of the internet was a big capability adder
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.820]   when it came along in the '90s and early 2000s,
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   because now, for example, you could look up
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.500]   almost any piece of information that you need access to,
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.180]   you can get immediately.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.060]   You couldn't do that before you had,
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.980]   let's say an early form of Google and the internet.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.780]   Now you can.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.300]   So, that's a system that adds new capabilities.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.960]   A subscription to Audible,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.020]   that allows you to listen to books
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.840]   when you're doing other things.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.020]   So, before you had an audiobook subscription,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.260]   you couldn't do that, right?
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.480]   So, it's a tool or system that gave you a new capability
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.840]   that you did not have before.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.940]   So, that's the first category
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   of productivity-related systems and tools.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   And in general, these can be very useful improvements
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.700]   if the new capability it adds
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.280]   connects to something you value
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.860]   or significantly increases the valuable things
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.860]   you can produce, it's a bit of a no-brainer.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.800]   Yeah, keep your eye out for those.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.180]   All right, well, there's a second category
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.580]   of productivity systems and tools.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.800]   That is those that reduce pain points.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.000]   So, a system or tool that reduces or eliminates an activity
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.600]   that you actively dislike or makes you unhappy.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.460]   Pain points are the type of activities
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.380]   that can aggregate over time towards exhaustion or burnout.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.200]   So, you have to be careful about pain points
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.460]   and oftentimes, there will be some sort of tool or system
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.660]   that can help you eliminate those.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.800]   So, let me give you an example here.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.860]   When I first started TA-ing college classes,
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.340]   so as a graduate student at MIT,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.020]   I was mainly on a research assistantship,
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.420]   but you're required in MIT
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.980]   to do some teaching assistantships as well,
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.500]   so you get more exposed to teaching.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.140]   I remember the first class I TA-ed was a big class,
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.780]   a big distributed algorithms class,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.540]   you know, MIT, course six is large,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.500]   there's a lot of students in these classes.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.140]   And the obligations I had in that class as a TA,
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.500]   I remember had multiple pain points,
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.300]   including those surrounding the dealing with problem sets.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.220]   So, when I first came into that class,
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.620]   you had everyone submitting problem set solutions
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.940]   in any format they wanted.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.580]   So, handwritten or printed, often stapled,
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.740]   and sort of haphazardly submitted.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.980]   And my advisor, the teacher I was doing
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.620]   a teaching assistantship for said,
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.700]   "Well, look, we gotta have Xerox copies of everything
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.300]   in case we lose one."
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.540]   And so, I found myself spending all this time
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.420]   removing staples, wrangling, we'd have 50 problem sets,
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.500]   wrangling somewhere on one side, somewhere on other,
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.860]   someone to go through the copying machine,
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.540]   trying to make all these copies,
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.900]   getting them off the graders,
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.540]   then getting them sorted again, et cetera.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.620]   And at some point I realized,
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.580]   there is a system I can introduce here
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.140]   that would reduce that pain point
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.540]   without causing any significant trouble.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.660]   And I said, "Actually, students,
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.940]   I'm gonna standardize how we hand in problem sets.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.260]   It's gonna be no staples, single-sided,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.300]   standard size paper,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.460]   and you're gonna come up the class at the beginning
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.780]   to hand these in, we need them alphabetical."
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.060]   So you look at the problem sets that are already handed in
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.940]   and put yours where it goes,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.740]   so that when you're done handing in your problem sets,
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.660]   we'll already have them in alphabetical order.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.100]   That reduced almost all the pain points,
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.620]   'cause I can now just take this big stack
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.740]   and I could run it through the copier
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.100]   and it took 15 minutes.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.860]   Everything was already ordered alphabetically,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.540]   so I could just pull off this third,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.060]   give it to this TA, this third, that TA,
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.900]   this third, that TA,
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.260]   and they could bring them back alphabetically, graders,
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   and they could bring them back alphabetically
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.100]   when they're done.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.940]   These were little things,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.900]   but they got rid of a lot of big pain points for me.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.140]   And for the students, who cares?
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.340]   Like, they don't, I won't staple it
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.420]   and take 30 extra seconds when I hand it in.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.060]   For each individual student, it made very little difference,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.740]   but for me, that new system eliminated a major pain point.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.300]   Another example might be,
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.260]   and again, this kind of comes from my own life,
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.060]   but imagine you are something like a director
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.580]   of graduate studies at a university.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.700]   I'm just sort of pulling this example out of nowhere,
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.180]   right, everyone?
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.940]   But imagine you're a director of graduate studies
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.020]   at a computer science program,
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.300]   and I don't know, like at a Jesuit university
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.140]   in like Washington, DC or something like that,
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:05.980]   near the Potomac.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.140]   (laughs)
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.260]   It's been around since like the 1780s.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.540]   So just hypothetically.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.040]   Anyways, one of the responsibilities
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.020]   that someone in this situation might have
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.900]   is needing to sign add/drop forms
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.780]   for when graduate students want to add a course
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.220]   that they couldn't just sign up for normally.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.500]   And there's these forms where you have to get a signature
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.540]   from the professor,
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.660]   and then you have to get a signature
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.940]   from the director as well to approve it.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.460]   So imagine hypothetically,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.580]   these forms came in all the time.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.060]   People would just bring them to your office,
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.100]   sometimes with the professor's signature, sometimes not.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.580]   You would have to scan them, sign them and scan them,
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.460]   and submit the electronic version,
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.980]   and file the other version,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.100]   or give it back to the students,
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.500]   go get the professor and bring it back.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.660]   And this is all fine if you have, let's say,
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.500]   I don't know, three of these a semester,
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.860]   but imagine instead you have dozens, right?
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.740]   A major pain point.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.220]   But it turns out this is another place
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.260]   where you could put in place some tools and systems
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.580]   that will specifically reduce that pain point.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.420]   So for example, in this instance,
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.980]   there could be new rules for the students.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.880]   Okay, here's how it works.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.900]   Get your form, get the professor to sign it,
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.980]   then scan your form, okay?
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.140]   And then you are going to email that scanned form to me,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.400]   or even better, put that scanned form in a shared folder,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.620]   Box is what Georgetown used, but it could be Google Drive,
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.820]   it could be Dropbox, it's forms to be signed.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.900]   And then once a week, the director in this case
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.660]   could go to that box, take these already digital files,
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.880]   pull the digital signature onto them,
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.620]   and move them over to a signed shared folder.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.380]   The instruction to the students is,
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.140]   he does this on Fridays, check back in after Friday
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.940]   to get your signed version.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.040]   You can directly submit it to the registrar's office.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.500]   Here's how you do it, and you CC the director
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.180]   and put this in the subject line,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.940]   so that message will automatically get filtered,
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.580]   but he'll then have a record of it.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.060]   But now you have reduced everything
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.100]   the director has to do in this
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.940]   from a ad hoc ongoing sort of annoying wrangling of papers
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.020]   and scans and people and submissions,
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.140]   to once a week, he goes to a folder,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.860]   opens 10 documents, drags signatures, moves them.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.980]   It takes seven minutes.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.820]   Again, the extra work for the students here is minor.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.380]   For each individual student, it means nothing.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.180]   But for the professor, the director in this case,
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.740]   it's a reduction of a major pain point.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.340]   Reducing pain points in my opinion
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.900]   is almost always a worthy endeavor
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.900]   and a great application of productivity tools and systems.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.260]   It makes your work way more sustainable
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.380]   because it's not just the pain you feel
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.700]   from these activities in the moment,
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.020]   but the aggregation of that pain day after day,
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.440]   week after week that can really cause burnout.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.180]   This then brings us to the third category
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.140]   of productivity systems and tools,
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:09.140]   and that is those that speed up common tasks.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.220]   So take something you're already doing
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.320]   and simply try to make it faster or more efficient.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.220]   This typically is through the use
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.460]   of new high technology tools.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.660]   So for example, Zapier Automations.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.380]   I can now, when doing some sort of activity,
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.500]   have an automation on my computer where I press a button
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.380]   and it takes this file and renames it
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.420]   and automatically moves it over there.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.360]   So you can start to automate some of the digital movement
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.280]   of information on your machine.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.740]   Something like autocompletes in an email client
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.780]   like Gmail does.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.460]   That's an example of this category
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.840]   of productivity tools or system.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.580]   I'm typing a common phrase.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.960]   It finishes it for me.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.220]   It saves me some time typing it.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.980]   I'm typing an address in the to field in an email
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.540]   and it automatically suggests the name
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.380]   and I can click on it
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.820]   and that saves me a little bit of time.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.860]   Tightly integrated note capture technologies
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.680]   fall into this.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.220]   I have a complicated Evernote type setup
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.540]   where I wanna just very easily have this workflow
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   where I can take all this different type of information
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.180]   that gets sucked into this one system
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.200]   where it gets labeled and I can view it in different views.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.260]   If you look at productivity YouTube,
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.120]   there's a real focus on this category
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.760]   of productivity tools and systems.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.120]   I've taken these things I do
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.440]   and they're all hooked up and integrated and automated
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.800]   and I've reduced the number of clicks I need to do.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.500]   I've reduced the number of typing I need to do.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.040]   Everything moves really quickly to where it needs to go
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.220]   with minimum input from me.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.440]   So here's the thing about this final category
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.000]   of productivity tools and systems.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.040]   They can sometimes be useful
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.800]   largely where they overlap with pain point reduction.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.420]   So these are techniques you could use
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.200]   for pain point reduction.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.540]   But for the most part,
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.540]   their impact on your actual output is minor.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:04.000]   So it comes to producing things of value using your mind,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.180]   typically the bottleneck,
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.140]   the thing that's going to control
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.780]   how long something takes or how good the thing is,
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.180]   is typically deep work.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.100]   It's this thinking deeply to come up with the right idea
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.200]   and then the application of an expertise driven craft
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.320]   to produce a valuable product on the other side.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.200]   This is where most of the time is taken up.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.720]   This is the main thing that determines the value.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.800]   The speed up type productivity hacks
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.600]   work on the margins of that.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   They work on the gathering of the information.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.520]   They work on the taking the article after you writing it
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.920]   and automatically getting it uploaded to your newsletter
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.800]   with saving some clicks.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.280]   So they save time on the margins,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.800]   the intake and the output,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.180]   but not in the core activity
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.980]   that actually determines most of the time
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.340]   something takes and most of the quality of what you produce.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.200]   This is why when we went the other way with my shift key,
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.000]   instead of making a common task faster,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.600]   we made a common task slower,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.800]   it didn't impact the quality of the writing I did that week
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.960]   or the overall rate at which I produced that writing
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.760]   because typing was not the bottleneck.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.720]   My bottleneck when writing a magazine article
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.160]   is not if only I could move my fingers faster on the key.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.600]   I'm staring at this screen.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.940]   I might rewrite the same sentence four times
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.220]   in a five minute area.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.740]   A lot of writing is walking.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.860]   How do I make this work?
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.780]   Why isn't this working?
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.020]   A lot of writing is revising.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.040]   The speed of the typing negligible, right?
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.440]   That's nice.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.700]   That's not what determines how long
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.120]   that task is going to take.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.600]   And this is true for most cognitive activities
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.900]   that produce thing of real value
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.220]   is that the bottleneck is the thinking.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.940]   The determiner of the value is the thinking.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.660]   And that can't be sped up
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.160]   with productivity systems or hacks.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.820]   So now if we consider the first two categories,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.600]   we see, okay, these are still valuable
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.860]   because they're not actually trying to increase the speed
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.420]   at which you produce valuable information.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.620]   When you're reducing pain points,
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.680]   no, you're trying to stop yourself from burning out.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.540]   That's worthy.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.560]   When you're adding new capabilities,
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.840]   you're giving new targets for your energy to focus on.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.340]   And that too could be really useful.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.900]   Or you're adding new inputs into the work you're doing
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.460]   that you did not have before.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.140]   So that could open up new possibilities
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.260]   for what you produce.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.100]   That could be really useful as well.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.000]   So there's value in those first two categories that is clear.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.600]   The value in the third category is more tentative.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.840]   It's sometimes applies, sometimes not.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.940]   This third category, however,
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.740]   is what most people think of
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.060]   when they think about personal productivity.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.460]   As mentioned, this third category
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.000]   is what dominates productivity YouTube.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.860]   There's a, it's great content.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.100]   There's great satisfaction.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.140]   Look at how all these pieces click together
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.900]   and everything automates from here to there.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.980]   It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.220]   It's like getting a woodworking product project
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.260]   to actually work and all the pieces fit together.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.940]   It's satisfying in the moment,
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.200]   but again, it has very little to do
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.740]   with the actual production of value.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.580]   It's why there's a sense of emptiness
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.620]   that pervades a lot of classic productivity content
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.440]   is because people who do actually wrangle
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.660]   with hard things for their lives say,
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.680]   this is really unrelated to what I do.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.140]   You look at Aaron Sorkin
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.700]   writing a script or something like that.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.020]   It doesn't really matter if he's using Final Draft or not,
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.300]   or has good macros, or whether or not
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.740]   he has a complicated Scrivener setup
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.420]   that he's using when using Final Draft.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.100]   I mean, it all might matter a little bit to him
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.000]   in terms of efficiency or annoyance,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.540]   but it has no impact
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.340]   on whether that movie script gets written or not,
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.540]   or whether or not that script wins an Oscar.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.060]   So I think it's useful to make these category distinctions
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.120]   because it gives us two important conclusions.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.740]   One, there is a lot within the world
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.000]   of productivity systems and tools
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.980]   that we should not be dismissive of.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.980]   Even the most late-stage capitalist anti-work,
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.220]   subscribe to my sub stack about why you shouldn't
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.080]   go in the business, whatever crowd that's out there,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.300]   will should admit that this is not all just
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.900]   guys with slicked back haircuts on YouTube
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.420]   trying to get you to automate the way that files move
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.820]   from your Dropbox into your tablet setup.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.680]   Pain points and capability addition,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.760]   these might not be sexy, but they're very important
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.960]   and they can make a real difference on the quality of work.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   And the other conclusion we have to draw here
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.300]   is that just speeding things up by itself
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.700]   is working at the margins of knowledge production,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.560]   at the margins of value production.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.860]   If it's fun to you, it's a fine hobby,
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.240]   but don't let it get in the way of that actual work.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.640]   So anyways, I think this distinction,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.760]   I'm a big ontology guy.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.960]   I think having these distinctions helps navigate
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.500]   this increasingly contentious and complicated world
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.980]   of understanding productivity.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.820]   Is it evil?
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.640]   Is it good?
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.480]   Is it useful?
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.320]   Is it a mirage?
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.420]   And the answer is yes, yes, yes, and yes.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.720]   It's all of these things.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.520]   And only with these right categories
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.240]   can we better navigate those inherent internal complexities.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.520]   So at least that's the way I'm trying to think now
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.600]   about the world of productivity advice.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.080]   - So you're gonna fix your keyboard?
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.920]   - My system for this is just keep using
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.960]   until it gets better.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.560]   And I think it's better now.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.120]   It's better than it was.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.400]   People say you can take the key off.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.940]   I'm telling you, if I take a key off,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.600]   that thing's not getting back on.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.400]   You know, it's like some plastic things
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.600]   that have to click on just right,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.360]   and I worry that I'll never get it back on again.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.400]   - How often do you have to get new computers?
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.720]   - I mean, I have a lot of computers.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.560]   It just depends.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.480]   Like my Georgetown machines,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.520]   they replace every three years, I think.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.120]   - But your Georgetown machines have the keyboard imprints
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:32.960]   on the fingers?
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.780]   - Yeah.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.620]   - They do?
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.440]   - Yeah.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.600]   - Oh, so you write on them all like that?
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.440]   - Yeah.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.280]   - Oh, wow.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.100]   - Yeah, well, I often write on my,
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.280]   my laptop is often my Georgetown machine.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.460]   We have some other laptops,
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.800]   but I usually just try to use one machine on the go.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.160]   - The one that we showed a picture of?
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.080]   - That's a Georgetown laptop.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.920]   - Oh, okay.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.740]   - Yeah. - Okay, that makes sense.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.580]   - That's a Georgetown laptop, yeah.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.080]   And I have various desktops
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.280]   and a pile of tablets this tall.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.580]   And yeah, we have some computers here in the HQ.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.080]   - I thought you had multiple laptops.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.040]   - We do have multiple laptops,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.340]   I usually just try to use one.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.180]   - Yeah.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.980]   - Yeah, all of my files are in Dropbox
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.700]   in a synchronized shared directory structure.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.200]   So it doesn't really matter which computer I'm using,
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.260]   they all have the same files.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.020]   And the only program I use that's not web-based
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.660]   is typically Scrivener.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.980]   But all my Scrivener files are in Dropbox,
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.700]   so I don't have to worry about losing them.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.300]   All right, so anyways, we have some questions coming up.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.700]   These questions all very roughly are going to orbit
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.260]   around the same issue of sort of productivity hacks
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.020]   and the tension between speeding things up
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.260]   or actually doing better work
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.060]   and where this stuff is useful
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.340]   and where we're just deluding ourselves.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.300]   So we'll sort of apply what we just discussed
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.940]   with a bunch of real world questions to follow.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.180]   First, however, I wanna mention one of our sponsors
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.180]   that makes the show possible.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.180]   And that is our friends at Grammarly,
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.560]   our longtime sponsors at Grammarly.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.740]   What I'm excited about now
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.260]   is a new product feature they have called Grammarly Go.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.140]   So those who have followed my writing,
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.100]   let's say for "The New Yorker"
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.260]   knows that I've been reporting recently
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.660]   on breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.420]   And my stance on this tends to be
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.700]   what you should be looking for is focused applications
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.980]   of these new artificial intelligence technologies.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.620]   This is how it's gonna enter our life,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.360]   is in very focused but very effective applications,
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.720]   not as some sort of big general new intelligence
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.960]   that just does everything for you.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.240]   And Grammarly Go is an example
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.680]   of exactly this type of useful way forward
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.860]   with these tools that I've been talking about.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.060]   It brings the general power of large language model power
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.860]   to generative artificial intelligence
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.960]   to the very specific task of my professional writing,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.080]   I do as a knowledge worker
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.060]   in various apps for various purposes.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.300]   So with Grammarly Go, it's like you have a assistant
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.020]   that can sit here and make your writing better
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.660]   and help that writing go faster.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.640]   So one of the things you can do with Grammarly Go,
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.440]   for example, is ask for prompts.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.920]   You can say, "Hey, can you outline some ideas
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.160]   on how to decorate a taco truck?"
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.460]   Or like, "What's an outline?
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.580]   Give me a rough outline for a business plan
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.140]   for my yoga studio."
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.740]   Or "I need 10 possible captions
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.080]   for this post I just wrote over here."
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.880]   All of this is stuff that's gonna save you time.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.960]   Oh, great, now I have a rough draft
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.160]   of something I can edit off of.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.520]   I can look at a list of captions and say,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   "Hey, this one's pretty good."
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.040]   Number seven, let me just edit it a little bit.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.720]   So it's as if you have a writing assistant
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.880]   that you can task with doing things
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.320]   that help you complete your writing project better.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.200]   It also can work with tone.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.520]   So this underlying technology, as we know,
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.640]   is very good at language and the structure of language
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.280]   and the different variants of language.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.960]   So now you can say things to it,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.920]   such as, "Okay, I just wrote a paragraph.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.240]   Can you make this sound more exciting?"
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.080]   Or, and I think this is critical,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.280]   "Can you make this sound more professional?"
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.480]   And it'll take what you wrote and just update the tone
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.960]   into something that matches it.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.080]   In fact, the new Grammarly Go offering here
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.720]   allows you to customize your preferred
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.360]   style of communication.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.680]   They have a setting called Set Voice
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.240]   that allows you to actually customize the voice you want
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.520]   in your professional communication.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.700]   So when you ask it to summarize something
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.620]   or to write a paragraph about something,
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.640]   it'll do so already in your voice.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.180]   You don't have to really work on this
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.860]   to make it sound less like commander data from Star Trek.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.400]   It'll actually already by default sound like you.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.160]   These are the type of applications in the genre of AI
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.320]   that I think are important, focused,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.140]   solving a real problem.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.440]   So I think you will be amazed at what you can do now
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.480]   with Grammarly Go.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.560]   So go to grammarly.com/go
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.120]   to download and learn more about Grammarly Go.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   That's G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/go.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   I also wanna talk about our friends at Policy Genius.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.820]   If you have a family, you need life insurance.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.940]   If something happens to you,
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.640]   you wanna make sure that they are taken care of.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.780]   A lot of people say,
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.780]   well, you know, I got some life insurance through my work.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.780]   What do I have to care about it?
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.620]   And then you go and you look up
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.180]   how much life insurance you have from your work
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.020]   and you realize, oh,
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.900]   that would get my family through one month.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.740]   So you need life insurance if you have a family.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.300]   If you think you have life insurance,
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.180]   like through your employer,
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.700]   you probably need a lot more.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.340]   So why don't you go ahead and get this?
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.860]   It's not because it's expensive,
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.580]   especially if we're talking term life insurance
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.960]   and you're relatively young,
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.660]   it's because you don't know how to get started.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.860]   This is where Policy Genius enters the scene.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.740]   Policy Genius was built to modernize
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   the life insurance industry.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.880]   Their technology makes it easy to compare life insurance
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.460]   quote, from America's top insurers in just a few clicks
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.580]   to find your lowest price.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.160]   With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.780]   that start at just $25 per month
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.740]   for a million dollars of coverage.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.100]   Some options offering coverage in as little as a week
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.140]   and avoid unnecessary medical exams.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.500]   They work with licensed agents
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.780]   to help you find the best fit for your needs.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.860]   Policy Genius works for you,
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.540]   not for the insurance companies.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.800]   They don't have an incentive
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.660]   to recommend one insurer over another.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.700]   Their incentive is to make you as satisfied as possible
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.420]   with the policy that you get.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.580]   Policy Genius is for parents and for caregivers
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.700]   or for anyone else who has to depend on them.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.620]   They simplify the process of getting life insurance
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.460]   so you can protect the people you love.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.720]   No added fees, personal data is kept private.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.820]   There are thousands of five-star reviews
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.900]   on Google and Trustpilot of satisfied customers.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.140]   So your loved ones deserve a financial safety net.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.500]   You deserve a smarter way to try to find and buy it.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.220]   Head to policygenius.com or click the link in the show notes
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.560]   to get your free life insurance quotes
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.860]   and see how much you could save.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.340]   That's policygenius.com.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.700]   All right, Jesse, let's get into the weeds here.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.460]   Do some questions.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.740]   People are talking about productivity, nuts and bolts,
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.940]   and we can try to put our new framework
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.460]   for thinking about these tools and systems to use.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.860]   - All right, first question's from Mark.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.940]   I noticed that you seem to think tools don't matter
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.940]   when it comes to how productive you can become.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.780]   Meanwhile, most other productivity YouTubers insist
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.340]   that choosing and using the top 10 productivity apps
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.100]   is the number one thing
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.020]   to optimizing productivity and efficiency.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.460]   Thoughts?
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.100]   - Well, so Mark, it's a great question
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.900]   because it shows off exactly the framework
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.660]   that we just talked about in the deep dive.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.620]   I'm a big believer in personal productivity
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.620]   as being important.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.500]   I'm also very different seeming
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.560]   than typical productivity YouTubers,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.940]   and it all comes down to those three categories
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.500]   into which we can sort any discussion
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.740]   of productivity tools and systems.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.020]   So I'm a big believer in productivity tools and systems
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.420]   to add new capabilities to your life.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.300]   I'm a big believer of productivity tools and systems
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.620]   to reduce pain points.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.640]   I don't care as much about using these tools and systems
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.180]   to speed up the common task
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.620]   at the margins of actual knowledge production.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.500]   This is what productivity YouTubers typically do look at.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.620]   Complicated integrations of systems
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.180]   that are made to speed up the steps
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.700]   that surround the actual bottle neck of thinking hard,
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.620]   come with new ideas, producing original knowledge.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.080]   There's a reason why they focus on that in YouTube
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.900]   is because, well, first of all, it makes for good content.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.100]   I really think there's a similar thing going on
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.720]   with a lot of these productivity YouTube videos
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.660]   that you would see with a lot of,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.460]   let's say YouTube cooking videos.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.180]   There's something really fulfilling
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.660]   when you see people start with these various ingredients
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.140]   and they grind it and do whatever.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.220]   And in the end, they get this finished pie
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.140]   or this really well prepared cup of coffee
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.540]   with the cream just right on the top.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.080]   It's visually very appealing,
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.500]   but also it is cognitively appealing.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.380]   Our brain likes to see pieces come together
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.060]   into a nice whole.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.560]   And so it is essentially productivity cooking
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.180]   when you see this integration of this tool to that tool.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.660]   And the person shows how everything
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.060]   automatically populates and this syncs with that.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.240]   And it goes to this tool and over here,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.980]   I can write here and it updates over there.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.020]   It's like producing a pie.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.240]   It's good content.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.740]   The other types of categories of productivity systems
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.480]   and tools is not so good content.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.380]   A video rapidly cut of someone changing the policy
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.380]   by which their students submit problem sets
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.200]   so they don't have to spend so much time at the copier
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.800]   is not that exciting.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.420]   Watching a director of graduate studies
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.980]   figure out how to cut steps out of the process
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.420]   of approving add drop requests.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.200]   That's just not that exciting.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.620]   It's often very bespoke
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.680]   and the solutions often aren't that interesting.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.440]   They don't require advanced tools.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.680]   They don't require breakthroughs in technology.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.200]   You're not wearing a virtual reality helmet
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.600]   as you interact with a large language model generative AI
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.120]   using haptic feedback goggles.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.840]   You're typically sending someone an email
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.920]   and saying put this in Dropbox by Friday.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.620]   Again, it's not as exciting.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.560]   Now here's the thing.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.320]   I don't mind the speeding up thing.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.960]   I mean, I think it's interesting content.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.160]   I think a lot of people like it.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.920]   I think this is often missed
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.400]   by the anti productivity critics.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.800]   What they miss is when they look at this content
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.760]   is they try to extrapolate that or generalize that
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.680]   to be this is productivity.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.100]   And the message here is that everyone should be doing this.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.680]   But really when you look at that type
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.040]   of specialized YouTube productivity content,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.160]   again, it's like looking at someone who does unboxing
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.480]   or cooking and you wouldn't look at someone
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.760]   who had a cooking channel
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.400]   where they really carefully prepare these things
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.720]   and say like, well, this is,
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.920]   we shouldn't all be obsessed about cooking all the time.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.040]   And it's not, this is just big cooking,
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.240]   trying to get us obsessed about cooking.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.080]   It's not, there's like some people like to watch that.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.680]   It's much more specific and narrow
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.440]   than I think critics actually give it credit for.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.920]   Also, I don't know, some people enjoy speeding up things
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.760]   on the margin.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.440]   Sometimes it gives you a faster cognitive runway
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.760]   into the deep work.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.800]   If I have a really clean setup
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.520]   that gets everything just ready for me to start writing,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.320]   it's not actually going to change
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.800]   how long it takes me to write something.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.560]   It's not gonna make my writing better,
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.780]   but maybe it makes it 20% easier to get started writing.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.020]   And again, that's an advantage that could add up as well.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.680]   So I have nothing against focusing on speeding up
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.360]   the margins with these productivity hacks and tools.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   I just think it's important that we recognize
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.680]   that this is just one avenue out of many
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.040]   that make up the map that is thinking about productivity
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.560]   and its potential impact on your life.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.200]   So I do do things different
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.480]   than those productivity YouTubers
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.800]   because I just don't look as much at that one category,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.780]   but we're all dealing with the same, I guess, general topic,
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.300]   which is how you organize your information
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.820]   and organize and set up your professional actions.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.800]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.920]   - Next question is from Andrew.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.080]   I work for a government contractor.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.720]   They have a strict device policy
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.000]   that bans third-party apps and platforms
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.120]   such as Trello for productivity.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.060]   I am depressed I will never be as efficient
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.720]   and deep as people working for other companies.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.780]   What should I do?
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.700]   - Again, this question highlights some themes
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.560]   that we have been hitting on here.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.280]   What it's doing, I believe,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.840]   is conflating the type of things you see in particular
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.000]   in that third category of productivity tools and systems,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.380]   speeding up common tasks,
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.180]   and conflating that with producing good work.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.160]   That somehow the better suited my systems and tools,
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.820]   the faster the steps related to the work I do,
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.480]   the more integrated the tools are with my work,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.980]   the better I'm gonna produce,
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.200]   the better quality work I can produce,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.280]   the faster I can produce work,
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.440]   and often that's not the case.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.480]   In the end, you have to write the report.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.240]   The chapter has to get prepared.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.600]   The business strategy has to come together.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.840]   The team, you have to understand what's going on
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.580]   and figure out the plan that's gonna properly manage them
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.900]   towards meeting their objectives.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.560]   And that's what's gonna eat up most of the time.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.240]   And that again is gonna be you thinking.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.200]   Tools aren't gonna help or,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.560]   I was gonna say it can't help or hurt.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   They could hurt if you're looking at your phone at TikTok
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.780]   while trying to think up these big thoughts,
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.700]   they will actually hurt,
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.720]   but there's only so much the tools can help you there.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.800]   So Andrew, what I'm trying to say here
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.760]   is you don't have to despair
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.680]   that you don't have access to particular tools
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.400]   that you see various people use as part of their systems,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.960]   just build systems that work for you.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.380]   And what you really wanna focus on here,
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.600]   again, is reducing pain points and adding new capabilities.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.440]   And I wouldn't worry as much about,
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.720]   and do I have everything integrated and as fast as possible,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.760]   because that doesn't matter as much.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.740]   And once you know what you're trying to do,
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.080]   the specifics of the tools will often matter
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.520]   less than you think.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.880]   Once you know in general, okay,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.000]   here's the process I wanna use for whatever,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.040]   this particular type of report
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.520]   that I have to work on week after week,
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.640]   98% of the time, you'll realize that email
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.320]   plus basic file sharing, plus just talking to people
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.360]   and coming up with an operating procedure is what you need.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.400]   Rare is the case where you really do need
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.240]   a bespoke piece of third-party software
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.600]   to actually do that work.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.760]   So Andrew, you don't have to worry so much.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.240]   This is more boring than you think.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   Use the basic tools you have access to, that's fine.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.800]   Have a process-oriented mindset
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.380]   and just be looking for pain points you can eliminate.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.680]   Look for new capabilities, new sources of information,
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.240]   et cetera, new tools that allow you
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.360]   to do something you couldn't do before.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.480]   Okay, care about that.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.960]   But when it comes to these tightly integrated systems
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.160]   where everything moves very quickly and connects,
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.280]   it doesn't matter that much that you don't have it
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.920]   if you're focusing on the other pieces.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.360]   Basic tools can be used to build
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.500]   really complicated productivity structures.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.420]   I mean, I like Trello, Jesse, he mentioned Trello,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.860]   but I don't think it would have any impact at all
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.260]   if you said, look, Trello doesn't like you,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.260]   you've been banned for life,
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.340]   Cal Newport can't use Trello anymore.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.740]   I could come up with an alternative
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.840]   that solves the basic problems.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.540]   It would be a little bit slower, a little bit clunkier,
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.300]   but again, a little bit slower, a little bit clunkier,
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.200]   doesn't matter.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.380]   What really matters is capture matters
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.140]   so I don't have to think about something,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.020]   a place that has relevant information matters,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.700]   and then beyond that is all these little details
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.460]   of little efficiencies, they don't add up that much.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.420]   'Cause in the end, the thing that's on that Trello card
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.380]   you have to do is gonna take you hours.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.740]   And whether you had it in a nice Trello card
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.040]   or you're using bullet points in a Google Doc,
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.500]   it's still a thing that's gonna take you three hours.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.060]   And so it took two minutes over here
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.260]   versus one minute over here
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.420]   because of some sort of integration
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:50.420]   gets just overwhelmed by the time to actually do the task.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.980]   I mean, I like the tools, don't get me wrong.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.980]   I mean, I like when things are fast and they're just nice,
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.820]   it's pleasing.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.280]   It's like keeping your car really clean,
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.900]   but it doesn't really matter
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.780]   in terms of how long it takes you to get to work.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.620]   - Yeah.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:09.020]   - I say that because we just detailed our minivan.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.000]   Six hours.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.220]   - Wait, you did it?
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.180]   - Well, we hired someone.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.020]   - Yeah.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.220]   - Six hours, yeah.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.740]   He retired from the industry
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.180]   and found religion after that job.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.340]   He was like, here's what he said.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.180]   And I'm quoting him.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.660]   This actually, we have a very dirty minivan
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.860]   'cause we have a lot of kids and they're not very neat.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.180]   And he emerged from the minivan six hours later.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.320]   And all he said was, "There is no God."
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.180]   And then he dropped his tools and joined a monastery.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.020]   So I don't know.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.180]   It doesn't speak well for the cleanliness of our car.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.500]   That's what he said, there is no God.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.140]   And joined a monastery.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.780]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.020]   What do we got next?
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.780]   - All right, next question's from Damair from Nigeria.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.260]   How do top writers like you
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.820]   ensure your research process is efficient?
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.860]   Put another way, how do you avoid over-researching?
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.100]   Research is seductive.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.940]   And I, for one, often find myself sucked helplessly
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.340]   into research rabbit holes.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.740]   - Well, I don't know if efficient is the right word here.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.980]   I would say professional writers
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.580]   don't particularly care about the efficiency
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.700]   of their research habits.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.660]   Some of the most lauded nonfiction writers, for example,
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.780]   use what are probably very slow habits
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.540]   in terms of manually looking through papers and archives
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.900]   and taking notes by hand.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.940]   They don't really focus on,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:36.500]   I wanna really quickly process this information necessarily.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.940]   Because again, that's not the bottleneck
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.380]   for producing the good writing.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.700]   The hard part is synthesizing the information
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.940]   and actually doing the work of writing.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.780]   So they wouldn't use the word efficient.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.260]   There is, however, as you're rightly pointing out here,
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.260]   the termination problem.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.060]   When do you shift from research,
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.460]   whether you're in the moment being efficient
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.220]   or being Robert Caro, turn every page style inefficient,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:06.220]   how do you shift at some point from researching into writing?
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.900]   Typically, what professional writers have to help them here
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.540]   is professional necessity.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.180]   This article needs to come out.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.740]   I don't know how much patience my editor is gonna have
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.500]   if I take another few months.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.100]   Or if you're a book writer, this advances run out.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.540]   I don't know how much longer we can pay the water bill
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.580]   if I don't actually get this book done,
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.020]   I do need to start writing.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   So I think the big differentiator with that issue
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.980]   between professional and non-professional writers
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.620]   is the professional writers have strong incentives
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.180]   to not take too long.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.780]   Now, the other incentive is I wanna write something good
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.940]   because otherwise this magazine will stop hiring more,
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.140]   people will stop buying my book.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.740]   So then they have this, I think, very healthy tension.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.220]   I need enough research for this to be good,
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.460]   but I can't do research forever
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.020]   because I need to put this thing out.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.620]   And those things work together and that often works out,
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.860]   it's not perfect, but that often works out
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.740]   to provide a pretty good balance
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.420]   between those two incentives.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.420]   And what happens over time
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.100]   is professional writers develop a gut.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.420]   I know I have it, I just, I've written enough things
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.100]   that I know I have what I need now,
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.140]   I'm imagining the article as I go along,
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.100]   I have what I need to get into it.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.820]   And then I can go back and fill in the gaps later,
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.900]   there'll be some places the writing will reveal
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.460]   I need a better source here or there.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.020]   You just, you do it enough time
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.980]   that feedback helps develop a gut.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.860]   And then after a while you dive into your research,
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.340]   you're either efficient or inefficient, doesn't matter.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.380]   You have a pretty good signal at a pretty reasonable time,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.420]   let's shift from this over into writing.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.860]   So it's a problem you have if you're not in that situation,
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.820]   if you're writing, let's say,
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.100]   as an independent or autonomous project,
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:49.660]   you in some sense have to simulate that back pressure.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.900]   You have to simulate this needs to be good,
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.340]   but I can't take too long on it.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.460]   And the best ways to do that
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.900]   is to have some sort of deadline.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.660]   It could be arbitrary.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.740]   Some people who have a brand of self-discipline
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.140]   that means if they set a deadline for themselves,
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.260]   they'll actually obey that
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.940]   and feel really bad about missing it.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.660]   Other people need to get others involved.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.700]   I promise you this draft of my thesis
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.180]   by the end of this month,
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.780]   and you do the best you can within those constraints.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.700]   This is why I often say,
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.860]   if you're trying to become a writer,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.380]   find ways to take on commissions for money for an editor,
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.900]   even if the money is $50
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.500]   and if the editor is probably gonna accept it,
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.900]   you want this type of back pressure because it is useful.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.300]   And in this case, it's gonna help you,
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.100]   A, push your research to be good,
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.260]   but B, not take too long
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.700]   because you have these competing forces.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.660]   So the demo there, that's what I'd suggest
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.860]   is you need to create that tension in your life,
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.540]   that dual-headed tension.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.140]   This thing needs to be good, but I can't take too long.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.220]   And when you try to serve both of those constraints,
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.380]   you end up finding over time a bit of a sweet spot
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.900]   and you hit that sweet spot enough times,
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.060]   you develop a gut,
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.740]   and then it's not so hard in the future
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.700]   because in the future, you just know,
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.460]   yeah, this is enough to start writing.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.780]   Let's rock and roll on it.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.540]   - Research.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.460]   Yeah, writers are often very old-fashioned
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.780]   in their techniques.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.020]   Some are like high-tech, but I don't know,
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.620]   they're so focused on just the craft of writing
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.780]   that it's like little things make a difference.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.460]   I want a good place to store my notes,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.820]   but I mean, they have systems,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.700]   but the systems I'm saying are often not these things
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.460]   that you would put on a productivity YouTube.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.700]   It's like rubber band these index cards together.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.540]   I have these Xerox papers.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.820]   I mean, the best is I don't wanna give away too much of this
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.900]   'cause I go into detail of this
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.020]   in the "Slow Productivity" book that's coming out in March,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.780]   but I really get into John McPhee's habits.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.420]   He has systems that are very specific,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.340]   but they are very inefficient.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.380]   He's typing things and cutting them out with scissors
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.500]   and arranging them on plywood, and it's like slow,
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.340]   but it doesn't matter
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.180]   'cause he's writing a 30,000-word article,
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.620]   and no matter how slow you make that process
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.900]   of how he deals with information,
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.020]   it's gonna be swamped by the time required
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.860]   to actually write the article, so it doesn't really matter.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.260]   He just needs something that works for him
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.580]   just to sort of structure his efforts.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.300]   So writers have systems for sure,
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.980]   but they are not automated.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.740]   My computer is automatically,
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.100]   my smart house sensor talks to my computer
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.340]   when I walk through the door,
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.660]   so the computer can activate
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.380]   and automatically pull the latest drafts
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.180]   out of my various Dropbox folders,
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.780]   and then a Zapier script takes that
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.740]   and produces a text-to-audio summary of my last notes
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.180]   that can play in the speaker
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.260]   that follows me through the house until I sit down.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.780]   No, no, no, it's more like I have this burlap sack
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.740]   in which I keep the copies of my manuscript,
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.120]   and I always bring this burlap sack with me
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.860]   to the same stool at the bar
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.620]   where I drink a pint of Hefeweizen
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.100]   before I start using napkin.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.180]   The writers have systems, but they're not high-tech.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.980]   - So did you talk to McPhee?
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.540]   - I did not talk to McPhee, no.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:01.100]   I talked to one of his editors, though,
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.820]   one of his book editors who has an affiliation
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.600]   with Georgetown, and we had a good conversation.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.180]   He's still around.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.220]   He's like 87, 89.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.580]   He's not a young man.
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.500]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.220]   A great writer.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.460]   All right, let's do one more question here.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.980]   - All right, researcher at heart,
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.380]   a 31-year-old professor.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.200]   I'm an assistant professor of psychology
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.700]   on a tenure-track position.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.780]   I hate everything about teaching.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.340]   I hate that I am inexperienced.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.960]   I hate the lack of help and resources
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.980]   to do it better and more efficiently.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.020]   I hate how exhausted it makes me,
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.460]   how it can take my whole day with the preparation,
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.140]   stress, replying to student emails.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.580]   How would you approach this problem?
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.860]   - Well, my first advice,
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.900]   do not open, when you go up for promotion,
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.180]   do not open your teaching statement with that paragraph.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.220]   That'd be advice number one.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.260]   That would be the world's worst teaching statement
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.340]   in your promotion package.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.500]   I hate teaching.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.260]   I hate everything about it.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.380]   That's my first piece of advice.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.340]   Don't put that in there.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.300]   All right, let's step back here a little bit.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.780]   I think partially,
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.660]   and this is gonna sound weird at first, I'll explain.
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.460]   You're thinking about this too much.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.580]   You're self-analyzing and self-reflecting
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.380]   and focusing on what you don't like
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.520]   and what's not going right
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.020]   and my recommendations aren't where they are
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.340]   and how much time is this taking
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.100]   and you're spiraling here.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.860]   Teaching is, some people enjoy it more than others.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.300]   Depending on the subject for some people,
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.300]   it can be a bigger footprint than others.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.240]   It should not dominate your mind this much.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.460]   So here's what I'm gonna suggest.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.900]   I'm gonna suggest what we're gonna do
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.540]   is a fixed schedule productivity approach here.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.900]   You're gonna figure out what is a reasonable amount of time
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.460]   to spend on courses given my particular academic position
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.820]   and trajectory, right?
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.660]   How much is it two days a week,
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.340]   most of that day is a three hours a day.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.860]   You're gonna figure out a reasonable time schedule.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.600]   And then what we're gonna do is work backwards
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.860]   from those constraints and say,
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.780]   what's the best possible teaching I can do
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.660]   within those constraints?
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.740]   We'll elaborate that in a second.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.900]   And then third,
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.820]   you're gonna not think about that much beyond it.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.740]   It'll do what it'll do.
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:15.740]   And you know what that's gonna be?
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.460]   It'll be better than you think.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.500]   And over time, the ratings will get even better
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.300]   from your students as you just become more used to it.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.860]   It's not gonna be as bad as you think,
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.380]   putting time constraints on the teaching
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.300]   because it's gonna push innovation and your processes
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.980]   and reduction of pain points and adding efficiencies.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.940]   And it'll be fine.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.640]   And you will get fine ratings
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.060]   and they'll probably go up over time.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.740]   And maybe you're not gonna get high ratings and that's fine.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.840]   But that's just what you should do.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.900]   And I don't want you to think about it much more beyond that.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.920]   You've given that part of your life what you should give it.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.540]   And it doesn't really require much more thought than that.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.060]   Again, here's the thing about research track professoredom.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.540]   You can't get tenure for being a good teacher.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.820]   You can lose tenure if you're negligent.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.300]   You can at a research institution,
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.380]   if you're a negligent teacher,
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.860]   you can lose tenure if you're a terrible teacher.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.860]   But otherwise it's a bit of a no op
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.720]   for the tenure case that you'll eventually come up.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.940]   So I don't want you wasting so much energy on it.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.260]   All right, so let's go now
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.820]   and elaborate these steps a little bit more.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.700]   Fix your time constraint that you think is reasonable.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.080]   This will allow me to put a lot of time into this,
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.880]   but give me a lot of time left over for research
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.960]   and my other obligations.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.880]   Two, say what's the best I can do within that constraints.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.720]   And here's where all of the actual
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.720]   in the weeds innovation is going to happen.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.000]   You need to look for pain points
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.700]   and see if there's ways to eliminate those
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.680]   without really affecting the student experience.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.600]   I think a relevant example here was me talking
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.340]   in the deep dive earlier about my TA experience
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.680]   in grad school, right?
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.260]   Overhauled how students submit problem sets
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.020]   in a way that barely changed anything for them,
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.780]   but eliminated a major pain point for me.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.380]   Think through how you can be doing that
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.380]   on many other different aspects of teaching.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.980]   You mentioned in your longer response, for example,
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.140]   about how like you're always dealing
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.180]   with student emails all day.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.940]   There's ways to deal with this, to constrain that more.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.540]   We're adding more office hours,
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.660]   but moving more communication to the office hours
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.980]   by having more structured
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.220]   for the things they're writing about.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.420]   There's more structured systems
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.220]   for how they talk about a grade request or this or that.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.040]   There's things to do here,
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.140]   as opposed to just saying, this is just overwhelming
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.860]   and they always want me in and what can I do with it?
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.420]   There's pain points here that can be reduced
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.260]   and the students won't even notice it, right?
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.460]   I mean, again, typically what students want
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.700]   is clarity and fairness.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.080]   And I know how this course functions.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.660]   I know how I talk to the professor.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.960]   I know how the grading works.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.660]   And it's consistent and it's fair.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.260]   That's what they care about.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.060]   Not so much, why can't I have full accessibility?
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.500]   Why this system seems harder
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.700]   than me just emailing a professor.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.580]   They don't care so much about that,
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.300]   but they do want clarity and they do want fairness.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.340]   So look for the pain points to eliminate.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.740]   Get better processes for, okay, how do I prep lectures now?
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.220]   And I don't want this to be good,
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.180]   but I don't wanna spend too much time.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.400]   Let me rethink the way I do problem sets or evaluation.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.660]   So I'm not just up to my ears and grading all the time.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.060]   Maybe there's an alternative way to do this
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.340]   that's gonna be more straightforward,
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.520]   but it's gonna, for me,
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.960]   without really affecting the student experience,
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.240]   I'm gonna figure out what type of lecture format works best.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.500]   I'm struggling with trying to get the class to interact.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.120]   So we're gonna do something different with it.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.440]   I can find something that works well enough
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.600]   so I don't have to think about it again.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.640]   Again, there is a huge amount of innovation here
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.720]   and it all comes backwards to,
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.540]   here's my fixed amount of time I can spend on this.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.880]   I wanna do the best I can.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.580]   And then I will accept whatever results that produces.
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:37.000]   I can tell you from experience,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.440]   it's gonna produce better results than you think.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.040]   And two, it doesn't matter if it makes you
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.400]   into Robin Williams from Dead Poets Society or not.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.020]   I don't want you thinking about it too much more beyond that.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.120]   It's I've handled this,
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.860]   I'm giving this a good amount of time.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.580]   I've got rid of pain points that don't need to be there.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.180]   I've changed around things to better suit my strengths.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.460]   And then I'm a whatever,
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.340]   middle of the road rated professor.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.840]   Let's move on and think about other things.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.680]   And if that doesn't work,
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.380]   you could do the Dead Poets Society thing.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.220]   That might also work.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.660]   Just stand on your desk a lot.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.060]   Make your students stand on your desk.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.780]   I do that in my discrete mathematics course.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.020]   So stand on your desk.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.140]   And I play emotional music.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.820]   It gets a little weird after a few weeks of doing that.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.100]   But I stand on your desk and play emotional music.
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.660]   Like, "Captain, my captain,
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.420]   what is the expectation of this guy
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.780]   if we replace the six with another three?"
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.500]   No, well, actually, I realized, bless you,
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.900]   we have one more question lurking here.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.140]   I just missed it.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:36.980]   So let's do one more.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:37.800]   We got time.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.100]   - Sounds good.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.540]   All right, this question's from Danny,
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.540]   a postdoc from Texas.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.060]   I'm currently a postdoc.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.580]   I have heard many times from multiple people,
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.380]   if you ain't busy or looking tired,
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.200]   you're not doing it right.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.940]   I do not feel busy or tired.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.560]   As a matter of fact, I really enjoy being a postdoc.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.700]   I've been implementing and following your theories
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.140]   for a couple of years now, which has helped.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.580]   But as someone who is striving to get into academia
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.540]   for teaching and research purposes,
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.660]   I am nervous if I am going into a field
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.380]   where if I'm not perceived by people
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.820]   as being overwhelmed or drowning.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.260]   - Yeah, this is common.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.900]   This is common in academia, because here's the thing.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.140]   It's a weird job to be a grad student, a postdoc,
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.140]   or an assistant professor,
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.820]   but especially a postdoc or a grad student.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.300]   It's a weird job because it, unlike other jobs,
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.300]   doesn't have this diverse input of tasks and obligations
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.700]   you need to be working on all day long.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.820]   Your friends went to investment banks
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.540]   and they are working 10 hours a day
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.380]   and they have spreadsheets they have to fill out
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.500]   and emails they have to answer
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.600]   and meetings they have to go to
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.780]   and decks they have to update.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.660]   They always have, that feels like work.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.940]   And then you're a postdoc or a grad student
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.100]   and it's your advisor's like, write a paper,
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.900]   I'll see you at Christmas, and it doesn't feel like work.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.060]   And so there's a tendency that people get worried,
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.080]   they get anxious about this,
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.720]   and they want to invent busyness.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.820]   They want to invent the same type of overload
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:08.020]   that they hear their friends at real jobs talking about,
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.820]   'cause at least they can tell themselves, I'm not lazy,
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.780]   I'm working hard, I'm busy all the time.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.340]   So if this doesn't go well,
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.340]   it's not gonna be because I just wasn't doing the work.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.860]   I think expansiveness and autonomy and schedules
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.800]   can be very uncomfortable for people
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.460]   if they're not used to it.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.460]   And so you get a lot of grad students and postdocs
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.820]   who try to lean into finding pain points of business.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.860]   But here's the reality is that it's actually,
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.360]   with some exceptions, exceptions that typically involve
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.160]   lab work is very time consuming, these are easy jobs.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.480]   And I think it's okay.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.160]   I love being a grad student, I love being a postdoc.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.560]   They're not super demanding jobs.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.440]   As you become a professor, it gets more demanding
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.240]   because there's other types of responsibilities
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.080]   that are layered on,
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.380]   and then it becomes much harder to juggle.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.820]   That's okay.
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.480]   They're not paying you that much money.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.280]   So it's okay that it's not,
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.600]   I need to do nine hours a day of busy work.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.500]   You are completely safe to sidestep that culture
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.840]   of my hair is on fire, dissertation hell.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.600]   Everything is so hard, what a hard job.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.620]   I'm so overloaded, I'm so busy.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.500]   It's okay to say I'm working on one research paper
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.320]   and I give it three good hours a day.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.580]   And then I'm training for a marathon
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.420]   because I don't really have a lot to do
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.260]   on a lot of other days.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.100]   That's okay.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.740]   That is a perfectly reasonable schedule for a postdoc.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:28.900]   What was I doing?
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.100]   When I was a postdoc,
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.260]   I injected a lot of non-postdoc related things
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.400]   into my life because A, it didn't take that much time,
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.260]   and B, I knew as a professor,
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.700]   I was gonna have a lot of other things to do.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.500]   So I wanted to get used to fitting the stuff
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.140]   I was doing as a postdoc to research,
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.220]   which I would still have to do as a professor.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.740]   I was like, I wanna be really comfortable doing that
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.660]   in a relatively small amount of time
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.160]   because even though I could, as a postdoc,
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.960]   take the papers I'm working on
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.260]   and find a way to take up my whole day with it,
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.220]   I can't do that as a professor
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.540]   because I'm gonna have classes to teach
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.460]   and service obligations and family.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.100]   They're gonna have way more distractions.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.280]   So I better get good now at doing just this thing
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.700]   that I'm tasked to do as a postdoc research,
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.060]   doing this in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.900]   And so I did a lot of other things.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:12.880]   I wrote a book.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.460]   I was sculling.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.740]   I was taking sculling classes on the Charles through BU.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.920]   I would go for a long midday run and exercise.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.860]   I'd run home across the Charles on the Mass Ave Bridge
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.780]   and then would exercise on one of the floating docks
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.980]   and would get lunch and watch a show
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.020]   and then take the subway back from Charles MGH to MIT
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.940]   and do a little bit more work in the afternoon.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.860]   I mean, I had huge breaks out of my day
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.900]   and that was all designed.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   I was like, I cannot let myself get into the mindset
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.340]   of this work needs to take up the whole day
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.600]   because everything's gonna get
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.380]   for real busier in the future.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.860]   And so if I make this fake busy,
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.620]   how am I gonna handle that in the future?
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.040]   So this is all to say,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.700]   you can ignore that culture of busyness.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.140]   If you have good organizational systems,
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.460]   it sounds like you do, you listen to my stuff
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.380]   and you don't have a really hard lab position
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.920]   where you're overseeing seven grad students
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.540]   and a bunch of undergraduates as part of a giant NIH grant.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.780]   If you don't have one of those situations,
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.620]   just lean into it.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.940]   Like this is a pretty easy job and that's great
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.540]   'cause life will get harder soon enough
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.940]   and you can be fine with it.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.660]   And as for the question of whether that's gonna hurt
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.860]   your academic trajectory, no one cares or notices
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.340]   how you feel or how quickly you answer emails
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.740]   or how busy you are.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.600]   All that matters for that is what did you publish?
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.440]   How good was it?
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.640]   How many people cited it?
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.380]   That is all that matters.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.600]   Some of the most famous academics in histories
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.020]   were basically misanthropes and did nothing,
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.340]   were pains, were lazy, were irresponsible.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.780]   It didn't matter.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.100]   Papers are all that matters.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.240]   So just focus on doing your research well.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.800]   No one is gonna say, we wanted to accept you
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.180]   and we love your work and we love your papers,
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.140]   but we heard that like you often don't work past five
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.700]   or whatever, no one cares.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.740]   Let's care about your papers.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.580]   So lean into it.
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:56.420]   Postdocs a great job.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.020]   It's a fake job, an awesome job.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.600]   I miss it.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.940]   You're okay not being busy.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.740]   Those really are easy jobs.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:06.860]   And they're not easy jobs, but they're hard
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.460]   because of the autonomy, honestly.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.140]   I really do think it breaks a lot of people.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.860]   They're like, especially at the elite school,
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.500]   you go to a school like MIT or something,
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:18.060]   it's just write some papers, let me know how I can help.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.180]   It really is.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.960]   I'll check back in at the end of the semester.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.140]   And that can drown you or it could be super exciting.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   And some people are like, this is great.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.300]   I'm like writing papers and have all these hobbies
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.140]   and whatever.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.780]   And some people just have to find a way
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.040]   for this to be hard and for me to be busy.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.980]   And it's really clear.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:40.820]   It's like binary.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.660]   You're either one or you're the other.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.620]   - Yeah, it's a good job.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:45.980]   The easiest jobs I ever had.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.380]   - People always think I'm crazy when I say
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.020]   I wrote a book during my dissertation
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.400]   because writing my dissertation did not take enough time.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.920]   I was like, well, how long can I spend on this?
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.200]   Like, what am I gonna do?
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.440]   It was like two hours a day.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.180]   So let me write a book at the same time, unrelated.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:04.320]   Grad students love to hear that from me.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.040]   Write a book while you do your dissertation.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.400]   All right, I wanna move on and close up the show
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.600]   with something interesting.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.360]   Before I do though, let me just briefly mention
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.540]   our friends at Blinkist.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.860]   The Blinkist app enables you to understand
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:22.960]   the most important things from over 5,500 nonfiction books
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.180]   and podcasts in short summaries that you can read
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:31.180]   or listen to that require only 15 minutes of your time.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.360]   So if there's a book you're thinking you might wanna read,
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.920]   but you're not sure, you get the summary from Blinkist.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.000]   They call them Blinks.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:39.900]   You can listen to it.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.500]   It takes about 15 minutes so you can read it on your phone,
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.180]   learn the main ideas of the book and decide,
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.880]   do I wanna buy this or not?
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   Use this as your main tool for triaging your reading life
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.940]   and it will make a big difference.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.320]   It will prevent you from buying books you don't need to buy.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.540]   It'll point you towards books that are very meaningful,
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.140]   end up being very impactful for you.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.740]   And it will, in general, let you have the lay of the land
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.220]   of these topics because these summaries
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.780]   are giving you the big points.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.660]   So even if you listen to the Blinks of five books
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.740]   on a topic and only buy one,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.580]   you're still getting the major points
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.140]   out of all five of those books.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.080]   And so you're gonna come away
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.340]   with a pretty expansive knowledge of these areas.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:25.220]   So I like to think about Blinkist as a critical sidekick
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:29.520]   for anyone who embraces the reading life.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.940]   Both Jesse and I use it in this way.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.900]   We both triage reading lists using our Blinkist accounts.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.720]   Yeah, I don't know if you use collections at all.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.420]   - But I haven't yet, no.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.160]   - I mean, it's an obvious idea.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.940]   I'm glad they did it.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.720]   Some of these are curated by writer friends of mine,
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.540]   like people we know, like Adam Grant has one, for example.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.260]   And they'll curate a list of here's 10 books
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.980]   on a topic that I think are really good.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:53.140]   That's kind of cool because if you're looking
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.900]   for new things to read, you say, great,
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.100]   I'll just work my way through the Blinks
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.780]   of this curated collection.
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.340]   And probably, I don't know, two or three
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:04.260]   out of the 10 books will really remain
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.980]   and catch your attention after you listen to the Blinks.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.900]   But those are two or three books
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.060]   you never would have thought to read.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.420]   And you get all the information
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.820]   from the Blinks of the books you don't read.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.220]   So I like that they do that as well.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.900]   So not only does it help you triage the books
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.140]   you already are thinking about reading or not,
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.860]   it can point you towards books
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.340]   you might not already know about.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.780]   They also have a cool new feature right now
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.980]   called Blinkist Connect, which is a two
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.820]   for the price is one type of offer.
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.780]   It allows you to share titles with other people.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.300]   So you're sharing your premium account with another person.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.660]   So it's essentially like you have two premium subscriptions
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.500]   for the price of one.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.600]   So if there's a reader in your life
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.540]   who you think might benefit from Blinkist,
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:46.380]   this Blinkist Connect will allow you to share that gift.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:49.020]   So right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.980]   just for our audience.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.780]   Go to blinkist.com/deep to start your seven-day free trial
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.720]   and get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.460]   That's Blinkist, spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:04.900]   blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off any seven-day free trial,
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.140]   blinkist.com/deep.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.460]   And don't forget that for a limited time,
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.460]   you can use Blinkist Connect to share that premium account.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.940]   You'll get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.660]   I also wanna talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:24.660]   You need a VPN and ExpressVPN is the one I recommend.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.900]   Why do you need a VPN?
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.740]   Well, here's the thing.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.700]   When you use the internet,
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.720]   people can watch what you're doing.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.540]   If you're connecting to a wireless access point,
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.580]   anyone nearby can actually read those packets
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580]   off the radio waves.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.240]   And even if the contents of the packets are protected,
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.060]   they can see the destination of those packets.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.580]   That's not protected.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.980]   So they can say, hey, this guy over here,
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.460]   this Jesse is, you know,
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.120]   he's going to blinkist.com right now.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.020]   I can tell who he's talking to, right?
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.160]   So they know who you're talking to.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.460]   Your internet service provider.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.620]   So even when you're at home,
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.220]   directly wired into your internet service provider,
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.860]   they can watch who you're talking to
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.980]   and they can sell that data,
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.700]   which a lot of internet service providers do.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.940]   Hey, here's the type of websites
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.100]   that this customer of mine goes to.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.420]   Let's choose ads to show them.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.820]   The VPN stops people from doing that.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.660]   Here's how it works.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.820]   Instead of talking directly to blinkist.com,
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.640]   if you use a VPN, you would instead send an encrypted request
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.940]   to a VPN server and say, hey,
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.580]   I wanna talk to blinkist.com.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.380]   And then that server talks to the website
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.820]   or service on your behalf,
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.840]   gets the response, encrypts it and sends it back to you.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.740]   So what does the people sniffing the packets
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.740]   out of the air see?
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.980]   What does your internet service provider see?
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.820]   Just that you're talking to a VPN server.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.320]   And they will say, and they will shake their fist
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.420]   demonstrably as they do so,
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.020]   foiled,
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.020]   foiled by this VPN I say.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.560]   This is exactly how people talk,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.860]   who sniff packets or work at ISPs.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.680]   So it's a way to actually get back privacy
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.520]   in what you're doing.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.660]   Most people don't even realize
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.580]   their privacy is being violated this way.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.180]   VPNs pull you back.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.080]   If you're gonna use VPN,
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.780]   I would suggest the one that's rated number one
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.380]   by CNET and TechRadar,
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.300]   and that is ExpressVPN.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.140]   The software is very easy.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.260]   It works with the other,
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.620]   any app you already use to access the internet
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.780]   on any of your devices,
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:14.740]   just click a button, turn on the VPN.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.020]   Now you're protected.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.180]   Everything else just works the way it normally would.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.660]   They have servers all around the world.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.940]   So you're almost certainly not gonna be far
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.620]   from a nearby server to connect to.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.180]   And remember, close is good because close is fast.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.440]   They also have a lot of good bandwidth to use connections.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.580]   So you need a VPN,
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.840]   and I would recommend using ExpressVPN.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.320]   So protect your online privacy
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.660]   by visiting expressvpn.com/deep today.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.560]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/deep.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.360]   Don't forget to use that /deep
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.160]   because that will give you an extra three months free.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   Expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.480]   All right, Jessie, that brings us to our final segment
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.120]   of the day, which is something interesting.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.100]   It's where I like to highlight something interesting
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.540]   that you, my listeners, have sent
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:07.220]   to my interesting@calnewport.com email address.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.420]   Now, before we get to today's thing I wanted to highlight,
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.820]   there's something I wanted to mention briefly
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.180]   from a friend of mine.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.120]   It's a friend of mine from the productivity world
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.120]   that goes way back to the early Web 2.0,
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.980]   early 2000s days when I first started getting involved
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.980]   in writing about these things.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.740]   It's my friend, Mike Vardy, who I've known forever.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.520]   He's one of the OG online productivity thinkers.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.760]   Anyways, I just wanted to mention
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.240]   that he has a Kickstarter going for a new book of his.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.040]   So he's experimenting
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.280]   with the direct-to-consumer book model.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.920]   I'll bring this up on the screen here,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.040]   but if you're watching, and if you are watching,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.440]   by the way, I should say this is episode 251.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.120]   So go to youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.400]   or thedeeplife.com and look for episode 251
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.600]   if you wanna watch what I'm showing you
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.840]   on the screen right now or the entire episode as a whole.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.180]   But anyways, he has this new project he's working on
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.620]   called "The Productivity Diet."
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.600]   You get it directly through Kickstarter.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.360]   He's already met his goal,
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.140]   so you will for sure get the book if you pledge.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.060]   Anyways, check it out.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.920]   The link is in the show notes.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.880]   There's a good video where Mike explains his philosophy,
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.840]   but he's one of the original guys who thinks
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.700]   about in-the-weeds practical productivity
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.800]   in a way that makes your life sustainable.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.120]   Check it out.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.240]   Anyways, let's get now to the actual thing
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.020]   that someone sent me that I wanted to highlight,
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.780]   which was a link for this hotel,
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.760]   which I'm loading up on the screen now if you're watching.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.520]   It's called the Sylvia Beach Hotel.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.520]   This is in Newport Beach, or no, Newport, Oregon,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.300]   not Newport Beach, the beach in Newport, Oregon,
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:50.240]   named after me, so I feel like I do need to be here.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.400]   And it is a hotel that is quote unquote
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.320]   truly for book lovers, and I thought this was cool.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.560]   So here's the idea with this hotel.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.720]   It overlooks the ocean.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.400]   There are no telephones, TVs, or Wi-Fi
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.980]   in rooms at Sylvia Beach Hotel.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.680]   The allure is beach quiet, gathering one's thoughts,
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.200]   writing, reading, and savoring the wonder of ocean and sky.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.700]   So their idea here is you come here
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.600]   to think and not be distracted.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.060]   They are in particular focused on writers.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.480]   How do you know this?
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   The rooms, each room is themed to a particular writer.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.920]   I'll show you a couple of examples here in a second.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.560]   They also have a great third floor oceanfront library.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.980]   Jesse, we got a book tickets here.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.860]   You go to the library, you just read books,
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.200]   you look at the ocean, you have author-themed rooms.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.440]   I'll show a couple on the screen here
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.960]   for those who are watching.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.080]   No Cal Newport room yet, but I am hopeful.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.540]   Look, here's a John Steinbeck room.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.820]   So if we load up the picture of the John Steinbeck room,
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.820]   you see there is a "Of Mice and Men," "Grapes of Wrath" style
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.300]   1920s car packed with all sorts of gear on it
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.580]   that's built into the wall.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.100]   The headlights are actually lamps
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.040]   and there's a cool writing table there.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.940]   There's another one I saw.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:15.900]   Here's a J.K. Rowling room.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.800]   So it looks like you're in a Hogwarts type situation,
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.960]   I suppose.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.160]   So we see there, there's an owl, there's Hedwig.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.120]   Anyways, I thought that was cool.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:32.120]   And I like this idea of a location you go just to think,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.780]   it has no distractions, but also the staging of it
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.340]   just puts you in the mindset of authors,
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.860]   puts you in the mindset of reading.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.920]   So I'm showing this for two reasons.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.300]   One, 'cause I wanna go.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.840]   So maybe they'll hook me up, revisit the Newport,
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.320]   Newport heads to Newport, Oregon,
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.240]   and I can be in the J.K. Rowling suite
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.560]   and look over the ocean and be fantastic.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.160]   But two, I think this is underscoring
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.920]   a more generalized principle,
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.500]   which I talk a lot about on the show,
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:05.080]   which is setting matters when it comes to producing
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.480]   original, creative, or valuable deep thought.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.160]   Setting can put you into a better mindset.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.600]   It makes it more conducive for the cogitation that you seek.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.400]   So even if you're not going to this particular hotel
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.540]   on the Oregon coast, this general idea
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:23.000]   of going a bit over the top to signal to yourself
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.480]   and your brain, I take this thinking seriously,
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.500]   to help give yourself the right cues to think properly
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.380]   does make a difference.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.240]   Yes, you have already a drab home office
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.800]   set up technically at your house,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.000]   but you could still take that garden shed
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.400]   and convert it into a writing room.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.180]   And you might decorate it Steinbeck style
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.080]   and wow, this seems so weird and over the top
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.800]   and stupid and superfluous, but it's not
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.040]   because what you're doing is just trying to set up
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   the conditions that are going to maximize
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.680]   your brain's ability to slip into
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.580]   and produce the best possible thoughts.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.280]   So I'm increasingly a fan of leveraging setting
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.320]   as a critical component of deep thinking.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.320]   So this hotel clarifies and purifies that general idea.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.000]   We all could perhaps have a touch of that book lover hotel
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.560]   in our day-to-day professional lives,
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.360]   but the message there is general.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   I don't know, Jesse, I don't know what would be
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.680]   in a Cal Newport room at this hotel.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.920]   - Some bookshelves for sure.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.360]   - Yeah, I guess it'd be, I don't know what'd be in there.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.440]   Yeah, some books.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   - One of the machines you have in the other room.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.480]   - Some sort of weird machine, a computer with a keyboard
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.680]   that doesn't work, I think would somehow.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.240]   - Are your, what's the machine called in the other room?
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.080]   - 3D printer.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:38.900]   - Yeah, your 3D printer.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.320]   - Yeah, okay, we have a 3D printer,
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.960]   a keyboard that doesn't work.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.760]   I think it could be nerve wracking.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.600]   Like what if-
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.420]   - Time block planner.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.260]   - Time block planner.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.680]   - A rower.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.840]   - The rowing machine would be in there somehow.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.120]   Yeah, I don't know how popular this room's gonna be, Jesse.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.520]   This doesn't sound conducive to deep thought.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.440]   That'd be the worst if this hotel was,
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.880]   hey, we have a room dedicated to you
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.080]   and we want you to come out for the dedication.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.100]   You're all excited and you get there
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.760]   and it's just really distasteful.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.280]   It really could be a sort of look in the mirror
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.200]   type moment or something like that.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.960]   You're like, okay, you get there
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.880]   and it's full of German pornography or something like that.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.920]   You're like, I don't know if I'm coming across the way.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.480]   I'm not sure if I'm coming across the way I think I am.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.360]   The dismembered mannequins,
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.000]   just like a pile of dismembered mannequins in the room
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.720]   and a wall full of German pornography.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.840]   Hey, it's the Cal Newport room.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.080]   Like we're really pushing this.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.560]   Like, I don't know if the world sees me
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.520]   the same way I see me.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.800]   I'm not sure about this.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.720]   It might be a mixed blessing.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.120]   Why is there a rowing machine in here?
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.080]   I don't know about this.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.640]   Oh well, we can all dream about
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.480]   going on vacations like that.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.520]   Anyways, let's wrap this up.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.960]   Thank you everyone for listening or watching.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.800]   I hope you enjoyed the show.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.400]   We'll be back next week with a new episode
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.860]   and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.020]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.540]   (upbeat music)
