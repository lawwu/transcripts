[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.880]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, and reading again from verse 40 to
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:22.080]   verse 45. One of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.320]   brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.800]   Messiah, which is being interpreted the Christ, and he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.040]   beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   is by interpretation a stone of Peter. The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.320]   and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.920]   whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.440]   Now those who worship here regularly will appreciate at once what I am doing when I
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.480]   read those verses to you for our consideration this morning.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.680]   We began last Sunday morning with a study of the section of this first chapter of the
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.040]   gospel according to St. John, which begins at verse 35 and goes on to the end of the
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.760]   chapter. And I was suggesting last Sunday that what we have in this section, from verse
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.520]   35 to the end, is a series of illustrations provided for us by the evangelists, but still
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.920]   more by the grace of God, illustrations of how it is that one ever attains unto what
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.080]   is offered us in the gospel, the thing mentioned in verse 16, of his fullness, of all we receive,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.360]   and grace upon grace. Or I suggested we could look at it like this. John the Baptist, in
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.240]   his testimony to our Lord, emphasized this great fact, that the characteristic of our
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.120]   Lord's ministry would be that he would baptize people with the Holy Ghost.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.880]   Now, says John, I indeed baptize you with water. That's all right, but that's only
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:53.240]   preliminary. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. And this, I am suggesting and
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.680]   have been suggesting for many months, is the thing on which all Christian people should
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.760]   keep their eye. It is only as we are baptized with the Holy Ghost that we really know anything
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.720]   about this fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and are enabled to be witnesses unto him.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.520]   Well now, that was great and exalted doctrine. There is nothing higher. I venture to suggest
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.720]   that there is nothing in this world beyond the experience accompanying the baptism with
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.920]   the Holy Spirit. It is a foretest of heaven. As Isaac Watts puts it in that hymn we have
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:43.320]   just been singing, "The celestial fruits are to be tasted even here on earthly ground.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.760]   The men of grace have found glory begun below." And that is the result of the baptism with
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   the Spirit.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.800]   Well now, it does seem to me that what we have here in this section that we are looking
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.440]   at is something like this. When you read the New Testament description of the Christian
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   men, when you read some of the lives and biographies of some of the great saints throughout the
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.720]   centuries, perhaps your first reaction will be to feel, "Well, that is very wonderful,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.760]   but it is not for me. It is not possible. It is too exalted." Many have thought that.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.800]   Many have been so convinced of that that they felt the only thing to do was to retire out
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.160]   of the world. They said, "You cannot be in business and get that experience. You cannot
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.720]   be an ordinary person at all and get that experience. You have obviously got to segregate
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.360]   yourself. You must go out from the world into some kind of wilderness and become a monk
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.280]   or a hermit or an anchorite. And there you give the whole of your time to prayer and
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   meditation in seeking God's face."
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.840]   No, it is the position of all of us who are Protestants to say that that is a complete
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.560]   fallacy and is indeed in many ways a denial of the central glory of the Christian message.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:16.520]   It is unnecessary. The glory is that in the midst of life we can have such experiences
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   and know in that way of His fullness.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.200]   And I believe that this section is particularly designed to encourage us. And the way in which
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.400]   it does it is this. It gives us these little pictures, these cameos, if you like, of a
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:41.000]   number of men, men who are familiar to us as eventually apostles, the men on whom the
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.600]   Church was founded. The Church is founded on the foundation of the prophets and apostles,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.120]   apostles and prophets. And we think of them as these great and exceptional men. We tend
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.000]   to forget that they started as very ordinary men. And here we see them as they were at
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.520]   the beginning. And we are shown in a very wonderful way some of the steps which a man
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.040]   passes through from the ordinary and the humdrum and the non-Christian, if you like, to the
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.720]   heights of receiving of His fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.080]   And therefore I think that there is nothing which can be more encouraging to us than to
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.600]   look at these pictures as they are set here before us.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:34.640]   Now we looked at the first picture last Sunday morning. John stood with two of his disciples
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:42.080]   and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God." And we saw how
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.760]   these two disciples, hearing this message, went after our Lord and how they spent the
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.560]   rest of the day and the night with Him. We worked out the details there. We saw that
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.480]   there were many wonderful lessons to be learned from those two. And their simple obedience
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.160]   to the indication of John the Baptist. They listened, they acted. And we saw how our blessed
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.880]   Lord encouraged them and took them with Him and gave them of His wonderful instruction.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.680]   Well now, that was the first picture and we go on this morning to the second. Let me remind
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.560]   you again that what we are dealing with here, of course, is actual history. But it's not
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.320]   only history, it's more than history. The history in the New Testament is a type of
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:39.520]   norm or pattern of what has always happened since. So as we study this history, we shall
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.000]   be confronting some of the great principles that govern this whole question. And what
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.360]   is of great value, particularly it seems to me, is this. That here you find the first
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.080]   beginnings only. These men were not baptized with the Holy Ghost at this point. We know
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.320]   that that happened to them later on the day of Pentecost. This was at least three years
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:08.680]   before that. But here you see the principles. The same principles. You see the blessed Lord
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.440]   Himself dealing with His people, acting upon them, beginning to prepare them, bringing
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:23.680]   them up to that place at which they will eventually be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Very well.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:32.880]   Now then, we've seen what happened to John the writer himself, undoubtedly, and Andrew.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.160]   But now I want to call before you two other men this morning. Well, not two other men,
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:44.760]   I'm still interested in Andrew. But I'm going to take with Andrew the case also of Philip.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:53.160]   And I take the two together for this reason. These are two comparatively unknown apostles.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.000]   We don't learn very much about them in the remainder of the Scriptures. They do appear,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.160]   and they generally appear together. But I'm taking them together on this occasion for
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:09.320]   this reason, that they both did the same thing. They reacted in the same way. And therefore
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:16.400]   it seems to me to be good and convenient that we should consider the two men together.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.080]   And as we look at these two again, there are certain principles taught us which of great
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.960]   value and I trust will be of great encouragement to us all as we look at them together this
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.680]   morning. Now, I'm not concerned primarily—let me make this quite clear—I'm not concerned
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.640]   primarily just to make a character study of Andrew and Philip. That's all right. It's
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.280]   a good thing to do. I'm interested in them from the standpoint I've been outlining.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:50.400]   I'm interested in them rather from the standpoint of the way in which our Lord deals with them.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.040]   And what we can learn as we look at them and follow their experience, bringing us ultimately
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.520]   to that great end. Very well, what are the lessons that are taught
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.760]   us here? Well, the first thing that we must note and comment on, obviously, is this one,
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:17.720]   that we are dealt with in different ways. Here we are, we come from different backgrounds,
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:24.920]   different nationalities, different temperaments, different everything. Ultimately we are all
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:31.640]   brought to the same place. Yes, but the way in which we are brought there can be very
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.680]   different. And I want to try to show the importance of making this point.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:42.440]   Now, take a man like Andrew. We know how he came. He was one of the disciples of John
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:50.920]   the Baptist. And he was standing with John the Evangelist by John the Baptist that afternoon
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:58.560]   when John the Baptist pointed at our Lord and said, "Behold the Lamb of God." And
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:06.160]   he went with John and listened to our Lord's teaching. That's how he came.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:15.600]   Now, that is what I would call the indirect method. But when you come to the case of Philip,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.640]   you find something different. The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   Philip and saith unto him, "Follow me." This is what I am describing as the direct.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:38.480]   And you see the difference between the two. The vast majority of people come to Christ
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.640]   and to a knowledge of this great salvation and eventually receive the fullness of the
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:52.520]   Spirit as the result of the teaching and the instruction of others. As the result of upbringing
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.880]   and training and instruction, perhaps in Sunday school or something like that, it's indirect.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.640]   But they arrive in the presence of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.680]   But that's not the only way. There is this other kind of experience. Here's a man like
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.440]   Philip. We don't know what he was doing, but there he was. We don't know much about
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.720]   his antecedents. But all we do know is this, that suddenly the Lord himself approached
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:27.840]   him. Nobody told him to go. Nobody took him to Jesus. Our Lord goes to him and suddenly
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.680]   deals with him and gives him this gracious invitation saying, "Follow me." And he
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680]   went.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.120]   Now, all I'm concerned to demonstrate this morning is that here at the very beginning
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:49.160]   of the activity of our Lord in his ministry, this great principle is put before us. And
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:58.440]   it clearly is a most important one. What it establishes is this, that there is nothing
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:07.120]   stereotyped about this Christian experience. And we must be very careful that we don't
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:15.320]   impose upon it some formula or some pattern, which we make inevitable and absolutely essential.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.440]   Now, I don't want to keep you with this particular point, but one has so often had
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.080]   to deal with people who've been in difficulties about this that I must note it. There are
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.560]   those who would standardize these matters and who insist upon all having exactly the
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:41.280]   same experience of this. There are those who would insist, for instance, that a man must
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.920]   be able to state the exact moment when he was converted. But if he can't tell you
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.480]   who the preacher was and what the text was and the date and how it happened, they doubt
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.640]   whether he's a Christian. It happened to them like that, and therefore they say it
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.360]   must happen to all like that. I remember many years ago, a man was talking to me in great
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:06.000]   trouble about his son. And I couldn't understand his anxiety because I knew this son and regarded
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.360]   him as a good Christian man. But the father was very troubled about him. And I found out
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.200]   from conversation that it was all due to this. The father kept on saying, "He hasn't
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   had the Damascus Road experience." The father had had a kind of Damascus Road experience.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   It had been a very dramatic conversion. But he didn't realize that because that had
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:31.040]   happened to him that his son had been brought up in a different way. But he was rather postulating
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.400]   that everybody must come to Christ in exactly the same way as he did.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:44.800]   Now that's the kind of thing against which I'm trying to safeguard you this morning.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:51.080]   But here, in this first chapter of John's Gospel, surely this history tells us that
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:59.080]   we must be very careful about this point, and that we must never insist upon some kind
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.920]   of identity or that people must go through a particular process. You see, our Lord himself,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:11.360]   he varies the procedure. He receives those who are sent to him by John the Baptist. He
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.720]   calls others himself. He receives those who are brought by Andrew and brought by Philip.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.680]   At once you find a great variety and variation. And this is but a little picture of what happens
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:31.800]   on a much bigger and on a much wider scale. It's always God's action. But he sometimes
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.840]   uses means, he sometimes doesn't. You see, this is a great principle, same principle
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.720]   exactly as you get in the matter of healing. Normally people are healed indirectly by the
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.360]   use of means. It's God who heals always, but sometimes by means indirectly. But when
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:58.160]   God chooses to do so, he can heal directly, without means. And here, you see, is an illustration.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.360]   There are people who say, "Never use means, never go to a doctor, never take any sort
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   of drug, always by faith." Well, it's a contradiction of a scriptural principle. It's
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:16.440]   the same God always, sometimes indirect, sometimes direct. End result the same. "Oh, but oh,
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.960]   the difference in the method. Why am I so concerned about this?" Well, I'm concerned
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.200]   about it for this reason. That this again is one of those great differentiating points
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:36.280]   between the Christian gospel and its way of salvation, and the cults. The cults are always
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:44.400]   stereotyped. The cults always do the same thing in exactly the same way. There's always
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:52.040]   an identity in the method as there is in the direct, in the result. Always the same. That
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.600]   is the way in which one can always recognize a cult. It's a sort of patent remedy. You
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.920]   do the same thing in the same way, and there's the same result. But you don't get that in
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.680]   the gospel. And that is the peculiar wonder and glory of the gospel. It's like God, of
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.080]   course, in creation. It's like God in all his works. You take these flowers or take
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.680]   anything else in nature, in a sense they're identical, and yet they're never identical.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   There's always some slight, subtle difference. And that is God's great way of working, I
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.920]   say, throughout his entire universe. I am therefore putting it in this form. Beware
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:40.320]   of any teaching which standardizes the procedure, which standardizes the method, which always
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:47.280]   works in exactly the same way. I'm suggesting, and remember, take the background of what
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.820]   we've been considering for months about the baptism with the Spirit and the counterfeits
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.440]   and all the possible dangers that come in along that line. Bearing all that in mind,
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:05.320]   here I say is a very great principle. If you find a number of people coming in the identical
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   manner and always the same, with this kind of patent stamp upon it, always a repetition,
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:18.600]   be suspicious. That belongs to psychology, that belongs to the cults. But in a most amazing
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.920]   way, it has been seen, not only in the New Testament, but in the long history of the
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:31.400]   Church, that it is not a characteristic of God's way in Christ of saving men and bringing
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.840]   them to a knowledge of himself. Well, all right, we leave it at that for this morning.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.720]   Andrew is sent. Our Lord himself comes to Philip and he says, "Follow me. My friend,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.220]   what matters this morning is not how you've come, what matters is the fact that you have
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:55.600]   come. He may have come to you in some secret, mystical moment. He may suddenly have appeared
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.280]   to you in his word or in some sense of his glorious presence. All right? Don't you
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.640]   standardize that. Don't you say that a man is not a Christian unless he's had that
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:12.360]   kind of experience. There is the indirect as well as the direct. Let us realize the
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:19.560]   freedom of the Spirit. The wind bloweth where it listereth. He blows when he likes, as he
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:26.200]   likes, where he likes. And you'll never be able to fit God's dealings with men in
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:34.500]   grace into some mechanical, rigid system. Remember Andrew and Philip and see this great
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   difference.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:42.580]   But now having shown this difference, let me come to the similarities, to the reason
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:49.260]   why I put them together. And this I would like to deal with under this kind of heavy
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:58.620]   tests as to whether we are on the way or not. That's what we want to know, isn't it?
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:09.060]   Are we on the way to this glorious experience of immediacy? Let me use that text which I
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.500]   have repeated so often these last months. Remember what Peter said about those unknown
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:22.300]   Christians whom, having not seen, he loved? "In whom, though now ye see him not yet
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:32.420]   believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory." The question I have
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.620]   been asking is this, "Is that true of you? Have you arrived there? Are you rejoicing
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:48.060]   in the Lord Jesus Christ this morning in a joy unspeakable, beyond expression, and full
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:57.540]   of glory?" Well, I am concerned to speak to those who say, "Would to God I could
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:03.100]   say that, but I can't." And indeed, you not only say to me that you can't say that,
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.260]   you may even be saying in your heart, "I don't think I ever shall be. It's beyond
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.260]   me. It's impossible."
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.180]   Well, I remind you again that Peter wrote that not about apostles, not about some exceptional
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.900]   saints. He didn't even know their names. The strangers scattered abroad throughout
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.060]   Cappadocia, Asia, and all the rest of it. He didn't know. Ordinary people. Slaves,
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.100]   many of them. But that was true of them. And what I am concerned to do is this. Would you
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.860]   like to know that you are on the way to that, even if you haven't got there? Would you
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.260]   like to know and feel that you are on the way, that it's a possibility? Is there something
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.420]   about you that gives you the assurance that although you haven't got there, you are
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   on the way to getting there? I want to help such people, and this is how I do it.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:53.140]   One of the tests, I say, that we are on the way. Now, these men we are looking at, they
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.180]   haven't yet been baptized with the Holy Ghost. This is the very beginning. They're
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:06.140]   a very long way off. But they're on the way. Let's discover what we can from these
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:12.820]   men as to the signs that we at Inuit have started, that there's something happened
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.420]   which means that he's started dealing with us and we're going to get there. What's
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:26.020]   the first thing? Well, the first test is this. That there is within us an urge to tell others
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:34.260]   about him and what we have experienced of him hitherto so far. This is put before us
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:41.700]   in a very striking way. There's a word used here with respect to Andrew, which is important.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.460]   One of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:54.580]   brother. Listen, "He first, he first findeth Simon, his own brother Simon, and saith unto
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.340]   him, We have found the Messiah." Now, you noticed I emphasized the word "first."
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.700]   And it is to be emphasized. Everybody has agreed about this. What's it mean? Well,
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:10.780]   some say it means this. Andrew first found Simon. In other words, that he and John, the
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.020]   moment they left to the place where our Lord was staying, they both rushed out and they
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.140]   both said, "We must tell Peter to tell Simon about this." But that Andrew got there
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:29.060]   first. Some say it's that. It may be, it may not be. Another explanation is this.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:37.660]   That Andrew and John, coming out of our Lord's lodging place, immediately went off. Andrew
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.340]   said, "I must tell my brother Simon." And John said, "I must tell my brother James."
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:50.580]   But that Andrew got in first. Andrew reached Simon before John reached James. And then
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.660]   a third possible explanation is that Andrew first found Simon and later Simon found many
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.220]   others. Now, I prefer the first two explanations because I'm sure that's right. You see,
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:08.700]   what they bring out is this, the urgency. He first, he rushed. You can almost see the
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:15.260]   two men running down the road in order to tell their respective brothers and relatives.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:22.140]   Now here is the first thing you see we are told about these two men. They've spent
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:30.020]   that, whatever it was, whether it was afternoon and evening and night or only evening and
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.100]   night, it all depends whether John was using the Hebrew or the Roman system of time. It
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.220]   doesn't matter. What is certain is that they spent some time with him. And at length, the
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:46.860]   end of the conversation came and the two men are out. And off they go. And you notice exactly
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:52.500]   the same thing about Philip. "Our Lord calls Philip, says, 'Follow me.' Now Philip was
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.220]   of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael." Same thing precisely.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.820]   And this, therefore, is obviously something which is of great importance for us. Now,
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.460]   you notice the spontaneity of it. And I'm very concerned to emphasize that. They were
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.460]   not taught to do this. They were not trained to do this. They didn't attend the class
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.940]   in which they were told how to fish or how to approach others. And they were not given
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:22.820]   a little manual how to win souls for Christ. My dear friends, there wasn't anything like
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.420]   that in the early Church. And there's something wrong with the Church when she has to come
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:32.820]   to that. What's gone wrong with the Christian Church? That's what we're doing today. And
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:39.180]   they're talking about advertising the Church today, getting a sort of commercial to advertise
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:46.180]   the Church. Why don't they read the New Testament? This is how Christianity is spread. You don't
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:54.420]   have to pay for advertisements. You don't need all these mechanical aids. Andrew and
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.460]   John sit and listen to him. They sit at his feet. And when it's finished, you see them
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:06.300]   running down the road. That's Christianity. Philip does exactly the same thing. What is
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:12.100]   it? Well, you see, there's a constraint here, an element of constraint. And as you go through
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.540]   your New Testament, you'll find this thing constantly repeated in the fourth chapter
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:23.980]   of this very selfsame Gospel. You've got another illustration of precisely the same
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.420]   thing. Our Lord dealing with a woman of some area of all people in the world, a woman who'd
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.020]   been living a life of adultery and of sin. But our Lord begins to speak to her, and you
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:39.020]   remember what happens. And this is what I read. "Upon this came his disciples, and
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.540]   marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, 'What seekest thou, or why
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.540]   talkest thou with her?' The woman then left her waterpot." Remember, she'd gone there
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.060]   to draw water. She'd got her waterpot with her. But as a result of meeting with Jesus
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.780]   Christ, she forgets all about the waterpot. "The woman then left her waterpot, and went
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.260]   on her way into the city, and said to the men, 'Come, see a man which did tell me all
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:06.580]   things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ?' Then they went out of the city and came unto
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:13.020]   him." That's it, same thing. And you notice the same element comes out, this spontaneity,
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.340]   this sense of urgency, this sense of constraint. And then as you go on to the book of the Acts
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:25.940]   of the Apostles, you find these apostles now filled with the Spirit. They get up in Jerusalem
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:30.380]   and Peter preaches in spite of the authorities. Then they're arrested and they're told not
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.500]   to do it, and they're arraigned before the court, and there's only one answer that they
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:41.900]   can give, "We cannot but speak, we must." Same thing. The apostle Paul, he frequently
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:48.700]   brings out this same point. This is the way in which he tends to put it. "You may ask
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:55.700]   me," says Paul, "why I'm so busy traveling over continents preaching this gospel. I'll
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:01.500]   give you the answer," he says, "I am a debtor, I am a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:08.100]   barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise." He looks at the Corinthians and he says, "Woe
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.420]   is unto me if I preach not the gospel." That's why I'm doing it, I'm bound to. I can't help
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:18.820]   myself. "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel." And then he reaches the topmost level,
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.220]   "The love of Christ constrains me like a man in a vice," and it's being tightened, tighter
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:30.500]   and tighter, it's being pressed out of me. There's a pressure upon my soul and my spirit.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.900]   Now there you get it at its acme. All I'm trying to show you is that here at the very
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:43.700]   beginning, long before the day of Pentecost, these men who had been with him felt this
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:51.100]   great desire to go at once and to tell others, especially their nearest and dearest. Andrew
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:58.660]   finds his own brother, Simon. According to the learned authorities, his own brother means
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.940]   that Simon was not only his brother, but he was very fond of him, he was very dear to
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:09.740]   him. Brothers are not always loving to one another. Brothers can be enemies, but these
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.980]   were not only physical brothers and relatives, but they were very fond of one another. And
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.380]   so when Andrew gets down, he runs down the street, "I must tell Simon, my brother, my
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:24.900]   nearest, my dearest." He wants him to know about this. And it's exactly the same with
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:32.820]   Philip when he finds Nathaniel. Now, all I'm trying to do, my dear friend,
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:39.780]   is to hold this picture before you, and I'm doing so in the form of a question. Do we
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:47.020]   know anything about this? Have we at any rate arrived at the point when something of that
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:53.780]   is in us? Why, you know, then, well, let me come to the second point, which is this. Why
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:58.700]   did they do this? Why did Andrew do that? Why did Philip do the same thing? And you
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:06.580]   notice they both use exactly the same expression. Andrew first findeth his own brother, Simon,
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:13.020]   and saith unto him, "We have found." Listen to Philip. Philip findeth Nathaniel, and saith
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:21.260]   unto him, "We have found him." Here it is, my friends, "We have found." This is
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:28.740]   the thing that explains the constraint, the desire, this burning desire to tell others,
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:36.060]   especially your nearest and dearest, "We have found." What does it mean? Well, perhaps
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:42.780]   it would be most helpful if I put it in the negative as the contrast to the negatives.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:52.620]   You see, these men were no longer looking for something. They had found him. There are
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:58.780]   many people calling themselves Christians, but who, if you speak to them, will tell you
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:05.180]   quite frankly that their position is that they're looking for something, seekers after
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:12.220]   truth, dissatisfied with life and looking for something. So they listen to sermons,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.500]   to lectures, read books. They're looking. And there are people, indeed, who go so far
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.100]   as to say that that is the highest form of Christianity, that you're a seeker, and
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.820]   that the Christian, essentially, as the men, was out in this great quest for truth. I can't
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.780]   recall whether I've ever told you before of what I read in a book once. A man writing
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:37.500]   along this line said, "If you came to me," he said, "and held in your right hand the
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:44.100]   quest for truth and the thrill and the excitement and the intellectual interest and the emotional
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.820]   zeal and fervor of the quest for truth, and if you held in your left hand," he said,
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.500]   "the results of arriving at the truth and you offered them to me and said you can take
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.060]   your choice," he said, "I would without any hesitation choose that which you've
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.980]   got in your right hand." It's the quest, the thrill and the excitement of the search,
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:11.860]   seekers and searchers after truth. That's not what you get in the New Testament. We
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:19.260]   are found. It's a proclamation. It is an announcement.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:25.300]   Neither is the Christian just a man who is hoping to find. He's gone beyond just enjoying
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:30.420]   the chase. But he's now saying, "Oh, I can't say that I am a Christian. I really
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:39.460]   don't know. But I'm hoping that sometime or another before I die, I may." Then there
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:46.620]   are many others to whom their religion is a duty and a task. They feel it's the right
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:54.380]   thing to do. They've got an interest in the moral affairs of this or some other country,
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.620]   and they feel it's the right thing to do. So they do it as a duty, dutifully. It mustn't
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.780]   be too long, of course. You just do it, then, "Right, done it for this next Sunday."
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.420]   All is well. Religion is a task and is a duty. Well, we needn't argue about these things.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.340]   All I'm saying is this. My dear friends, if that's your position, you're totally
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:19.700]   unlike these men. I don't think you've started. You haven't started at all. What
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:26.020]   is basic about the man who's eventually going to receive of this gratefulness is that
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:32.780]   he's already got something. "And to him that hath shall be given, but from him that
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:39.020]   hath not shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have." It's a very solemn thing,
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.860]   this. Oh, I'm saying this for encouragement. All I'm asking is not to understand the
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.420]   whole of Christian doctrine. I'm just asking, "Have you got something which makes you
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:55.060]   say, 'We've found, and I want you to know.'" No, it's not negative, because, obviously,
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.940]   a man who's merely seeking for truth, he can't help anybody else. He doesn't rush
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:04.740]   to tell another man the good news. Of course he doesn't, because he hasn't got anything.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.140]   It's no use just hoping or looking for. What's the value of saying to a man, "You know,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.980]   I've been in this great quest for truth. It's very exciting. You know, I'm told
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.740]   a wonderful book's coming out next week, and I'm greatly looking forward to reading
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:22.340]   that." What's the value of that? That's not Andrew. That's not Philip.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:32.820]   We have found. No, no, those things are of no value. That's not Christianity. The Christian,
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:41.900]   as a basic minimum, is able to say, "I have found." Now, I'm putting it in this
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:48.340]   form that he has this urge to tell others. You know, it needn't be a burning urge,
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:53.700]   it needn't be the height of the mountain with the Apostle Paul. No, no, but there's
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.140]   something in him he feels when he talks to people, especially those who are near and
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.500]   dear to him. He says, "I must tell them about this." He's got that much. I'm
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:08.540]   putting it at its minimum. And I'm putting it in this form, that he is not an advocate,
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:15.100]   but he's a witness. You know what an advocate is. He's a man who's given a brief, not
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:20.700]   interested in it. But here's somebody's case, and the brief has been prepared by
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.820]   a solicitor or somebody, and he reads and takes up the brief, and he handles it in court.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.180]   And at times he does it so well, he almost persuades you that he really believes it.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:34.020]   But he's not involved. It's all objective. It's right outside him. He's doing his
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.820]   best for his client. He's going to be paid a fee, and it'll help him to get on and
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:44.100]   so on. But that's an advocate. Now, these people are not advocates. These are witnesses.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:49.860]   You see, there's another element that's come in. These men were not merely expounders
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:56.500]   of something outside them. They were saying, "We have found." In a sense, they're
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:06.940]   giving their experience. This is always something vital. It's always living. It has always
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:14.820]   got the experimental or the experiential element in it, invariably. There it is, the difference
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:20.660]   between a man who has an intellectual interest in the gospel and a man who rarely has it
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:27.980]   inside him. He's on the way. There's a warmth. There's an urgency. There's a
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:35.300]   desire. He is speaking out of a kind of fullness that he's already received.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:41.340]   But then I must go on to the next step. That's why they do it. They do it because they've
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:46.780]   found. I must go and tell Simon that we've found him. And Philip says, "I must tell
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:54.300]   Nathaniel that I've found him. He's found me, and I've found him." That's the
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.100]   reason why they do it. But let me emphasize again the nature of the testimony. And this
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:05.740]   is all important. You notice that there are two elements in what they say and what they
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:15.220]   report. One is the one I've just been describing, the experimental aspect. But it doesn't
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:22.340]   stop at experience. There is experience. There must be experience. We are, I say, witnesses
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:28.100]   and not advocates. The person is involved, and it comes out of his heart. But it doesn't
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:34.380]   only come from his heart. Here, at the very beginning, at this inchoate stage, you can't
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:39.380]   go further back than this. Nevertheless, there is the other element. What is it? The element
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:45.700]   of understanding. Listen. "He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him,
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:52.140]   We have found the Messiah." Listen to Philip. "Philip findeth Nathaniel, and saith unto
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:58.700]   him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:07.300]   the son of Joseph." You notice? Messiah. "Him of whom Moses and the prophets did
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:14.740]   write." Here is the intellectual content, the intellectual element. It is not merely
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:22.380]   relating an experience. Now there is an element of teaching. Now, here again is something
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:27.300]   you will find that is emphasized everywhere in the whole of the New Testament. Peter,
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.140]   later on in writing his first epistle and in the third chapter, he puts it like this.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:38.940]   He says, "Be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in you." And
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:46.020]   there you have got the two things. The hope is in you, but you can give a reason for it.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:53.460]   This I say again we must be clear about, because it is one of those points at which again we
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.980]   can differentiate the Christian experience from the kind of experience that is given
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:04.860]   by the cults. And when I say the cults, I am thinking of things like Christian science,
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:11.260]   positive thinking, and all the rest of it. You see, now it is no use denying that they
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.020]   can give people experiences. They can. They would not thrive but for that. They can make
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.740]   people feel happy. They can make them forget their problems. They can make some people
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.900]   sleep with suffering from insomnia. They can do a thousand and one things, heal odd aches
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:32.020]   and pains and so on. And there it is. And they tell one another about their experiences.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:37.780]   Now there is always the danger that the devil will counterfeit the true Christian experience
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:44.660]   in some such manner as that. And he produces people who simply give an experience of something
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:51.500]   marvellous and wonderful that has happened to them, or that they can do. And no more.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.460]   They cannot give a reason. They cannot give any kind of explanation. There is no teaching.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:03.220]   Here I say at the very beginning it has been given to us by God himself that we are to
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:08.980]   be careful at this point. Here are these men in the very first... Oh, they were mere tyrants.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.420]   They were full of ignorance, as I can show you. And yet, you see, they do not merely
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.500]   say I have had a marvellous experience, I felt something wonderful. No, no. They say
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:28.020]   we have found him, we have found the Messiah, which I therefore translate in this form.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:36.660]   If you want to go from this service with the satisfaction that you are, however imperfect,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:44.100]   nevertheless on the way, that you have a hope of something bigger and greater and ampler,
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:50.780]   well here is a part of the test. That you have an elementary understanding at any rate
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:59.420]   of God's plan and purpose, the Messiah. That you look upon life and upon yourself and upon
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:05.660]   the whole world and its past, its present and its future, in the light of this revelation,
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:15.620]   God's plan and purpose of redemption, a Messiah, a deliverer. And that you know that
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:23.940]   Jesus of Nazareth is this Messiah. You have got me on the stage of arguing and debating.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:29.860]   You know. You have listened to John the Baptist, he said, I have come to the conclusion, I
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:39.660]   saw on bare record that this is the Son of God. And you have come to the same conclusion.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.260]   Now, I don't argue about this, all I am saying is this, that no man is going to experience
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:50.780]   his fullness or be baptized with the Spirit unless he is already clear about this, that
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:56.900]   Jesus is the Son of God. He is the Messiah, he is the deliverer. That he does so by becoming
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:02.380]   the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. That salvation is in him and in
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.500]   him alone. You can have experiences without that. It won't be Christian. You may say,
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.620]   but I am very happy. All right, I know you are. Cults can make people happy, psychology
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:23.580]   can, drugs can. He makes you happy always through giving you an understanding. We affirm
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:30.060]   the Messiah, him of whom Moses and the prophets did write. But as I say again, let's not
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:36.580]   emphasize the one at the expense of the other. The Christian is a man who not only has the
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.380]   understanding but because he has understood it, it has thrilled him, it has moved him.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:52.140]   So he rushes down the road. We have found him. The long expected Messiah has come. Andrew
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:58.380]   and Philip had arrived at the end of their quest. They had found rest and peace for their
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:03.820]   souls. They don't understand it all. Of course they don't. They blunder later on, as they
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:08.380]   all did. They stumbled when he told them that he was going to die. You see, I am not asking
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:12.340]   you for a complete understanding. All I am asking you is this, that in some shape or
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:17.820]   form you say, I have found him and he has found me. I have got a rest, which I never
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:24.820]   knew before. I don't understand everything. I don't understand much indeed. But I have
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:31.420]   got something, I have found something. And I am different as the result of it. And I
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.220]   want to tell you about it. So that brings me to my last heading, which is this. You
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:43.340]   notice that Andrew and Philip do exactly the same thing. Their great desire is to bring
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:49.820]   these loved ones of theirs to Jesus. You notice the expression. We have found the Messiah,
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:55.420]   which is being interpreted, the Christ, and he brought him to Jesus. Philip, what does
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:00.700]   he do? Well, he does exactly the same thing. He tells Nathaniel. Nathaniel, as I am hoping
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:06.660]   to show on a subsequent Sunday morning, has a bit of an argument and stumbles. He says,
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.380]   can't there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? And all Philip says in reply to
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:17.980]   him is this, come and see. Now what does this mean? Well, let me summarize it hurriedly
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:26.460]   as I close like this. The one thing these two men desired for their loved ones was that
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:32.900]   they should come to Jesus, come and see him. It is clear in the case of Philip that he
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.980]   couldn't answer Nathaniel's question. You see, you can be as simple as that, that you
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.380]   can't answer. You talk to your loved ones and your friends and they put up some scientific
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.460]   argument. Now don't try and answer them when you can't. You just say, well, all I know
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:56.180]   is this, you come to him. I can't answer you, but I know he can. That's it. Philip can't
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:03.020]   answer. So he says to Nathaniel, you come with me and you meet him, he'll answer you.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.900]   What do I mean? Well, I'll put it like this as a principle. Do you know something of this
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:13.060]   that you're full of misunderstandings and difficulties and problems and perplexities
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.060]   perhaps, but this is what you know and this is what you feel, that Jesus Christ is the
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:26.860]   answer to it all. You are not, he is. And all you say is this, we only need to know
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:33.860]   him more to understand more. He'll resolve all our problems, he'll answer all our questions.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:39.420]   He is the yea and the amen. He is the light of the world and all the fullness of the Godhead
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.580]   dwelleth bodily in him. Now that's it, you see, you can't do more, but you can do that.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:47.980]   And this is all I'm asking. Have you got the desire in you, you feel about these people?
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:56.140]   Oh, if only they had some sort of meeting with him. That's all you're attempting to
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:05.380]   do for them. Shall I therefore sum it all up by putting it like this? Let me try to
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:12.460]   use some kind of picture or illustration. I've already quoted the Apostle Paul in Romans
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:18.180]   1, 14. I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:24.140]   the unwise. So as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:30.060]   also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, by which he means I'm tremendously
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:39.700]   proud of it. Why? Well, he says, it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:48.420]   believeth. Now, a way back about 1911, a man discovered an old papyrus in a rubbish heap
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:56.620]   in Egypt. And there he handed it over to the authorities and they were able to make this
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:02.540]   statement, and it's been abundantly confirmed since, that the word translated "power"
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.180]   there, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:14.740]   to every one that believeth, was also used for the word which we now call "prescription".
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:21.700]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the prescription of God unto salvation
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:28.100]   to every one that believeth. So I put it to you like this. This is how Andrew felt, this
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:33.380]   is how Philip felt, this is how the others began to feel, this is how Christian people
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.180]   at the very minimum have always felt. That's why I'm holding it before you as a test.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:47.140]   I'm holding it like this. Imagine that you had been suffering from some disease which
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:54.260]   had given you great pain, and perhaps it affected your joints so that you could scarcely move
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.500]   without agony, and eventually reached a stage in which you couldn't move at all. Here
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.620]   you are with this painful, crippling disease of your joints. And you went to your doctor,
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.540]   he did his best, couldn't help you, went to another, and on you went up the line until
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.500]   you arrived at the supreme authority in Great Britain on this disease. Couldn't help you.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.380]   You heard of somebody on the continent, you went there. You heard of some spa, you visited
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:21.380]   that, still no better. And you'd gone this great round of all these great doctors and
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:33.740]   physicians throughout Europe, still no better. Then, somebody told you one day of a doctor
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:41.020]   who was able invariably and infallibly to cure such cases. And you went to see him.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.940]   And the moment you saw him, and he looked at you, you realised that there was something
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:50.300]   different about him. There was an authority, a quiet authority, he seemed to understand.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.100]   And he looked at you and he said, "Yes, I know it exactly, and I can put you right."
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:59.780]   And he sat down and he wrote out his prescription. And he said, "Now you go and get that and
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:04.300]   you take it and you'll find the pain will diminish, gradually your joints will become
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.660]   loose and more supple and you'll be able to walk as well as you've ever walked in your
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.700]   life. You took the prescription, you've got the medicine made up and you took it and as
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.780]   he said, so it happened. And you regained your health perfectly, absolutely. And you
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.940]   now walk about life with this great prescription in your pocket. One day you're walking up
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.060]   the road and you see a man on the other side. You don't know him, but you know what's the
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.900]   matter with him. He's got your old complaint. You can tell by the way he's holding himself,
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.580]   the way he's struggling with his gait and walking. He's got your old complaint. Yes,
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.940]   but you know more. Obviously he's never heard of this prescription that you've got in your
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:46.100]   pocket. What do you do about him? Well, there's no need to argue. There's only one thing to
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.540]   do. You've just got to cross the road. You've got to accost that man and say, "Excuse me,
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.260]   sir, you don't know me and I don't know you, but I do know what's the matter with you.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:59.940]   Have you ever heard of this, producing your prescription?" You feel you've got to tell
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.860]   him. You feel you'd be a cab if you didn't tell him. You know of a cure. He doesn't.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:10.260]   You've got your old complaint and you know the answer. And you go and tell him about
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:15.620]   it. And you tell him about this great physician, this great doctor that gave it to you. Isn't
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.700]   that what people do when they get such an experience? They're so grateful to this physician.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.020]   They so admire him. They want everybody to go to him. They're always giving his name.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:30.820]   They're urging people to go to him so that he may have the glory and the people may have
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:38.660]   the benefit of his wonderful prescription. That's why Andrew ran down the road to tell
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:47.820]   Simon. That's why Philip found Nathaniel. You don't understand the ingredients in the
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:53.500]   prescription. All you know that it's here and it does it. And you want all who are in
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:58.900]   trouble still and suffering to be healed, to be cured. Come and see. He took him to
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:08.900]   Jesus. All I'm asking, my dear friend, is as simple as this. Do you know enough about
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:19.100]   him? Have you sufficient experience of him to desire the whole world to know him? Do
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:24.660]   you long that all who are near and dear to you may go to him? Is it your greatest desire
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:33.660]   to bring everybody to him? Is it your desire that he may have all the glory and may have
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:41.860]   all the honor? Do you long for the day when at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:48.380]   of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth, and every tongue shall
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:58.100]   confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father? Do you know anything about
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:08.860]   that? If you do, it's my privilege to give you this assurance. You are on the way. If
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:16.300]   you know enough about him to know that he is the angel, and even as you are, you know
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:24.860]   enough about him to have found a rest and you're longing for others to come to him,
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:33.660]   that they may know him and see him and feel the touch of his power. From these simple
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:43.340]   beginnings he leads us on to that ultimate baptism with the Holy Ghost and our receiving
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:50.580]   of his fullness and grace upon grace. Amen.
