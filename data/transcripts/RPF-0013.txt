[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.600]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 13
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:51.800]   [Music]
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.200]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, July 3, 2014.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.100]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.000]   On today's show, a continuation, a history of retirement.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.900]   Is retirement actually about the retiree?
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.700]   Or is the idea of retirement actually intended to benefit somebody else?
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.200]   Stay with us.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:27.800]   [Music]
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.900]   So thanks for being here with us today for our episode number 13.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900]   I'm excited about today's show.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.600]   Of course, I'm excited about every day's show, otherwise I wouldn't be doing this, right?
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.100]   What's the point of doing it if you're not excited about what you're doing?
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.500]   However, in today's show, we're going to talk about some things
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.400]   that I have never actually heard discussed in financial media.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   And today's show is going to be a little bit different.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500]   Plan to be more of, I'll call it a working show.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.100]   So the idea behind today's show is not to give a presentation with a specific agenda
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.300]   or to give a presentation with a specific conclusion,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.600]   but rather to have a working show and to give some information.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.500]   And we're going to talk a little bit about the history of retirement.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.300]   Why are we doing this?
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.700]   Well, let's start with the problem.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.700]   Let me read a very short article here,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.900]   and this sums up what you will see often in the news these days.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.000]   This article, entitled "The Greatest Retirement Crisis in American History" by Ted Seidel,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.900]   and this is written in Forbes, March 20, 2013.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.800]   "We are on the precipice of the greatest retirement crisis in the history of the world.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.000]   In the decades to come, we will witness millions of elderly Americans,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.400]   the baby boomers and others, slipping into poverty.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   Too frail to work, too poor to retire will become the new normal for many elderly Americans.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   That dire prediction, which I wrote two years ago, is already coming true.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   Our national demographics, coupled with indisputably glaring insufficient retirement savings
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.600]   and human physiology, suggest that a catastrophic outcome
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   for at least a significant percentage of our elderly population is inevitable.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   With the average 401(k) balance for 65-year-olds estimated at $25,000 by independent experts
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   - $100,000 if you believe the retirement planning industry -
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   the decades many elders will spend in forced or elected retirement will be grim.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   Corporate America and the financial wizards behind the past three decades of so-called retirement innovations,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.000]   most notably titans of the pension benefits consulting and mutual fund 401(k) industries,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.400]   are downplaying just how bad things are already and how much worse they are going to get.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Americans today are aware that corporate pensions have been virtually eliminated
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.000]   and that the few remaining private as well as the nation's public pensions are in jeopardy.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.400]   Even if you are among the lucky few that have a pension,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.000]   you cannot rest assured that it will be there for all the years you'll need it.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.400]   Whether you know it or not, someone is busy trying to figure out how to screw you out of your pension.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   Americans also know the great 401(k) experiment of the past 30 years has been a disaster.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.200]   It is now apparent that 401(k)s will not provide the retirement security promised to workers.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.000]   As a former mutual fund legal counsel, when I recall some of the outrageous sales materials
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.200]   the industry came up with to peddle funds to workers, particularly in the 1980s,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   it's almost laughable if the results weren't so tragic.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   There was the "dial your own return" cardboard wheel of fortune
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.800]   that showed investors which mutual funds they should select for any given level of return.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.200]   Looking for 12%? Load up on our "government plus" or option income funds.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.800]   It was that easy to get that level of income needed in retirement, investors were told.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.600]   The signs of the coming retirement crisis are all around you.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.200]   Who's bagging your groceries? A young high school kid or an older retiree
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.800]   who had to go back to work to supplement his income or qualify for health insurance?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   The impending crisis will come in what I call "waves" as opposed to a tsunami hitting all at once.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.600]   With each successive wave, more elderly will be drowned.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.400]   The older you are, the harder it is to recover from a setback.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.600]   Wave 1. Retirees come back to work.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.200]   Workers who retired post-2000 realized they cannot possibly live on their meager retirement savings,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.800]   virtually no interest and limited health benefits, and conclude they must go back to work full-time.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.400]   For example, one of my clients, a sheriff's office, has already seen retirees coming back to work
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.600]   largely for health insurance coverage.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   While these retirees do have pensions, the cost of health insurance, when not subsidized by an employer,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.000]   is far greater than they had anticipated.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.400]   For those who are physically and mentally capable of going back to work
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.800]   and are welcomed by their former employers or other employers, this is a plausible survival strategy.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.600]   Wave 2. Workers delay full retirement.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.400]   Many current workers realize they have not saved enough to retire
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   and postpone retirement for a certain number of years.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.600]   They still believe, however, that someday they will be able to retire and live off their savings.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.400]   This strategy makes sense for workers who can hang on to their jobs at the same or better pay
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.200]   and are healthy enough to keep working.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.800]   On the other hand, older workers who are forced by employers to agree to demotions, pay cuts,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.400]   or part-time status to stay on may feel demoralized.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.600]   Wave 3. Full retirement is unachievable.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.400]   Many current workers and retirees at some point realize that they can never fully retire,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.200]   i.e. stop working altogether, and commit to working part-time for as many of their golden years as possible.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.000]   The problem is, of course, that each year more elderly people become too frail to work
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.200]   and fewer employers are interested in hiring them, even on a part-time basis.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Remember those ads that said, "It's hell to be 40 and out of work"?
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.800]   Try looking for work at 70 or 80.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   Wave 4. Drowning.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.400]   At some point, lack of savings, lack of employment possibilities, and failing health
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.600]   will catch up with the overwhelming majority of the nation's elders.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.200]   Let me emphasize that we're talking about the overwhelming majority,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.800]   not a small percentage who arguably made bad decisions throughout their working lives.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.400]   Given the certainty that a retirement crisis is headed toward our shores,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   you'd think that our elected officials would be hard at work preparing a response.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   Of course, that's not happening.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.800]   To the contrary, conservatives are trying to pare back so-called entitlements that will mushroom in the near future,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.000]   and liberals have failed to acknowledge the crisis or propose any solutions.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.200]   Eventually, the pain will be so widespread that the crisis will be impossible to ignore.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.600]   For many, the challenge is to hang in there until help arrives.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.400]   It's a good outline of the problem.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.000]   I chose it because it's a little bit sensational, but I don't think the author overstates the facts.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   We do have major problems with retirement, as I started to discuss yesterday.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.800]   The problem is affecting and will affect every single American.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:01.400]   Hopefully, my goal through the process of this show is to help guide people out of the problem and into solutions.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.600]   But it's first important to acknowledge the situation that exists.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.400]   Demographically speaking, there are a huge number of baby boomers headed toward retirement.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:17.600]   Financially speaking, those baby boomers do not have enough money to live on based upon assets,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   which is basically what every single TV commercial for every financial services company would lead you to believe.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:31.200]   You see the picture of the wealthy couple strolling down the beach.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   Does that happen? Yes.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.800]   I have a few clients that are in that situation, but they are rare and unique.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.000]   This is not normal.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.800]   So we need new strategies that work in every situation.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.400]   It's important to acknowledge the pressure that's coming.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   Social Security, Medicare are woefully underfunded.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.800]   Medicare substantially more than Social Security.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.000]   We'll talk about that in detail at some point in the future.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   But this chicken will come home to roost in the future.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.800]   This is going to create significant adjustments, and there are going to be significant adjustments in the systems that exist currently.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.000]   This is not abnormal.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.200]   Social Security has been adjusted many times.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   We'll discuss that in a future show and kind of talk through how it's been adjusted.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.600]   It will be adjusted again.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   And it's going to take some major changes to make things work.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.200]   How it's all going to work, I don't know.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.800]   But we'll watch it as the years go by.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   Many people are of the opinion that the retiring baby boomers, as they spend down assets, that that will affect capital markets.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   We'll discuss that in detail at some point in the future.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.200]   It's certainly going to affect taxes.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.800]   Taxes certainly have to be adjusted, especially Social Security taxes.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   The number of wage payers per retiree decreases and continues to decrease over time.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.200]   So I've struggled, me personally, thinking through all these aspects of the problem.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.400]   And I've looked, trying to understand answers.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.600]   It's hard to find good answers.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.800]   In the current society, it's very easy to read articles.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.200]   I'll read a lot of articles in the show, as you can see from the past few days.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   But articles, generally, what, four minutes to read it?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.600]   It's hard to get an answer.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   So I've tried to figure out some of the history.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:23.400]   Now, all the history, generally, as I was growing up, I was under the assumption that retirement was something that everybody was going to do.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.800]   Retirement was something that everybody should be planning for.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.000]   And that this is going to be a reality for everybody.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.600]   And if you would just be smart enough to save $100 a month, you'd be a millionaire and everything would be good.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   But I've learned that my viewpoints, I guess, were a little bit naive.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.000]   And so I've gone looking for books on history.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.200]   And I found two.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.000]   And today, we're going to be talking extensively from a book entitled "A History of Retirement."
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.200]   And the author of this book is a man named William Grabener.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.400]   And I read this book, would recommend it to you.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.800]   You can find it on Amazon.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.000]   It's out of print.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.400]   So you'll have to look for it on the used market.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.600]   It's substantially priced, if you look at it on Amazon.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.800]   The book was printed in 1980, copyright 1980, by Yale University Press.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:22.000]   And William Grabener is a college professor who -- the subtitle of the book is called "The Meaning and Function of an American Institution from 1885 to 1978."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.200]   And when I found this book, I really soaked it up because it helped me to understand some of the history.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   Now, as with any book on history, you have to figure out, is the book that I'm reading, is it history?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   Is it a revision of history?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   From what angle is the history?
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.800]   I'm going to basically ignore most of that controversy.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.200]   Although I would point out -- I found an interesting review of this book.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   I would point out that it may not -- that you have the author's point of view.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.200]   Here's one interesting review.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.600]   This is a review that was written by a man named James Patterson, who was from the Department of History at Brown University.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   And his review of this book -- "This vigorously revisionist treatment of ideas and policies concerning retirement manages to illuminate much about American economic and political life in the 20th century.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.600]   Grabener's interpretation, though not his tone, resembles that of Francis Fox Pivot and Richard Cloward,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.800]   who emphasized the importance of corporate needs in the evolution of 20th century social programs.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.000]   Indeed, Grabener seeks a legitimate radical critique of social welfare policies.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.800]   With the development of corporate capitalism, he says, business leaders "become less concerned with immediate profit and more interested in long-term stability."
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   The review continues.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.000]   When I read things like that, I always bristle a little bit.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.200]   I'm not a fan of revisionist history.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   But I find it -- reading books like this to be a much more solid place, because then you have footnotes and can continue to seek it out.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   I'm still young in my journey of looking through this.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.600]   I'm very interested in finding good answers.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:06.200]   Another book that -- I haven't read it yet, but there's another book entitled "The Evolution of Retirement in American Economic History from 1880 to 1990."
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   This is published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   The author is a lady named Costa, Doris or Dora Costa.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   Doris, Dora, something like that.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   This one is also available, used on Amazon.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   The price is pretty high.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   If you pull up the National Bureau of Economic Research, you can actually find it for free as a PDF, a downloadable PDF on their website.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   I will read this one and review it in the future as well.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   But these answers are tough to find.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   "Yesterday I tried just to illustrate in my own way kind of the absurdity of the idea that everyone just wants to retire and play golf in Florida.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   Are there a lot of people who want to do that?
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   Absolutely.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   But I've tried to figure out where did this idea of inactivity come from?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   If Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Tim Ferriss and Jacob Lundfisker -- and if none of these people retire, quote/unquote, kick back at 65 and play golf every day,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   then where did this idea that this is what we should be working toward come from?
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   Why did the idea of retiring at 65 become such a universally accepted goal?"
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   So this book -- I'm going to read some excerpts from it today, and that's going to be the bulk of today's show to provide you with those excerpts.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   This book, I think, helps me to give a little bit of an idea.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   And what I'm learning is that it's far more complicated than is usual with most things in history.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   It's far more complicated than it would seem right at the front end.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   It's hard for me to figure out when I look at things like this.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   It's hard for me to figure out whether the results are intentional or unintentional.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   Sometimes you look at the circumstances of a situation that we have today and you say, "Was this a conspiracy?
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   Was this a group of people planning out what would happen?
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   Or did this happen organically and it just simply wound up with these expected results?"
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   And generally, I can't usually figure out the answer to that.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   I can't usually actually figure out what the real answer is to that.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   However, this show is going to be my effort at kind of giving a little bit of the history.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   And I'm trying to give you a sufficient summary of the book to encourage you to read it,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   but I'm going to read enough of the passages here from the first two chapters and from the last chapter to give you a good overview.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   If you're interested in the meat and potatoes, go back and read through the actual history of each of the major retirement programs that's listed here.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   So we begin with Chapter 1, and I particularly like the author's introduction here.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   And this section to give interest is entitled "Americans Confront Retirement, the Osler Valedictory."
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   And this is a famous speech that was mentioned in several of those articles that I read yesterday.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   So we will begin here.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   "William Osler was reluctant to leave Johns Hopkins, even to return to British soils as Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   His 16 years in Baltimore as physician-in-chief of the university's new hospital had been triumphant ones,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   full of rewards commensurate with his growing stature as teacher, medical scholar, administrator, and man of letters.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   On February 22, 1905, Osler delivered a valedictory address, which he titled "The Fixed Period," after a novel by Anthony Trollope.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   Grateful for his contributions to the medical school, and aware of Osler's reputation as a public speaker, the audience was large and receptive.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   A serious and ingenious man, Osler took this opportunity to instruct, drawing a series of analogies between his own physical state and the human body on the one hand,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   and the health of the teaching and medical professions on the other.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   Although Osler's career was to last another 14 years, the address had a "retrospective" quality,
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   as Osler, extrapolating from his own history, discussed the universals of hard work, flagging energies, and the need for increased leisure.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   But his departure was more than the product of his own physical demands.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   "It may be asked, in the first place," he continued, "whether metabolism is sufficiently active in the professoriate body.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   Is there change enough? Would not the loss of a professor bring stimulating benefits to a university?
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   It is strange of how slight value is the unit in the great system. A mobile professoriate," he argued, "was essential.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   Change is the very marrow of a professor's existence. A new set of students every year, a new set of assistants,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   a new set of associates every few years, to replace those called off to other fields.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   In any active department, there is no constancy, no stability in the human surroundings."
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   Had Osler chosen to diffuse the valedictory at this point, he would have emerged relatively unscathed,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   having aroused, one would imagine, no small measure of anxiety on the part of the older members of the faculty,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   but avoiding public vilification. This was not Osler's way.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   Instead, the lecture, for that indeed was what it had become, moved from the general to the concrete,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   and from problem to solution, as Osler delivered the lines that were to have a considerable impact on his reputation,
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   and were to be associated with the eminent physician long after his death.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   I am going to be very bold and touch upon another question of some delicacy, but of infinite importance in university life,
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   one that has not been settled in this country. I refer to a fixed period for the teacher,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   either of time of service or of age. It is a very serious matter in our young universities
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   to have all of the professors growing old at the same time. In some places, only an epidemic,
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   a time limit, or an age limit can save the situation. I have two fixed ideas well known to my friends,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   harmless obsessions with which I sometimes bore them, but which have a direct bearing on this important problem.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   The first is the comparative uselessness of men above forty years of age.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   This may seem shocking, and yet, read aright, the world's history bears out the statement.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   Take the sum of human achievement in action, in science, in art, in literature.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   Subtract the work of the men above forty, and while we should miss great treasures,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   even priceless treasures, we would practically be where we are today.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   It is difficult to name a great and far-reaching conquest of the mind which has not been given to the world
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   by a man on whose back the sun was still shining. The effective, moving, vitalizing work of the world
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   is done between the ages of twenty-five and forty. These fifteen golden years of plenty,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   the anabolic or constructive period in which there is always a balance in the mental bank and the credit is still good.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   In the science and art of medicine, young or comparatively young men have made every advance of the first rank.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   My second fixed idea is the uselessness of men above sixty years of age,
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   and the incalculable benefit it would be in commercial, political, and in professional life
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   if, as a matter of course, men stopped work at this age. In that charming novel, The Fixed Period,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   Anthony Trollope discusses the practical advantages in modern life of a return to this ancient usage,
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   and the plot hinges upon the admirable scheme of a college into which, at sixty, men retired
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   for a year of contemplation before a peaceful departure by chloroform.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   That incalculable benefits might follow, such a scheme is apparent to anyone who, like myself,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   is nearing the limit and who has made a careful study of the calamities which may befall men
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   during the seventh and eighth decades. Still more, when he contemplates the many evils which they perpetuate
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   unconsciously and with impunity, one could, in short, tolerate the participation of the middle-aged,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   who were only uncreative. The aged, however, were positively dangerous. They must be retired.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   Graebener goes on and uses this as a hook to pull us in, and I'm going to be skipping around
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   reading just a couple of paragraphs here and there that I think will contribute.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   Osler's suggestion of retiring those over sixty provoked considerable comment, most of it negative.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   Before retirement could be carried out on a mass basis, said the Brooklyn Eagle,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   a major redistribution of wealth would be necessary. Otherwise, no one could afford it.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   At Harper's Weekly, editor George Harvey thought Osler's notions of the productivity of those
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   between twenty-five and forty scandalous, but found some logic in retirement.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   "The end of life," said Harvey, "could be a pleasure time in which adequate preparation
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   would be followed by a variety of frivolous and irresponsible, but ultimately satisfying activities.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   Resistance to such a concept," Harvey contended, "was deeply ingrained in the national character."
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   "We are like Rolo. Our play is work, and it continues to be work in the case of most of us,
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   just as long as our work is marketable."
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   In 1905, the idea of pulling back was at odds with both the level of opportunity in the society
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   and prevailing notions of work. The Saturday Review counseled resistance.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   "Men shrink from voluntarily committing themselves to an act which simulates the forced inactivity of death."
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   Thirty-five years later, with work increasingly scarce, especially for the old and middle-aged,
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   and pensions, public and private, more readily available, this conception of retirement
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   would fuse with Social Security and become a dominant ideology.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   A society so intensely concerned with progress must also be vigilant against sources of decay.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   At this time, the perceived menaces to progress were, first, trusts and monopolies,
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   which threatened to destroy opportunity and competition, the critical ingredients of capitalism,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   and, second, the new immigration, which would, many feared, corrupt the racial fiber
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   and invitiate national strength and purpose.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   Osler brought to the surface a third source of cultural anxiety,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   the specter of an aging population mired in its own demography.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Socialists would focus on this idea some 40 years later, and in the process,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   create the profession of social gerontology.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   Continuing on through a section of retirement and the evolution of American capitalism,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   we move to Chapter 2, which is entitled "Retirement and the Origins of Age Discrimination."
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   I'm going to read here a section on the problem of technology,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   and then also talk through how it was implemented and discussed in society.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   The Problem of Technology
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   Lee Welling Squire's Old Age Dependency in the United States, published in 1912, was an angry book.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   In it, Squire challenged the right of the individual employer to "engage men in an occupation
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   that exhausts the individual's industrial life in 10, 20, or 40 years,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   and then leave the remnant floating on society at large as a derelict at sea."
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   Squire implied that it was justifiable for an industry to wear out its workers.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Having done so, it must simply make provision for them, presumably through some form of retirement.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   But work was inherently consuming, damaging, and destructive,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   and that technology was the central agent in the work experience of middle-aged and older employees.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   By the late 1920s, technology was one of the most common explanations
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   of the employment problems of older workers.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   Herbert Hoover's Committee on Recent Economic Changes found the essence of the problem
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   in a new job mix that placed a premium on youthful vigor.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   "Labor-saving machinery," commented the Commercial and Financial Chronicle,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   "had displaced men and reduced opportunity.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   Even in the midst of the Great Depression, when one would expect such an analysis of unemployment
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   to have been overthrown by the sheer numbers of those without jobs and the collapse of the world economy,
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   the technological argument remained influential,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   prompting a 1936 investigation of unemployment and technology by the House of Representatives.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   By 1960, the centrality of technology had emerged as an article of faith among social gerontologists."
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   The only legitimate early study of the problem, by English economist William Beveridge in 1909,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   took a diametrically opposed point of view.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   Machinery, Beveridge said, did not cause unemployment,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   for if machinery had been making labor superfluous,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   the price of labor would have fallen with the advance of technology.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   In fact, the opposite had happened.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   Although Beveridge reduced unemployment to "specific imperfections of adjustment,"
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   including regular changes in industry, fluctuations in industrial activity,
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   and the need for reserves of labor to meet incidental fluctuations in trade,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   he was well aware that older workers were not absorbed as easily as younger workers.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   Since technology was not involved, the problem must reside in some characteristic of the older worker,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   which served to inhibit his employment.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   Older workers, Beveridge reasoned, lacked a quality essential in a rapidly changing society—adaptability.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   Beveridge had, in effect, reversed the technological argument,
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   moving from an inflexible technology to the inflexible worker.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   The printing industry offers some opportunity to test the technological theory in a historical context.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   I'm going to skip through a section here talking about the adjustments in the printing industry
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   with the introduction of a new machine called the Linotype,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   and continue on to the commentary on the impact of that machine on the printers themselves.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:23.200]   The Inland Printer, voice of the employers, was torn between what it saw as the absurdity of superannuation
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   in an industry in which brains, skill, and experience played such a major role in strength and endurance,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   such a minor one, and the inevitability and rationality of the whole process.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   The latter viewpoint was dominant.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   Acknowledging that labor had been intensified by the introduction of the new machines,
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   and that intensification was in some measure responsible for the problems of the older worker,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   owners located the source of this intensification in two factors.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   First, technology, which they labeled at once as benign and a mark of the "advance of civilization."
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   Second, the reduction in working hours, for which, of course, the workers were responsible.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   Technology produced superannuated workers because "the daily task is more exacting."
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   Shop owners had also developed a more tractable labor force.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   The "old-time prints" were irrepressible drinkers who might at any moment quit work
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   and leave the shop for the companionship of the saloon.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   The sober, well-educated, and quick-witted young men who replaced them had lost the drinking habit.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   The victims of this reorganization shared with the owners a sense of the inevitability of what was happening to them,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   but their resignation emerged from an analysis of capitalist modes of production rather than technology itself.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:52.200]   They understood that not the machine, but the demands placed on its operator by the shop owner, were behind the grind.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   The old boy has to undergo today in order to hold his job.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   Although printers agreed that good eyesight and supple fingers were requisites of linotype operation,
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   they would not accept the master's argument that the mere operation of typesetting machines
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   damaged the nervous systems and general health of the worker.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.200]   "It was," wrote one typesetter, "the unnatural pace that kills."
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Employees did, however, acknowledge the claim of their employers that the capital requirements imposed on the industry
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   by typesetting machinery entailed certain operating requirements.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   A $3,500 piece of machinery, the Mergenthaler, had to be operated efficiently, extensively, and intensively to be economical.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   Continuing on, imperatives of the workday.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   Technological imperatives and labor force modifications are part of an answer to the conundrum of age discrimination.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   But why the speed-up?
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   Why, in the last years of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th,
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   were American employers so interested in squeezing the most from their labor?
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   Behind the speed-up was a set of interrelationships that revolved around the shorter working day.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   Historians who have studied the politics of the working day have centered their inquiries on the Haymarket Riot of 1886
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   and questions of social order.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   For most employers and workers, however, the shorter working day was important, largely for its economic implications.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   The modern phase of the agitation for a shorter working day began in 1886,
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   when the 10-hour day and the six-day week were the common experience of American labor.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   A national strike in that year failed, but agitation continued, pushed by national unions.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   In the printing industry, working day politics had their beginnings in 1887,
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   and within four years, the International Typographical Union, ITU,
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   had secured agreements covering limited numbers of the nation's newspaper workers.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   At the 1898 Syracuse Conference, representatives of management and labor
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   agreed to extend the nine-and-a-half-hour day to most of the industry as of November 21, 1898,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   and the nine-hour day a year later.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   Through a strike initiated in 1905, the ITU and its companion unions reduced the working day to eight hours
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   in some areas of the industry.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   Aggregate data for other industries indicates that the printing experience was typical.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   Nationally, the decline in the working day was gradual from 1892 through about 1915.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   For 11 selected industries, a major decline of 0.6% occurred in 1892-93,
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   and another of 0.9% in 1901-02.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   In presenting its case for the shorter working day, labor offered a number of rationales.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   Shorter hours would mean more time for recreation, leisure, and education,
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   as well as less toil before the machine.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   For the most part, however, these considerations were peripheral.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   The shorter working day was a work-sharing program that the printers, capital and labor,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   believed would help solve the threatening problem of technologically-induced unemployment.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   This analysis was shared at least by cigar makers, painters, engineers, blacksmiths,
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   machinists, iron molders, and silk weavers.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   Work-sharing was a goal of the major unions of typesetters and printing pressmen in 1898.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.200]   In Dayton and New York City, for example, machinery installation had left a surplus of printers,
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   and union officials expected the shorter work day to at least contribute to their re-employment.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   Labor organizations were seeking to aid their unemployed, presumably an older group,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   through the mechanism of the shorter working day.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   There is also some evidence that particular groups of workers sought to share directly
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.200]   and personally in the productivity of labor-saving machinery.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   This was especially likely to occur in occupations, such as newspaper typesetting,
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   where work was naturally concentrated in one period of the day.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   In this situation, compositors argued, a longer working day would only mean additional hours of idleness.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   No matter how benign the intent of labor organizations,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   the major impact of the shorter working day was to intensify the pressures on older workers.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   Skipping through to a section entitled "Economic Rationale."
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   During the late 19th century, economists labored to develop a theoretical framework
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   that would tie the seemingly harmful industrial realities of the shorter working day
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   and higher wages to the desirable goal of increased productivity.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.200]   Where capitalism had experienced these phenomena at an early date, as in England and Germany,
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   the economic rationale was most developed.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   Gerhard von Schulz-Gabernitz used the classic case of the English cotton textile industry
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   as evidence that high wages and falling work hours could be reconciled with productivity
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   through the mechanism of age discrimination.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   In an 1871 work on factory legislation,
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   Ernest von Plainer, for the first time, raised the issue of the age of the workforce.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   Following the introduction of shorter hours, he wrote, "The operatives, especially the younger ones,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:08.200]   no longer exhausted by excessive bodily effort, produced the same amount
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   and frequently even turned out more in the shorter time,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   having, owing to the almost universal system of payment by the piece, a special interest in doing so."
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   Skipping down, more than any other single work published in the late 19th century,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   Brentano's "Hours and Wages" provided the capitalist class with a powerful rationale
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   for eliminating older workers who were inefficient and tradition-bound
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   and for hiring younger workers with more muscle, more energy, and fewer ties to the past.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   Several American economists contributed to this flowering ideology.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   Three years into the severe depression of the 1870s,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   Francis Walker suggested relieving the pressure on labor markets through legislation,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   prohibiting labor for all classes beyond the term which physiological science accepts
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   as consistent with soundness and vigor.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   An interest in productivity rather than unemployment informed
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   Jacob Schoenhoff's "Economy of High Wages" published in 1892.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   A laissez-faire economist and low-tariff democrat,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   Schoenhoff traveled the world for the Department of State,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   comparing wage rates and productivity and concluding that productivity increases
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   depended upon rising living standards.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   As an example of the relationship between low wages and low productivity,
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   Schoenhoff pointed to the English nail industry where old and young,
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   husbands and wives and daughters all work at nail-making
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   from four or five in the morning until late at night.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   An economy that offered labor to inefficient workers was not functioning properly.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   It remained only for the theory to be incorporated into the mainstream of American economics.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   That task fell to Alfred Marshall, dean of turn-of-the-century economists
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   and author of a number of popular textbooks.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   In "Principles of Economics," Marshall, with Auslerian detachment,
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   tied elemental physical characteristics to profit.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   Health and strength were the basis of industrial efficiency.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   "In estimating muscular strength, or indeed any other kind of strength,
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   for industrial purposes, we must take into account the number of hours in the day,
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   the number of days in the year, and the number of years in a lifetime
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   during which it can be asserted."
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Discussing Marshall's physical emphasis in an article written in 1906,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   well-known statistician Frederick Hoffman concluded that for the nation
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   to maximize its productive potential, given the present capacities of its population,
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   work should normally begin at age 15 and cease at 65.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   Economic theory was linked to the workplace in an alliance detrimental
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   to older workers and mandating retirement.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   Support from science and medicine.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   Science came to the support of capitalist economics
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   in late 19th century studies of work and fatigue.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   Prevailing theories originated in the work of George Beard,
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   a physician who, in the 1870s, popularized the idea of neurasthenia,
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.200]   a catch-all illness with an endless list of symptoms, including anxiety and fatigue.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   The disease was hereditary and cumulative.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   "No two persons," writes historian Charles Rosenberg,
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   "would be born with the same amount of nervous force.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   No two persons would be subjected to the same external pressures.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   Only those individuals whose endowment of nervous force
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   was inadequate to the demands of daily life succumbed to neurasthenia."
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   The closer one's contact with the new technology of the 19th century,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.200]   the steam engine, the linotype, the sewing machine, even the telegraph,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   the faster one's supply of nervous force would be consumed,
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   and therefore, to be replenished.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   Work became associated with nervous strain, tension, anxiety, stress, and nerves.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   Workers were burned out, used up, exhausted, and prematurely aged.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   During debates over retirement legislation,
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   each occupation, from railroading to teaching to mail delivery,
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   would claim to be the most tension-producing and energy-consuming.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   In a 2012 study of old-age dependency,
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   Squeer opened a chapter on transportation
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   with a description that might well have been written by Beard.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   "There is no part of the great national labor machine
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   that wears out men more rapidly or subjects them to greater hazard
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   than that which we call transportation.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   Especially is this true of those engaged in the operation of trains
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   and vessels on time schedules,
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   which require by day and night the strictest attention to duty and rules.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   Every moment is fraught with danger.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   Brain, nerve, and muscle are all subject to the severest and most unexpected strain.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   The locomotive engines are of the most intricate device
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   and require the keenest intelligence, quickest action,
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   and oftentimes the most prolonged tension of mind and body."
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   During their campaign for pensions,
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   the public school teachers argued a similar case.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   "The severe mental strain and high nervous tension
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   under which faithful teachers work
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.200]   tend to make them apprehensive of the future.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   Small and insufficient salaries preclude those frequent and necessary relaxations
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   which preserve health and elasticity of mind and body.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   Work itself rarely kills, but worry often does."
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   Even bureaucracies not involved in the competitive economy
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   shared this concept of work.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   Writing to Pierre S. DuPont in an attempt to recruit youthful members
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   for his National Civic Federation,
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   John Hayes Hammond explained his inquiry
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   with reference to the "high tension and complexities
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   of our 20th century civilization."
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   The import of such statements is independent of their scientific validity.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   In their various forms, these work-related ideas
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   encouraged employers in their proclivity to select younger workers
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   whose contact with the technological sources of nervous tension
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   had heretofore been limited.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   They led logically to the notion of a "work life"
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   which naturally ended well before death, perhaps even in middle age,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   and they defined the older worker
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   as one who had used up a considerable portion of his allotted nervous force.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   I'm going to read one additional section here
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   that continues in this theme,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   and then we're going to skip through to some conclusions.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   This is from the section entitled
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   "Link to the Workplace, Scientific Management."
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   For anybody who's studied business,
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   you'll know that the scientific management movement
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   was an extremely important movement in modern corporate life.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   I'm just going to read two quick paragraphs here.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   The idea of scientific management, if you're not familiar,
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   is essentially, in my words,
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   the idea of measuring each and everything that would be done.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   It started with time and motion studies for workers
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   and basically trying to apply the scientific method
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   to the management of people.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   Really great in some areas, and then had, as anything,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   unintended consequences in many other things.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   "Scientific management demanded more of its workers
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   than a heightened level of intensity.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   It also required a certain kind of flexibility.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   If not exactly scientists, these managers and those to follow
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   were experimenters, with the factory as their laboratory.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   Labor must be willing to cooperate,
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   first in the process of experimentation,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   then in a reconstruction of its work habits.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   In the early 19th century,
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   capitalists staffed their factories with children,
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   in part because, as Englishman Andrew Ure wrote,
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   "It is found nearly impossible
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   to convert persons past the age of puberty,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   whether drawn from rural or from handicraft occupations,
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   into useful factory hands.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   After struggling for a while to conquer their listless
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   or restive habits,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   they either renounce the employment spontaneously
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   or are dismissed by the overlookers
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   on account of inattention."
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   A similar obstacle confronted the aggressive management movement
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   and, to a lesser extent,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   most late 19th and 20th century capitalists.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   They used the same solution as their predecessors,
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:06.200]   recruit a young, flexible labor force,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.200]   willing to play the guinea pig,
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.200]   unfettered by craft traditions
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   and dysfunctional work routines.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   William Osler would have applauded the virtual unanimity
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   with which older workers were labeled "unadaptable."
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   An industrial psychiatrist
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   wrote of five kinds of employee crises.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   The fifth was the crisis of the older employee.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   "He is a touchy individual,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   and criticism of his actions
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   is always hampered by the very human warmth and respect
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   his long record generates.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   Yet it is true that to grow old gracefully
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   is a very difficult art.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   Time does indeed march on.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   Old ways give place to new,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   and the old employees cling to their time-worn ways,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   suspicious of the young men and their newfangled methods."
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   Paul Cherrington,
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   professor of marketing at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   argued that American business
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   was being strangled by a surfeit of old men and young men's jobs.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   "The approach of middle age," Cherrington said,
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   "could be observed in the appearance of such qualities
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   as lack of adaptability,
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   devotion to routine,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   reluctance to adventure,
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   chronic impatience, and rigidity."
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   Now I'm going to read one summary
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   from the end of this chapter two,
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   and then we're going to go to the end of the book
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   and talk about solutions and observations.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   Summary.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   "The battle for reform, as it was first joined in the late 1920s,
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   was not so much a real contest,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   with the outcome in doubt, as a ritual struggle,
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:56.200]   with both sides aware of the identity of the ultimate victor.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   It could be no other way.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   The solutions that might have made a difference
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   and made the conflict real--
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   massive job creation,
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   a willingness to continue production with older forms of technology,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   a reduction in the operating speed of the technology--
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   were not considered viable options.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   As William Osler had so clearly seen,
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   a society that is dedicated to progress
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   and allows its economic institutions to define its terms
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   must learn to sacrifice the older generation for the younger.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   Retirement and age discrimination
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   emerged as important phenomena at the same time,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   and not coincidentally.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   Retirement was one of several means available
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.200]   to a business culture committed to restructuring
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   the age components of the workforce.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   Workers might be fired outright, of course,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   but, as later chapters indicate,
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   such a policy was difficult for most public and private employers
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.200]   to carry out.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   Retirement was impersonal and egalitarian in its application.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   It allowed the powerful turn-of-the-century impulse
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   toward efficiency to coexist with a system
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   of labor-management relations
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   that was still permeated with personal and human relationships.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   After 1915, a minority of employers found older workers attractive.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.200]   Overall, however, discrimination did not diminish.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   Most employers continued to favor younger workers,
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.200]   and after 1925, retirement came to be seen
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   as a realistic antidote to unemployment
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   in depressed industries and in the economy at large.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   There are, between here and the end of the book,
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   a number of important chapters,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   and clearly I can't create an audiobook out of this.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   A, you're probably not ready for that,
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   and B, it would be illegal.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   But it talks about efficiency, security, community,
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   retirement in the federal civil service.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   It goes on, there's chapters on retirement and education.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   It goes on with retirement and the reconstruction of community,
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   railroad workers and the New Deal,
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   Social Security and the older worker,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   the triumph of retirement, the post-war years,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   the reconsideration of retirement in the 1970s,
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   and then we come to the final chapter,
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   the meaning and function of retirement.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   I would encourage reading those intervening chapters
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   if you're interested in the book,
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   but I'm going to read now the summary, the final chapter,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   the meaning and function of retirement,
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.200]   and then we'll discuss some of the impact and commentary
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   and comments as far as what I see as some ideas
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   for how to integrate this history.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   Chapter 10, the meaning and function of retirement.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   Retirement has had no single function in American history.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   From its beginnings in the private and public bureaucracies
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   of the late 19th century, formal retirement has been a product
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   of its appeal to institutions and social groups
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.200]   with disparate goals and viewpoints.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   Until 1930, economy, efficiency, modernization
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   and depersonalization were the most important uses of retirement.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   Since then, personal security and social welfare
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   have so dominated our conception of the function
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   of private and governmental retirement systems
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   that we have forgotten retirement's origins
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   in the economic and social milieu of the turn of the century.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   Having adopted this generic definition of social security,
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.200]   the ideology of the welfare state,
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   we have become incapable of understanding
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   the history of retirement and its place in our culture.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   Retirement goals cut across the boundaries
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   that presumably divided labor from management,
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.200]   the public from the private sector.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   Specific needs might vary, but leaders in education,
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   government, business, and the trade unions
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   found common ground in the pension
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   as an institution of control.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.200]   Henry Pritchett's intent to use the Carnegie Foundation
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   for the Advancement of Teaching
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   as a mechanism for restructuring and shaping higher education
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   had its parallels not only in the public schools,
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   where retirement was supposed to help maintain
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   the teaching profession as a source of social stability,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   but in the trade unions and corporations,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   where pensions were expected to bind workers
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   to one or the other of these institutions,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   and in the federal bureaucracy,
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   where the potential for dominance inherent in the pension
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   was of concern to labor leaders.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   Because the pension could be used effectively
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   to control dissidents,
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.200]   many workers came to favor contributory systems.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   While the Social Security Act of 1935
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   has been criticized for its contributory feature,
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   the semi-contractual nature of the contribution
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   has appealed to some employees for the freedom it implies.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   Moreover, the location of the system
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   within the national government,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   rather than within the private sector,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   promised relief from the sporadic attempts of business,
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   most common in railroading,
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   to use pension systems to manipulate employees.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   Retirement was also expected to induce progress
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   and prevent social retrogression.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   This viewpoint was shared by Pritchett,
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   William Osler,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.200]   and a generation of high-level government officials,
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   of whom the pension bureau's Gaylord Seltzgeber
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   was a prototype,
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   who were among the first to confront
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   the potential of the debilitating effects
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   of burgeoning bureaucracy.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   Pensions also fulfilled a variety of microeconomic ends.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   Depending on the nature of the bureaucracy
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   and its particular needs,
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   retirement has made it impossible for institutions
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   to replace inefficient older workers with younger ones
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   and expensive salaried personnel with cheaper ones.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   The public schools and the railroads did so in the 1930s.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   It has allowed institutions to defer wage increases
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   and, in times of inflation,
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   to lower salaries through deferral.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   Turnover reduction was a major goal of pension systems
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   between 1910 and 1930,
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   while recruitment of superior personnel
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   was of lesser importance.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   Pensions have also met the need,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   common in all bureaucracies,
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   but of special significance in declining industries
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   and in periods of high unemployment,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   to maintain and provide promotional opportunity,
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   the illusion, if not the reality,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   of personal progress and achievement.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   Where retirement systems did not exist,
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   as in the sales profession in the 1920s,
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   age discrimination served many of the same functions.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   The post-1940 growth in pension plans
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   was a product of changes in collective bargaining
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   after 1949 and of the tax advantages available
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   under World War II regulations and legislation.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   Unions found that pensions satisfied their members
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   in difficult times and opened up jobs
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   in crowded industries and during recessions.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   Business still expected retirement systems
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   to improve efficiency by making employees more secure
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   and by facilitating dismissal.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.200]   But as industrial relations became more sophisticated
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   after 1930,
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   corporations turned to other mechanisms of efficiency,
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   control, and adjustment,
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   and ceased to demand so many internal benefits
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   from the pension.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   Retirement also emerged from, and was a reaction to,
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   the changing tone of employer-employee relationships.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   It was, first, an attack on the systems of permanence
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   that employees had attempted to build
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   into bureaucratic structures.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.200]   These systems included tenure in teaching,
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   seniority on the railroads,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   and the elimination of the spoils system in the civil service.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   As workers sought to establish a property right to the job,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.200]   managers, often joined by workers,
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   turned to retirement as one of several mechanisms
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.200]   for diminishing the impact of that right.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   When the property right was allowed to exist
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.200]   for a decade or more
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   and to become a part of employee expectations,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   a challenge to it could produce the high level
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   of emotionally charged conflict experienced in Chicago
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   over the relationship between tenure and retirement.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   And in Washington, D.C., over general job security.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   In some sense, these contests pitted
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   one impersonal bureaucratic mechanism against another.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   Second, retirement was a reaction
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   against the continued influence
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   of personal modes of behavior in institutions,
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   in which personal relationships were increasingly seen
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   as dysfunctional relics of the past.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   To a certain extent,
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   the application of personal qualities to business affairs
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   is inherently dysfunctional by capitalist definitions.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Employment practices should reflect economic rationality,
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   rather than priorities established by family and friendship.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   Yet in 1890, in spite of mechanization
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.200]   and the rise of national competition,
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   employment practices had not been fully rationalized.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.200]   The economic and technological forces
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   that made age discrimination a significant phenomenon
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   in the late 19th century
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   had not resulted in the complete elimination
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   of protective attitudes toward older workers.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.200]   Corporations might seldom hire older workers,
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   but they also seldom fired them.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.200]   Some notion of personal or social responsibility remained.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.200]   One can see it manifested at DuPont,
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   within the aging railroad workforce,
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   and in the civil service and teaching bureaucracies,
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   where the inability to discharge aged employees
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   coexisted uneasily with the new codes of efficiency.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   Public and private bureaucracies
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   had become old-age institutions,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   providing the money, status, and physical activity
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   that would be dispensed a half-century later
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.200]   through social security programs,
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   nursing homes, and old-age clubs and centers.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   Whether we choose to regard those workers
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   who lived under the system as employed or retired,
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   informally pensioned, as contemporaries said,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   depends only on how one uses the words.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   It is more important to understand
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.200]   that work-centered retirement was a natural phenomenon
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   in cities as well as rural areas
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   and in large and complex bureaucracies
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.200]   as well as small firms.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   Many of the dislocating effects of mid-century retirement
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   are not so much caused by retirement itself
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   as by the destruction of an earlier version of retirement
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   more suited to human needs for structure, sociability, and place.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   The agent of this destruction was formal retirement itself.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   One of its tangible manifestations was the old-age home.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   Because it often separated the old from their families
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   and geographical communities,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   the old-age home was an especially disruptive institution.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   Workers rejected it,
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   even when it offered retirement with fellow craftsmen.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   Depersonalization was neither easily nor completely accomplished.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   At least within the public sphere,
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   the existence of a formal pension system
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   did not guarantee a purely rational approach to employee relations.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   Pensions under the Civil Service Retirement Act of 1920
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   were not sufficient to overcome knowledge
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   that employment officers continued to have
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   of the personal details of employees' lives.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.200]   Bureau chiefs preferred to give extensions
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   rather than discharge a clerk
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   whose pension would not cover mortgage payments
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   or decently provide for his family.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   Chicago school administrators eventually supported mandatory retirement
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.200]   when a voluntary system failed to induce retirement among teachers over 70.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   But even then, several school board members felt uncomfortable
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   with the notion of subjecting faithful employees to an arbitrary system.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   Private sector data is more difficult to obtain,
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   but if DuPont's experience is typical,
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   a formal corporate pension plan was no guarantee of impersonality.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   The relatively late development of mandatory retirement
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   in the post-World War II period,
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   following a half-century of experience with voluntary arrangements,
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.200]   suggests that mandatory systems were installed
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   when voluntary ones failed to induce retirement at desired ages.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   Third, retirement has historically been sanctioned
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   as a form of unemployment relief.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   Older workers have been retired to create places for younger ones.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   This has been done most blatantly and most publicly in railroading,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   an industry of declining employment since 1920.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   But the same solution has been applied to other occupations,
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   like typesetting, which were experiencing technological unemployment
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   or technologically induced superannuation,
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.200]   a specific variety of the same phenomenon.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   The shorter workday and the shorter work life
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   shared this unemployment relief function.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   Particular elements of the federal bureaucracy--
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   Navy, Yard, and Post Office employees in the 1920s, for example--
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   advocated additional inducements to retirement
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   and disarmament and technology, respectively, threatened job security.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.200]   With the additional stimulus of the Depression,
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   retirement as work sharing became a popular solution
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.200]   to national unemployment.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.200]   It was put into practice with administrative changes
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   in the application of civil service retirement
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   through the Railroad Retirement Act
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   and in a necessarily limited form,
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   given the resources available to the national government,
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   in the Social Security Act of 1935.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   Retirement as a method of alleviating unemployment
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   has been carried out with the support of the aged.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   One of the most impressive aspects of the Townsend movement
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   is the self-sacrifice of the old in the interest of jobs for the young.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   But this should not obscure the discrimination implicit in the mechanism
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.200]   or the felt need for such discrimination as a device for social order.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   When jobs were scarce in the 1930s,
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   the Roosevelts, Eleanor and Franklin,
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   ministered, relatively at least, to the needs of youth.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   It was the young who threatened disorder and violence
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   and whose political sympathies seemed most crucial.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   Sharing this perspective, the aged welcomed their own retirement
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   and missed an opportunity to insist on the right to work, regardless of age.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   With the exception of the military pension,
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   19th century retirement was carried out by cities and states,
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   trade unions and corporations.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   Following a dramatic and frightening expansion
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   in the bureaucracy of the nation-state in the Progressive period,
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:41.200]   the national government again asserted its preferences for youth and efficiency
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:45.200]   by creating a retirement system for its own civil service employees.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   During the Depression, the magic of retirement was applied
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   to the sick industry of railroading, using the mechanism of federal law.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   And in 1935, when Congress passed the Social Security Act,
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.200]   the national government affirmed the importance of retirement
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   for much of the American population.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   Private pensions came under the direct supervision of the national government
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   in legislation passed in 1947, 1958 and 1974.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   The Retirement Act of 1978 represents an attempt to roll back
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   what was now seen as a very expensive, complex
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   and inefficient instrument of public policy.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   The emergence of the national government as the foremost arbiter of retirement
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.200]   parallels the largest history of government intervention in the economy.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   It also reflects the tendency since 1920 to conceive of the economy
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   in national terms and to view retirement as an important ingredient
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   in the broader macroeconomic picture.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:44.200]   Retirement could become an instrument of national economic policy in the 1930s
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:48.200]   only if millions of workers could be reached by federal law.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   Pension plans could prove a useful source of capital for business
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   only if their use could be nationally restricted under Taft-Hartley and ERISA.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   Retirement could be utilized in the struggle to arrest the long-term decline
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   in the American economy only if the rollback took place nationally.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   Older workers have generally welcomed the pension plan,
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   if not mandatory retirement or the idea of retirement itself.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   The active core of the Townsend movement was composed of persons over 60,
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   working and retired.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.200]   The Railway Employees National Pension Association,
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.200]   the equivalent of the Townsend organization on an industry level,
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.200]   was also buoyed by the enthusiasm of older workers.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   Teachers and civil service pensions went unopposed by any large segment
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   of employees in either occupation.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   Organizations of the retired, from the National Association of Retired Federal Employees
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.200]   to the more broadly based organizations of the 1950s,
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   such as the American Association of Retired Persons,
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   have adopted a restricted attitude toward retirement.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.200]   Just as most American unions have concentrated on wages
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.200]   and generally avoided workplace issues,
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   so have the retirement associations emphasized benefits
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.200]   and accepted the necessity of retirement, the absence of work.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   Retirement proved only mildly divisive as an issue among teachers,
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.200]   more so among railroad workers.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   As a group, the young were seldom as committed to retirement,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   especially to voluntary programs that reduced job creation potential,
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   as were older workers.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   Employed workers tended to be wage-minded rather than retirement-minded,
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   unless they were close enough to the end of their work lives
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   to appreciate the prospect of a pension.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   If the railroad experience in the 1930s is typical,
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   a substantial majority of older workers supported retirement
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   amid the objections of a vocal minority who wished to continue working.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.200]   Data from the 1950s indicates that once the extreme insecurity
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   of the Depression decade disappeared,
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   the desire to remain at work became more widespread.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   This revival of interest in work helped make the selling of retirement
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   a necessity for corporations and labor unions.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   In almost every industry and in every period after 1890,
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.200]   the middle-aged found retirement systems frustrating and ineffective.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.200]   Too old to find work, too young to retire,
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.200]   the middle-aged worker of 55, 50, or even 45,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   was a constant embarrassment to the American economic and political system.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   By 1900, a 60-year-old typesetter was considered superannuated,
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   too old to operate the new technology.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.200]   Yet he was also too old to retrain and too young for the union to retire.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.200]   Thousands of railroad workers experienced the same anomalous circumstances.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   The Social Security Act of 1935 offered no old-age benefits
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   to the worker under 65,
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.200]   no matter how long he or she had been unemployed.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.200]   Congress ignored the determined efforts of Francis Townsend
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   and Ernest Lundin to serve this middle-aged constituency.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.200]   In the 1950s, the middle-aged were reduced to writing bitter letters
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   to Dwight Eisenhower and his cabinet officials,
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   who refused to recognize the obvious.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   Retirement, permanent unemployment insurance,
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   rather than unemployment insurance,
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.200]   was the only appropriate device for dealing with the social problems
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.200]   of the long-term unemployed middle-aged worker.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   Although retirement was essentially a political device
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   imposed by one group upon another,
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   its imposition was seldom challenged.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   Why have American workers welcomed or acquiesced in retirement?
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   Anxiety about social disorder, which the old associated with youth,
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.200]   provides part of an explanation
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.200]   and one of particular relevance for the critical decade of the 1930s.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   On another level, it is possible to see the aged,
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.200]   indeed the majority of the population,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   as victims of a 20th-century redefinition of retirement.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.200]   To some extent, this redefinition was a product of a natural inclination
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   to accept the pension as a bounty, gift, or necessary financial reward.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.200]   Even in 1900, during the early struggles over teachers
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   and civil service pensions,
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   the alternative to the pension was no pension.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   The alternative to leaving work with this protection
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   was not remaining at work, but rather leaving work unprotected.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   Retirement on pension also appeared reasonable
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.200]   to the machinists, printers, trainmen, and other workers
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.200]   for whom the alternative was the social isolation
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   of institutionalization in an old-age home.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   Because employees needed the basic forms of security
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   the pension could provide,
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   and because this security component could not be isolated
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.200]   from the pension's efficiency and control aspects,
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   retirement was never completely divorced from a notion of security,
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   however defensive.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.200]   The view of retirement as a separate period of time
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   in which one reaps the rewards of past service
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.200]   has always been a part of the conceptualization of the institution,
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.200]   but its salience, among other definitions of retirement,
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   began in the 1920s with the arguments of leisure theorists
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   that technological unemployment could be,
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   and indeed had to be, converted into leisure.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   Retirement was the inevitable result of the need
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   to shorten the work life to spread available work.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   Although forced withdrawal from the workplace
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   might have been interpreted negatively,
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   leisure theorists chose to emphasize technology's potential
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   for freeing Americans for new forms of leisure.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.200]   At the same time, business made retirement and security
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   difficult to separate.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.200]   Under the influence of Elton Mayo
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.200]   and other practitioners of industrial psychology,
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   employee performance and security became closely linked,
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.200]   and the corporate world thus had a strong incentive
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.200]   to define retirement as a state of security.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   The massive insecurity of the Great Depression
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.200]   further obscured the historical origins of retirement.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.200]   The development of old age security
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.200]   during a time of insecurity and dependency
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.200]   has made it difficult to see that some of the roots of social security
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.200]   were in retirement,
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   rather than retirement having its origins in social security.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   A complex program serving a number of social and economic functions,
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   social security took on a singleness of purpose
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   and a simplicity that its authors never intended,
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   and that has never been descriptive of reality.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.200]   Even the Railroad Retirement Act,
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.200]   so clearly drawn as a retirement measure
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.200]   to achieve efficiency, economy, and unemployment relief,
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   was not impervious to the ideology of security.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200]   In striking down the original legislation,
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   the Supreme Court refused to accept
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.200]   the acknowledged purposes of the legislation
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   as appropriate or operative,
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   thus forcing retirement advocates
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   into legal defenses based on security.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   Acceptance and enjoyment of the new leisure
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   and of retirement itself required a definition of old age
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   that minimized the need for the high levels of activity
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   provided by the workplace.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   Disengagement theory served that purpose.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.200]   Disengagement became an important way
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.200]   of conceptualizing aging and retirement
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200]   in the decades after the 1950s.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.200]   Golden age clubs, developed in Cleveland in 1940
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   and widespread by 1950,
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   provided a different kind of adjustment mechanism,
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   one which combined disengagement with activity theory.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   The clubs were premised on disengagement theory
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   in the sense that traditional work was not considered essential
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   to a healthy existence.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   They relied on activity theory, however,
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   to the extent that their sponsors believed
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   that complete disengagement
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   was socially and individually destructive.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.200]   Whether complete or partial, however,
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.200]   disengagement theory justified withdrawal from work
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.200]   and contributed materially to the creation
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   of the mythology of retirement.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   Another link in the selling of retirement
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   was forged in the late 1940s
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.200]   when insurance companies joined industry and labor
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.200]   in making retirement into a commodity.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   By 1960, therefore,
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.200]   the meaning of retirement had been transformed.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   It was now a form of leisure,
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   a way of spending time following the conclusion of one's work life.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200]   It was a stage of existence,
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   inevitable but to be welcomed and even celebrated.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   Once largely a device for maximizing productivity
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200]   in a bureaucratizing society,
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   retirement had become a state of being,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.200]   apparently benign, classless, and apolitical.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.200]   The almost universal adulation
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   that has accompanied the reconsideration of retirement in the 1970s
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.200]   has further undermined our ability to understand it
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   as an ingredient in the national political economy.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.200]   Because the retirement legislation of 1978
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200]   was popular with liberal politicians,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   with labor unions,
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   and with virtually every organization
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   representing the old and retired,
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.200]   we have all too easily interpreted the law
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.200]   as a just, if belated, victory
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.200]   for those who want to work
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   over those who would prevent them from doing so
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   on the artificial basis of age.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   This view of the legislation is both incomplete and flawed.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   It is incomplete in that it fails to take into account
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   the costs that attend the elimination of mandatory retirement.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   Employees who remain at work
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   occupy jobs that would be filled by others.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   In effect, the burden of unemployment has shifted
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   from the retired to some other segment of the workforce.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.200]   If the labor market impact of the law
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   is not expected to be very large,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   some 200,000-ish jobs,
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.200]   neither will the retirement impact be substantial.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   To the extent that the legislation works,
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   it has no negative effects.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.200]   To the extent that it fails to keep potential retirees on the job,
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.200]   it has no such impact.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.200]   But then, neither is it a law worth celebrating
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.200]   as the elderly's Magna Carta.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.200]   The liberal view of the reconsideration of retirement is flawed
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   because it confuses result and purpose.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.200]   Although the new retirement law might well result
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200]   in older workers enjoying a longer work life,
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.200]   this was not its sole purpose,
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.200]   nor even its most important one.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.200]   The act became a possibility
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.200]   only in the context of challenges to American economic hegemony,
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.200]   and only when influential elements within American capitalism
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.200]   had concluded that retirement, as then constituted,
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.200]   was unduly costly as well as inefficient in allocating labor.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.200]   Once these conditions and perceptions existed,
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.200]   liberal reformers could have their way.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   Given the American experience with retirement over the last century,
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.200]   one could hardly have expected anything else.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.200]   Interesting, huh?
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   I've got to look up that word--hegemony.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   Leadership or dominance,
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.200]   especially by one country or social group over others.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.200]   Okay, so I wasn't familiar with that word.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.200]   Kind of adjusts your perspective, doesn't it?
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   It changes things.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   As with almost anything,
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   your preconceived ideas about something
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   will affect how you perceive the reality of the situation.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   The example that I heard--
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.200]   I don't know where it's from or I would cite it--
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.200]   has to do with how you perceive people.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.200]   For example, if I'm introducing you to my friend John,
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.200]   and I tell you John is just a wonderful human being.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200]   He's salt of the earth.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.200]   He's just the most kind, gentle, gracious,
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   just wonderful, genuine, caring, loving person
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   you're ever going to meet.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.200]   And you meet John, and when you meet him,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200]   he's a little bit snappy and a little bit short
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.200]   and a little bit rude to you.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   You automatically discount that and say,
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.200]   "Man, John must be having a bad day.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.200]   "He must have just gotten some bad news
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.200]   "or something must be happening to him."
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   But on the other side, if I tell you,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.200]   "I'm going to introduce you to my friend John,
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   "but listen, you've got to be careful.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   "He's not a real bad guy, but he's a little slimy.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.200]   "You've just got to be careful, because sometimes--
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   "Be careful."
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.200]   If that's all I tell you, and you meet John,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   and John is warm and genuine
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.200]   and just gracious and kind to you,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.200]   immediately your defenses go up.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   And you immediately say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   "Hang on a second, hang on a second.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   "What is John after here?"
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.200]   So I think the same thing with just about any topic.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.200]   If you go into--
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   Well, let's just stick with retirement.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.200]   If we go into retirement and say,
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   "Retirement is my right.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.200]   "Retirement is my reward."
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   You know, being able to retire and be at leisure
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.200]   for 30 years and to play and to fish and golf
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.200]   and do these things every single day,
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   if this is my right and my reward,
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   then it substantially impacts our experience of retirement.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.200]   If, on the other hand, we see retirement,
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   as is kind of sketched out in this book,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   as in some ways a punishment,
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.200]   or in some ways a...
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.200]   a punishment, I guess would be the best way,
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.200]   or as a political tool would be another accurate way of saying it,
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   then we say, "Wait a second, what's going on?"
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   And so to follow along with the content from yesterday,
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.200]   you don't see--
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.200]   And the people that can most afford to retire--
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.200]   And yes, I cherry-picked some examples yesterday,
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.200]   but I see this everywhere.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.200]   And the people who can most afford to retire,
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200]   you don't see them retiring.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   You see them just continuing on into a different phase.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.200]   So in the show yesterday, Bill Gates has this video
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.200]   about how he's going to retire and he's going to play golf
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.200]   and he's going to record music and do all these things.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.200]   But in reality, what is he doing?
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   He's still working hard, but he's working at different things.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.200]   You see Warren Buffett doing work that he finds interesting.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   You see this with former presidents.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.200]   You see this with former presidents.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.200]   Are they just unengaged?
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.200]   Is Bill Clinton just sitting around playing golf every day?
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   No. He's playing golf, but golf is integrated into his life.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   And so these conceptions of retirement that we have,
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.200]   kind of fed by our culture and fed by advertising,
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.200]   are completely flawed.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.200]   My thought is that the first way to really--
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.200]   one of the first steps that I see
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.200]   is to really adjust our conception.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   I've only been a financial planner for six years,
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.200]   but in that time I've watched some people
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.200]   make the transition to retirement,
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.200]   and I've read a lot about advisors who have worked
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.200]   with more clients than I have personally
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.200]   about that transition to retirement.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.200]   At the moment, I'm personally convinced of this.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.200]   If you are retiring only from something,
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   you've got a problem.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   If you are retiring to something,
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.200]   it's likely that it'll go successfully.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   So anecdotally, consider this.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   How many people do you know, or have at least heard of,
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   who they retired from their job to come home,
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.200]   and after a year they were back at work again
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   because they couldn't handle sitting at home?
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.200]   They couldn't handle just sitting watching TV
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   and playing golf all day.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   You play golf every day, and over time it starts to feel like work.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.200]   It really does.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.200]   I learned that lesson myself when I was in high school.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.200]   I taught wakeboarding and water skiing for a summer camp.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   I had never been an expert wakeboarder or water skier,
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.200]   but I could teach the basics,
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.200]   and I learned to teach the basics to kids
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.200]   as part of a summer camp.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.200]   My job consisted of wearing board shorts
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.200]   and driving a boat on the lake all day,
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.200]   teaching wakeboarding and water skiing.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.200]   By the end of the summer, I was so sick and tired
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.200]   of being in a boat.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.200]   One person's dream--I want to buy a ski boat
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   and go wakeboarding every day--
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   was mine.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.200]   I cannot stand to be in this boat again today.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   I am bored out of my skin.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   How we interpret things
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.200]   is very much driven by our viewpoint of it.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   But if you just hate the job that you have
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.200]   and can't wait to quit--
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   or excuse me--if you were doing a job that's okay,
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   and you just quit and do nothing--
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   we all know anecdotally the guy who retires at 65
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   and can't wait to do it and then dies of cancer at 66,
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.200]   or the guy who gets so sick--
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.200]   my grandfather--my experience with my grandfather--
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.200]   he was the one who was a professor.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200]   In his mid-80s, he was a young man.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.200]   You would have thought he was 70 if you met him.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200]   But after about three years of being retired,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.200]   he just sat down, and he was an old man.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:53.200]   And it was so sad to see.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.200]   And I wish that--you know, we tried to organize
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.200]   some tutoring and things for him,
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   but I wish he had never quit working,
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.200]   because then he could have, you know,
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   the later years of his life--
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.200]   the later years of his life,
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   he would have been much more engaged
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.200]   and just, I think, much happier.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   So this is something that I think affects all of us.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   And I feel that there is a dramatic opportunity here
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   with the prospect of financial planning,
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.200]   where instead of everything focused on,
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.200]   "Why do I keep doing this work that I don't like doing anymore
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   "so that I can--so that I can, you know, quit someday?"
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.200]   Why don't we just skip that all
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   and focus on doing work that we enjoy doing
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   that we don't want to quit from?
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   You know, I think of--in these excerpts
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   that I read from this book,
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   I think of the idea of a craftsperson.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.200]   And you had this change of somebody who was a craftsperson
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.200]   going on and becoming a factory worker.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.200]   Is the life of a craftsperson actually that bad?
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.200]   What do you see people do in retirement?
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.200]   I have a neighbor across the street,
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.200]   an older man who's retired,
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.200]   and he has a wood-turning machine,
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.200]   and he's out in his garage every day
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   making bowls and wooden utensils and things
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.200]   that he just really enjoys.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.200]   Don't you see this a lot with retired people,
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200]   is that they reinstitute some hobby?
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.200]   And I find it so interesting that in a world
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.200]   where we're disconnected from the results of our work,
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.200]   we're disconnected from being able to see a project through
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   from beginning to end,
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   that what we naturally gravitate to in retirement
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.200]   is producing that type of work again.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.200]   So why don't we turn the whole conversation on its head?
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.200]   And instead of spending all of our time
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200]   talking about retirement,
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.200]   why don't we spend a good amount of time
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.200]   talking about designing the ultimate life
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.200]   and the ideal life that we wish to live,
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.200]   and not letting the financial planning get in the way of that,
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   not letting the idea that I have to work this mind-numbing job
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   for another 30 years just so I can retire.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.200]   Why don't we just quit and do something
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.200]   that we would be engaged with?
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.200]   Now, I do believe--and this is me personally--
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.200]   I do believe there's a huge value in saving money.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.200]   And I do believe there's a huge value in financial independence.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.200]   I am not currently financially independent.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   I can't sit around and just do whatever I want to do
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   and not make money.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.200]   I need to keep working and creating income.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.200]   I think you probably only really know
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   if you really want to keep doing what you're doing
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.200]   if you were financially independent.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.200]   And sometimes I wonder--
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.200]   again, it's always tough to describe reasons--
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.200]   but I wonder if people would stay at their jobs so much
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   if they were financially independent.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   And my anecdotal experience and what we experience--
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.200]   if you read surveys that show that 70% of Americans
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.200]   are unhappy with work, the answer is no.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.200]   So just to point out a couple of details of this,
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.200]   when I design--
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.200]   when I consult with a business owner
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.200]   and I'm designing a benefits plan with them as a consultant,
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.200]   then one of the primary things that we're looking to do
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   is try to figure--we're asking the client,
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.200]   "What do they want?
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.200]   "What are you trying to accomplish with your benefits plan?"
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   And generally, the most common thing that an employer
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.200]   is looking to accomplish with their benefits plan
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.200]   is the idea of increasing employee stickiness.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   How do we keep the good employees?
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   Because it's very expensive and very difficult
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   to go out and find another good employee
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.200]   if you already have one.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.200]   And the way that you do that is you can create
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.200]   what we call in the business "golden handcuffs."
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.200]   There's kind of two aspects to benefits planning.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.200]   You can create golden handcuffs,
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   or you can create the golden handshake.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.200]   And so the golden handcuffs is the idea of,
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   "How can I keep the people that I want
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   "working with my business?"
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   You know how you do that? Pensions.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.200]   Pensions that have a deferred vesting schedule
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.200]   that give people an incentive to stay and work
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.200]   that goes beyond current situations.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   And this can be a win-win.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.200]   It can be a win for the employer and a win for the employee.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.200]   There's substantial tax benefits.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.200]   The employee feels more engaged.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.200]   The employee has incentives to stay with that job.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200]   And the employer is able to retain those employees
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200]   for a longer period of time.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.200]   It doesn't have to go and search for new employees.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   But it's not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   But if you understand that my employer
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   is trying to get some hooks into me,
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   that I'm getting some golden handcuffs,
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   it puts things into the proper scenario.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   It doesn't mean you're not willing to go through with it.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.200]   It just puts things in the proper perspective.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.200]   On the other hand, consider the golden handshake.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   So the golden handshake is,
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.200]   "How do you usher the employees out of your business
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.200]   "that you no longer want?"
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.200]   You see this in the news a lot of times.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.200]   You see this with companies,
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.200]   or I think it was like the Postal Service
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   a couple years ago was doing this,
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.200]   was offering early retirement.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.200]   So we have here this whole paragraph
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   that says that retirement was sanctioned
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   as a form of unemployment relief.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.200]   And so you offer retirement
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.200]   to reduce the size of the workforce.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.200]   And we offer retirement to reduce the size of the workforce
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   to lower the unemployment percentages
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   of people looking for work or people able to work.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.200]   And we cut out all the retirees now.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.200]   Well, that accomplishes a political objective,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200]   but we have to sell that.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   So you have to sell it with the concept of golden handcuffs.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.200]   So when you're offered an early retirement,
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.200]   there has to be some financial incentive
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.200]   for somebody to accept it.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.200]   But it changes your mind if you realize,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.200]   "Wait a second, they're trying to get me out."
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.200]   Now, you may again choose it.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.200]   You may choose to take that and go and build something else,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200]   but they're trying to get you out.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   Now, there's lots of other considerations to this,
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.200]   and I don't want to be overly simplistic.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.200]   But I did want to walk through that history,
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.200]   because with that history,
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.200]   I think we can start to understand a little bit.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   And we can start to understand that these political debates,
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   the political, you know, the use of Social Security
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.200]   as a tool, as a political tool, is not new.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.200]   From day one, it was intended as a political tool.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.200]   There's an interesting aspect in this book.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.200]   I don't know if I can find it quickly enough here to read it.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.200]   I didn't mark it.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.200]   But when Social Security went--
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.200]   some information that I hadn't known
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:08.200]   is that FDR instituted and Social Security was instituted
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:13.200]   partly in reaction to another competing proposal
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200]   that was a non-contributory system
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   that was proposed by another politician.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.200]   Again, I don't remember these names.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.200]   But that the other idea was a non-contributory system.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.200]   It's that Social Security was issued as a contributory system
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   where Social Security taxes would be contributed by the worker
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   and then by the employee to fund the system--
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200]   the employer to fund the system.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200]   So I hope this has been interesting today,
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.200]   and I hope that you've enjoyed this contact.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.200]   If anybody knows William Grabener--
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.200]   I'm trying to find him and get a hold of him.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200]   I'd really love to interview him,
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.200]   because this book was written in 1980, and that's 30 years ago.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:50.200]   And so the context of this being written
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   right after the passage of ERISA,
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   the Employee Retirement Income Security Act,
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.200]   which I think, if my memory is correct, was '78.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.200]   It was late '70s anyway.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200]   So this book was being written,
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.200]   and clearly that's what he's talking about at the end.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   He's talking about the impact of ERISA legislation.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.200]   And today, ask any person who is any practitioner
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:14.200]   active in the world of benefits planning,
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.200]   and ERISA governs much of what we do.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.200]   And ERISA has a huge impact,
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.200]   and you're constantly figuring out
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.200]   how to maintain compliance with ERISA.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.200]   And I'm not going to talk about what's good, what's bad, whatever.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   It's been around for my entire working lifetime,
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.200]   and it just is, so you have to deal with it.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.200]   But it's very interesting to have a little bit of historical context.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.200]   If anybody knows William Grabener, let me know.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.200]   I would love to have him on the show.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:44.200]   At some point in time, I will be able to read this other retirement book,
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.200]   "The Evolution of Retirement" by Dora Costa.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.200]   I'm interested in reading that.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:53.200]   And I'm also interested, if any of you are aware of any other resources,
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.200]   any other scholarly books on this subject
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.200]   that you think would be interesting, let me know that,
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.200]   because I'd be interested in reading about them.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   I highly commend this book to you.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   I highly commend it.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.200]   If you're interested in the scholarly research,
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.200]   I clearly didn't talk about the footnotes,
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.200]   but it's one thing to read an article that doesn't have a single footnote in it,
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.200]   and it's another thing to see the bibliography and the footnotes
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.200]   of an academic book like this.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.200]   So I would love to have some more people read it and discuss it.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   Let me know your comments on today's show.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.200]   Come by the blog.

[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.200]   If I don't speak with you before tomorrow, have a happy 4th of July,
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.200]   and focus, with tomorrow being Independence Day,
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.200]   what this show is going to be about is basically
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.200]   how to create your own financial independence.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:46.200]   And hopefully you'll like the start of the shows this week.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:52.200]   I'd love to hear feedback, and I will keep creating great content for you.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.200]   But the neat thing about you as an early listener of the show,
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   you have an opportunity to have a great influence over the direction of the show.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.200]   So bring on your comments and questions.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   Come by the blog, and have a happy 4th of July.
