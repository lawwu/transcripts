[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   Today's question deals with a common situation for a lot of us. Jehovah
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.720]   Witnesses, ring your doorbell and you answer it. Pastor John, what will you say?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:20.400]   Well I've developed an approach that might not be for everybody, and it
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.040]   depends on whether you have time to talk deeply and extensively. If you feel like
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.360]   this is not the time to get into an argument, here's what I've done.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.520]   And we used to get a lot more at our front door here in this neighborhood
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.120]   than we have recently. Maybe they put me on a blacklist or something. But if they
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.720]   would come to the door, and they always come in twos, I would say as gently and
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.920]   graciously as I could, you know, I know Jehovah's Witness theology enough to
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.600]   know that we have deep differences. I know that you believe Jesus is the
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:10.800]   highest created being, a created angel, Michael, and you do not believe that he
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.840]   is God, that he is of one essence with Jehovah. You think he's an angel. I
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.760]   believe he is co-eternal with Jehovah God, and therefore I think your religion
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.120]   is a serious dishonoring of the Lord Jesus, and leads people astray from a
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.760]   true relationship with God. And so what I'd like to do with you right now—I'm
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.680]   saying this right here on the porch—is pray. And I'm willing to let you pray, and
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.960]   I'll pray, and we'll both ask that God would show us what's true in his Word,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.440]   the true way to understand the Bible, the true way to honor Jesus. Would you want
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.960]   to pray with me? They have never agreed to pray with me. They have just left at
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.440]   that point. So I'm not sure what's behind that, but that's my approach, is to set up
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.120]   the disagreement, explain it clearly, offer to pray, and they've never
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.440]   accepted. Now I'd say one other thing. That doesn't enter you into a dialogue
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.320]   very well, and I think there is a place for serious witnessing and extended time
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.240]   with Jehovah's Witnesses, and therefore if it goes to that—and I've sat in
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.320]   my living room for hours with folks from the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.120]   direction I go is twofold. One, I show them from the Scriptures that I do
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.760]   believe Jesus Christ is vastly, infinitely more than a created being. And
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.440]   I'd go to John 1, "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.720]   Word was God." And I know what they're gonna do at that point is get out their
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   New World Translation and say, "No, no, it doesn't really say that." And I would say,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.880]   "But look at the next verse. He was in the beginning with God, all things were made
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.240]   through him, and without him was not anything made that was made." So I think
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.240]   that is worded explicitly to exclude the fact that he was made. He is the maker,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.520]   not the made, and they believe he was made. So even with their New World
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.560]   Translation, I don't think it works. And at the end of the Gospel, Thomas says, "My
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.120]   Lord and my God," and all through the Gospel of John, Jesus is presented as the
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.880]   divine one who existed before Abraham. And then you go to the Gospel of Luke,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.360]   and you have the Virgin birth, and Elizabeth saying to Mary when she sews
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.480]   up with Jesus in her womb, "Why is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.400]   And in the very next two verses, she refers to God as her Lord. And so you
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.460]   have Luke testifying this way, and then you have Paul, "For in him all the
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.720]   fullness of deity was pleased to dwell," in Colossians 119, and "For in him the
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.880]   whole fullness of deity dwells bodily," Colossians 2.9. So that's my first take.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.680]   Go to the Trinity and argue from the Bible for the deity of Jesus. And then
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.800]   the last thing is, when you deny the deity of Christ, when you diminish who it
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.400]   was who died on the cross, you almost inevitably change the doctrine of the
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.640]   Atonement. And they do. Justification by faith alone falls apart in the
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.160]   Jehovah's Witness theology, and law begins to creep in, and works begin to
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.440]   take their place alongside faith as the ground, because, I think in root, because
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.240]   the Atonement just isn't great enough, because the Christ isn't great enough
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.060]   who died for us, and so you're going to get a kind of works religion with the
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.120]   Jehovah's Witness that I think undermines the gospel.
