[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - John Piper is back with us
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.720]   coming off of a six week writing leave.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.600]   And Pastor John, you have written a new book
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600]   and I wanna talk to you about what you've written soon.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.820]   But first, as a writer, I would love to know
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.320]   what you've learned more generally
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.240]   about the writing process from this past six weeks.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.440]   And maybe give us some lessons that writers can learn from
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.920]   as you reflect back on this time.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.760]   - It's a huge gift to have a writing leave.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.080]   Most writers write in between things
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.240]   and I get this incredible gift of once a year or so
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.880]   getting six to eight weeks where I can do nothing but write.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.800]   And for me, the conceptualization stage
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.840]   is the absolute hardest.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040]   I tend to quit before I get started.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.320]   It's so frustrating.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.240]   But once I'm off and running, you know,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.500]   it's like pushing a car.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.480]   Getting the thing going is hard.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.600]   But once you get it rolling,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.520]   then you could probably keep it going by yourself.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.880]   And you need about six guys to get started with it.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.440]   So I stepped back and asked,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.200]   what did I learn about that initial process
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200]   and then the actual writing?
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.760]   And I'm assuming here that we're talking
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   about a nonfiction book, about a topic.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.280]   And I'm assuming that people are writing
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.440]   against the backdrop of ongoing Bible reading
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.840]   and meditation and prayer and participation
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.720]   in a local church.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.840]   That's assumption.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.120]   So here's number one.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.840]   Plan a block of time that you can commit to regularly.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.600]   For me, that was every day, six days a week
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.120]   from about nine in the morning
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.120]   after devotions and exercise and breakfast.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.520]   So about nine in the morning to about seven in the evening
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.760]   with maybe half hour off for lunch.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.460]   Number two, decide on a general topic
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.680]   that you intend to address.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.520]   For me, that was a want to write a book about the Bible.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.120]   And I thought it was a book about how to get from the Bible,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.600]   the treasures of the Bible and how to live those out.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.280]   In other words, a how-to book about using the Bible
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.560]   most effectively in your spiritual walk.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.720]   And I proved to be totally wrong about that,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.080]   but that should encourage people
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   that you can set out to write something
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   and then wind up writing something totally different.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.600]   So that's number two.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.440]   Pick out the general topic.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   Number three, pray earnestly and call upon others to pray.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.240]   I have a whole prayer team
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.120]   that I keep posted on what I'm doing.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.240]   Pray and have others pray for you.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.680]   Pray daily, pray hourly over your work
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920]   and ask God for motivation.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.000]   Ask him for perseverance and for insight and creativity
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   and ask him for competence and truthfulness
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.920]   and faithfulness to the scriptures.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   Ask him for a touch from God
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.800]   that will make the book a great honor to Christ
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.660]   and good for the church
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.760]   and an advancement to the global mission
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.600]   of the people of God.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.000]   That's the way I pray about what I write.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Number four, read over what you have already written
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.160]   about the topic.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.800]   So for me, that was like 30 sermons
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.760]   that I'd written about this topic over the years,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120]   and I did not want to take the time to do that,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.940]   and I didn't.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.600]   I skimmed them and looked at their themes
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.320]   'cause I knew if I took the time to read all of those,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.040]   I would just get so bogged down.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.680]   And here, I know I'm assuming
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.080]   that people have written something.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.500]   And why would I assume that?
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.440]   Well, I'm assuming that if there's a topic
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.000]   on which you intend to write a book,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.080]   you've thought about it.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.880]   And if you're a writer,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.760]   thinking about it means you've written down something.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.720]   Might be in a journal, a blog, an essay, a sermon,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.920]   a lesson, a notebook, somewhere you've written about this
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.880]   or you shouldn't be intending to write a book about it.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.760]   Not for a long time yet.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.640]   So dig all that stuff up,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.600]   pull it out of your journals and wherever it is
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.040]   and then pull it all together and read over it.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.920]   That's number four.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.240]   Number five, as you read that stuff,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.800]   make an ideal list of all sorts of issues
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   that could be addressed in the book.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.600]   You might be writing this on your computer,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.840]   you might be by hand.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.320]   I'll say more about that in just a minute.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.360]   This will be a completely random list at first.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.560]   It just be a mess on your piece of paper.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.600]   When you've read all your material,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.860]   make a brainstorm about what you've got there
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.840]   and make that list as long as you can.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.360]   In other words, when you're done reading,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.040]   keep making ideas and putting them down.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.320]   So now you've got a page or several pages
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.680]   of just jumble of ideas that this book might contain.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   Number six, step back and look at that ideal list
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.320]   and use a pencil to draw lines.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.120]   Now here, if you put that on a computer,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.700]   if you made that list on a computer, print it out.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.060]   I don't know any way to do what I'm talking about here
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.200]   on the computer.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.320]   I don't think the technology's there to do this.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.240]   Print it out or two or three,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.340]   lay them all out in front of you,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.800]   tape them together if you have to,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.880]   if you got more than one sheet
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.120]   and start drawing lines between them.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.800]   Circle them and block them and look for patterns
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.560]   on that jumbled sheet of ideas
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.200]   until you see things kind of falling together
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.340]   and keep scribbling down new ideas as you do this
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.040]   because every time you start to make a connection,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.420]   another question, another idea is gonna come to your mind.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.420]   Number seven, from all that confusing, random, messy,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.660]   big taped together piece of paper
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.740]   that seemed to have no coherence whatsoever
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.760]   except a few jumbled connections
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   that you've circled and drawn arrows to,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.620]   this is the real discouraging, paralyzing point
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.840]   where you look at it and say, "Good night.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.340]   "How will that ever become a book?
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.600]   "How can I ever bring sense out of that
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.120]   "or turn that into a book?"
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.440]   I mean, it really keeps a lot of people
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.880]   from moving forward.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.040]   So here, at this point, I'm saying,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.120]   take a few minutes and jot down
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.160]   one of the ideas from that sheet
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.480]   that you think you could start writing about.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.820]   Doesn't matter whether it become a chapter
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.940]   or whatever, just something you could start writing about.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.960]   Put that at the top of a piece of paper,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.360]   that idea, that sentence, and then jot down under it,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.440]   don't take too long doing this,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   15 minutes of ideas that you might say about that.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.840]   And that's, you haven't even begun to write yet.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.800]   But I'm not talking about weeks of doing this.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.080]   I'm talking about that would take maybe a day or two,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.960]   depending on how much of your stuff that you have to read.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.440]   And this is the point that's so frustrating
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.560]   'cause everything's a jumble.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.680]   And so that's everything up till writing.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.080]   I think I'll stop here and maybe continue next time on,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.040]   okay, now the writing.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.320]   What lessons did you learn about the actual writing?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.360]   - Excellent, that sounds good.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.200]   Let's do that.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   But one immediate takeaway for someone
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.200]   who wants to write a book,
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.880]   but for them it seems like a far off dream at this point,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.080]   they should just be journaling right now, right?
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.880]   - Right, if a person doesn't have the book
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.680]   on their agenda for tomorrow, but five years out,
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.640]   because they're dreaming of something
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.320]   that's just utterly fascinated them,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.460]   then yes, they should be thinking,
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.000]   and that means writing now.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.360]   So a journal is one possibility,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.020]   or some kind of idea, notebook.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.440]   In my early days as a pastor, I kept two,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.420]   I only made two of these and then I stopped,
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.320]   but they were really fruitful.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.520]   I call them the sermon garden.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.240]   I still have those, they're ring binders,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   about 50, 60 pages each,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.660]   where I just gave idea after idea after idea
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.560]   that came to me in devotions and elsewhere.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.760]   So yes, a book comes into being not out of nowhere,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.080]   it grows in the garden of thinking and ideas.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.600]   - Wonderful, thank you Pastor John.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.800]   And if you are listening to this and you're a writer,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.620]   or you wonder if maybe God has called you
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.040]   to become a writer in the future,
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.440]   we have a very interesting episode
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.640]   from early in our episodes, episode number three in fact,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.800]   titled "How Important is a Christian Writer's Influence?"
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.080]   You can find that in the podcast archive.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.640]   It's episode number three,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.560]   "How Important is a Christian Writer's Influence?"
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.680]   So we have talked about the research phase,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   so what has Pastor John recently learned
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.020]   about the writing process?
