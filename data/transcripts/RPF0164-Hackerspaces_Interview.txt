[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.320]   Radical Personal Finance is a community project.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.600]   It was created by me, but it's funded by you, much like the theme of today's show.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.440]   For information on how you can get involved in supporting the show,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.560]   please go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   Today on the show, we're going to dig into the concept of hackerspaces.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.320]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with this concept or not, but a hackerspace is a beautiful idea
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.120]   that you need to know about. That's why I'm bringing it to you on the show.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.960]   In essence, it's a way for communities to come together and create a space
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.760]   for people to create stuff, to simply come up with and create cool stuff.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.080]   And the variation and the possibilities of this
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.000]   are huge. It's also potentially life-changing for many people, including maybe you.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:26.080]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.040]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and today is Thursday, March 5, 2015.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880]   Today I bring you an interview with Jessica Fong.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   Jessica is one of the founding members of the Southside Hackerspace in Chicago.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.720]   And if you're new to this concept or to this idea, definitely pay attention to today's show.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.600]   It's a concept that has the potential of revolutionizing many neighborhoods.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:59.200]   In our modern society, there's a real dearth of
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.440]   possibilities of places to go to simply make and do stuff.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.080]   We seem to have changed over time from a less hands-on society to a more
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.920]   digits-on society or a more bits-and-bytes society.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.840]   And yet the value of actually being hands-on with things is bigger than it's ever been.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.280]   And several years ago, I heard about the concept of hackerspaces or makerspaces.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.400]   I hear them referred to interchangeably and was absolutely fascinated with the idea.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.280]   And a listener of the show reached out to me and said, "Hey, I think you might be
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.720]   interested in interviewing a friend of mine."
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.640]   And that was how this friend came on the show.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.720]   It was Jessica from Chicago.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.960]   And Jessica is one of the founding members of this Southside Hackerspace.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.640]   And you know what?
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.320]   Let me skip the preamble and let her tell you about what is a hackerspace and why she do care.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.960]   Let's get to it.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.480]   Jessica, welcome to the show.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.000]   I appreciate you making time for me today.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.680]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.880]   Thank you so much for inviting me.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.560]   >> I brought you on based upon a listener suggestion.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.080]   And I'm excited to bring this topic onto the show.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.960]   I haven't mentioned it before, but talking about hackerspaces and makerspaces.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.440]   Kick us off by introducing yourself a little bit and just share with me
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.760]   your story and how you got into this hackerspace, makerspace world.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.280]   >> Sure.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.840]   So I graduated with a degree in architecture from Illinois Institute of Technology.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.600]   I'm in Chicago right now.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.280]   And I've really been interested in entrepreneurship since forever.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.080]   My family has owned restaurants and I come up with ideas every single day.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:50.240]   And I sort of fell into this hackerspace, makerspace movement about, I'd say, a year
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.600]   and a half ago in a desire to advocate for STEM plus education and continued learning.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.120]   And hackerspace is actually comprised mostly of, you know, the board is comprised mostly
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.680]   of alumni from my school.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.720]   So it was really interesting to be able to see what they were up to.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.880]   Hackerspaces and makerspaces in general, you know, usually focus on peer learning
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.560]   and knowledge sharing, things like that.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:29.360]   And so it seemed really natural to move in this non-profit direction and focus on that
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.720]   individual and power advocacy and utilizing sort of free softwares and open source materials
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.680]   and things like that.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.080]   So it's really exploded over the past couple of years, the movement in general.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.360]   >> Describe the concept of a makerspace.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.840]   What is it?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.760]   >> So a lot of people use hackerspace and makerspace interchangeably.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.240]   I've heard them defined a couple of different ways.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.400]   But when it comes down to it, it's really about having a community-operated space.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.880]   So it's comprised of volunteers and members.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.320]   And there's a fifth habit that has all sorts of different tools.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.880]   They can be woodworking, metalworking, electronics.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.480]   I believe the earlier ones started out focusing mostly on electronics, which is kind of where
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.640]   you get the hacker space notion.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.040]   But nowadays, the term hack really applies to a lot of quick fixes and DIY things.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.480]   So I think the term has really sort of evolved from there.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.760]   But they utilize a lot of open labs, workshops, lectures, presentations,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.560]   local educational activities.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.400]   And people just come into the space.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.520]   They become members.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.680]   They work on their own projects.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.440]   Or they help each other out trying to invent new things together.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.200]   And it's really a different culture for each sort of hackerspace or makerspace you go to.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.640]   There's a slightly different focus.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:01.120]   But overall, all of them are all about the duocracy, the idea that you make something
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.760]   with your own two hands in order to progress and to learn.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.480]   >> And then one of the massive benefits, at least that I've understood, and unfortunately,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.880]   there's none here locally.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.040]   And I've actually never been to anybody's facility that's actually involved in this.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.960]   It's just pure online research.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.960]   But one of the big benefits is a well-funded, well-put-together, well-run makerspace might
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.560]   have access to just dozens and dozens and dozens of unique, different tools and then
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.760]   mentors, people to help create projects.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.680]   So it's just really an incredible place to be able to learn new skills to create things,
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.180]   right?
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.040]   >> Yeah, that's correct.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.520]   A lot of what I guess the pros of having a makerspace in your community is that, for
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.920]   the most part, they're very affordable.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.800]   They are different tiers of membership.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.440]   So at Southside Hackerspace, which is the hackerspace that I help run, we have a starving
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.120]   hacker tier, which is more for students and things like that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.720]   And it's really great because it's $28 a month.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.960]   So if you're a student, you have your own storage and things like that at your dorm
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.360]   or whatever.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.400]   You can just truck it over, work on a project, and then bring it back.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.320]   And then there's a full membership, which is $50 a month.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.520]   And that's use of all the tools in the space, regardless of whether it's starving hacker
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.800]   or full hacker membership.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.760]   And you're right about one of the big pros is having those mentors and having those people
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   who are willing to collaborate with you.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.240]   Because you never know the opportunity that you might get to partner up with somebody.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:48.160]   And the fact that this sort of support group that you join is going to have very niche
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.880]   markets.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.920]   It's going to lead you to specific interest groups.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.080]   You're going to tap into such a huge database of knowledge.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.560]   And a lot of things are possible just yourself coming to space and being exposed to all of
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.200]   those things.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.360]   >> When I first heard of the concept, one of the things that immediately stood out to
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.640]   me about it, it seems like a much more efficient allocation of funds for people who are interested
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.360]   in learning things and building things.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.000]   I think if possible, I would almost always prefer to rent something rather than own it.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.560]   Because there are certain costs associated with owning it.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.920]   And then one of the bigger things is most tools, I simply don't use enough to justify
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.640]   really owning them.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.280]   I have a couple of circular saws.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.040]   And I use them, what, a couple times a year?
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.960]   And then you get to something like with woodworking.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   If you want to have a table saw, I can't justify owning a table saw.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.120]   But man, there are times when if you want to make something, owning a table saw is the
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.000]   tool that you need.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.880]   And if you could bring that together, and that's just woodworking tools, with electronics
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.600]   there's different things.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.320]   But if you could just bring that together, and everyone can buy a share, partial ownership,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.560]   which entitles them to the use of the tool.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.400]   As long as you get the number of tools to the number of members and their busyness right,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.680]   which I'm sure is a challenge sometimes in some very busy places, it can just be such
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   an efficient way to allow people access to tools without having to buy them.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.480]   And when you have access to high-end tools, I mean, the things that you can do are amazing.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:33.280]   There are a lot of tools that we've discovered are enormous in size.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.040]   They're just obscene.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.720]   You cannot fit them barely in a garage sometimes.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.000]   So imagining somebody living in a city like Chicago here, you know, there's not a lot
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.320]   of real estate when you're in a studio apartment to take up, you know, all that room with a
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.760]   table saw or something like that.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.640]   So having a local space that you can go to and to work in there and, you know, get dirty
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.000]   and have sawdust everywhere and have your projects sit there, you know, you slap your
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   name on it and leave it there for a while to work on, that is big money in a city like
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.880]   this where you have so many awesome ideas you want to put forth, but you just can't
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.080]   fit them in your apartment.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.160]   Right, right.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.640]   Another thing that has really attracted me to makerspaces is I've heard that they can
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.720]   be really just excellent business incubators.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.280]   I think so.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   Is that true?
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.440]   I would definitely agree with that.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.200]   Of course, there are lots of positives and negatives to that.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.280]   You get the positive, obviously, of getting access to tools that you normally wouldn't
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.640]   get access to, the mentorship that we talked about.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.000]   So you get rapid prototyping is now a possibility.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.440]   You can churn things out, you know.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.280]   There's collaboration, which could lead to even, you know, monetary support.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.200]   There are lots of mini organizations that form within hackerspaces that get support
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.560]   or run their own campaigns.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.360]   A big one is that you avoid huge upfront investment costs, obviously, because you don't
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.200]   have to own that equipment, but also because a lot of the times you can share material
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.160]   costs as well.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.560]   So you, you know, make a joint trip maybe with somebody who has a truck to go get a
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.320]   huge pile of wood and bring it back.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.720]   And so now you have all that to use.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.880]   And the other thing is the startup mentality.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.920]   You're trying new things, you're testing things out, you're letting yourself fail
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.200]   and to improve.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.320]   But there are a lot of cons as well, I guess.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.560]   Obviously, it costs to be a member.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.240]   There's limited storage space at the actual space.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.480]   Sometimes they can be inconveniently located or unfortunately, in your case, nowhere nearby
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:52.800]   at all.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.360]   And they are public spaces sometimes too.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.680]   So a makerspace that's at a library, you're going to have to bend to their rules about
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.120]   how they conduct their work there.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.000]   So there's that as well.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.560]   >> How did you get involved with trying to start one?
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.480]   >> I actually got involved because a former classmate of mine came by one time and said,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.640]   "Hey, would you be interested in doing PR for this organization that I've been working
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:24.800]   on?"
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.440]   So that's kind of how I hopped into it.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.080]   I'm really interested in sort of what that scene was like, I guess.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.640]   It was something that I had never heard of before either.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:42.160]   And I thought that it was just the most amazing thing because I was looking a little bit beyond
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.320]   that and saying, "Well, how is this ability to have people of all ages, any age pretty
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.560]   much?"
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.880]   Obviously, you don't want little ones messing around with power tools.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:59.680]   But teenagers, adults coming in and being able to use that kind of space and feel safe
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:05.760]   in that environment, how do you transfer that into education?
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.520]   Well, it's already education.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.200]   And a lot of what's interesting about the school system in Chicago is that there are
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.360]   certain districts and areas that they don't have opportunities for the students to study
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.640]   STEM+ like science, technology, math, engineering.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.960]   So it's really important to expose people at a young age and encourage people at an
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.640]   older age to feel free to play with things like that.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.400]   And I know for me, I've heard theoretically that they used to have shop class in high
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:42.720]   school.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.440]   I would shop and metal shop and mechanic stuff.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.880]   And I was always a little bit jealous because in my era, we never had any of that.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   And it's possible I did go to a private school, which was certainly a well-funded
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.360]   school, but they didn't have that.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.400]   My understanding is a few of the government schools around here do have that.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.920]   But it's very abnormal.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.640]   And I always felt like I was missing out.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.800]   And to this day, I feel pretty inept when it comes to most mechanical things.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   Thankfully, I did a bunch of stuff with electronics kits when I was a kid.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.640]   I got a ham radio license when I was a kid.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.360]   And I built some different radio stuff.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.760]   And that was really fun to get an opportunity.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.280]   And my dad's an electrical engineer.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.560]   So I learned he taught me how to solder and create a circuit board and do all of that
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:32.800]   stuff.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:39.360]   But we didn't have a lot of access to the tools and to the shop and to the environment.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.440]   And I often wonder to this day, I think if I were just-- I don't know.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.880]   I'm not confident enough in my desire to go out and get interested in these things, to
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.120]   go out and buy a bunch of tools for myself.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.440]   And I'm more of like, why would I spend $3,000 on tools I may or may not use?
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.840]   But if I could go somewhere and pay $50 a month to be around a community of people and
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.520]   just watch them and learn and kind of see what I was interested in, whether that was
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.600]   a leatherworking station or a metalworking or to learn how to weld, to me, that would
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.160]   be amazing.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.600]   And now you take it to kids, and you just think, what a tremendous opportunity that
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.080]   can be to help with somebody's education, just to get them around it.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.920]   Because so much of schooling is focused on academics and nothing on hands-on.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.560]   And some people think very well on paper and in their mind.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.880]   And some people think with their hands while they're making stuff.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.200]   And how awesome would it be to have just community shops all over this country and,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.960]   frankly, all over the world where kids could go and spend a lot of time with older mentors
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   and adults who could teach them the skills that are, frankly, being lost?
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.600]   It's just an amazing-- I get excited just thinking about it.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.000]   [LAUGHS]
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:16:02.080]   It is really exciting because there's nothing like making something from scratch with your
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.920]   hands, whether or not it's knitting something or building furniture or welding or whatever
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.240]   it is.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.840]   There's so little that can teach you in the classroom when you just look at a material
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.400]   in a book, a picture of it, and it's in your hands.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.720]   And I think that it's almost like the service industry.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:29.920]   You have to be a part of it before you really understand the value that you get from
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.200]   participating in it.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.800]   And I've been so amazed by the demographic of people who participate in the makerspace
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.680]   community.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.720]   When I first went to the Chicago Public Library, they have a wonderful maker lab.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:53.440]   I went to a couple classes, free classes there, and teenagers and children to come
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.320]   to these classes.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:01.680]   No, it was mostly adults, I would say probably 40-plus.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.280]   And they were fully engaged.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.200]   They were asking questions.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.720]   They were working with the instructors step by step.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.960]   They were not shy about getting involved and helping each other.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.480]   And there was no sort of pretense as to, "I am so much more knowledgeable than you are.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.280]   Let me go and see how awesome I am."
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.200]   It was completely positive.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.720]   It was all collaboration the entire time.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.040]   There's no negativity in that room.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.920]   And it astounded me that there are so many people who are willing to put themselves forward
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.720]   to just throw themselves into this environment that some of them had never even seen a 3D
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.160]   printer work before.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:49.760]   And to see the wonder as they're experiencing that is so rewarding.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.320]   There's nothing better than being able to show somebody and teach something something
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:54.820]   new.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.640]   Absolutely.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.680]   I think we're all – those of us who are so-called knowledge workers, I think we're
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:08.720]   all a little bit desperate to see the work of our hand in some way, to be able to create
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.880]   something and step back and look at it.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.360]   And so I enjoy mowing the lawn because you can step back and look.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.400]   I did that.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   I actually did something visible.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.920]   It wasn't just 14 emails that I sent off or some idea that I created.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.800]   It was visible.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.240]   Here's the work of my hands.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:34.160]   I think as our society goes so heavy and even more day by day into that knowledge work idea,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.840]   I think there's going to be more and more people who want to have the experience of
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.880]   creating something.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.600]   I totally agree.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.960]   What stage are you with regard – and so I'm asking this as a selfish question because
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.080]   I really have thought of doing this here locally.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.640]   It's one of many projects on my someday maybe list of things that I don't have – I
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.800]   simply don't have the capacity for right now, but I keep coming back to it and saying
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.320]   this should exist where I live.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.560]   Somebody should do this and I don't see anybody doing it.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.200]   So I either have to find somebody and inspire them to do it or I have to do it myself.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.400]   And so I'm just interested in the actual process.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.440]   As you're building this space, first of all, what phase are you in with the project
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.720]   you're involved with in Chicago?
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.400]   Do you have a fully open and functioning space or is it still being built out?
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.900]   Where are you?
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.600]   Yeah, so Southside Hacker Space was formed about three years ago.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.200]   Our three-year birthday party is actually coming up pretty soon and we are fully functioning
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.680]   now.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.640]   Our doors are open.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   We're accepting members and really it started out in someone's garage and then meeting
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:50.480]   around in public spaces just to kind of flush out the idea of what we wanted in this particular
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.000]   hacker space.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.960]   From then on, it's a lot of, I guess, nitty-gritty of where's the best location, what kind
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:07.600]   of neighborhoods are we trying to service, and do we get either purchasing or donations.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:14.160]   A lot of what we receive are donations from other small or big tech companies that are
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.360]   within the city, people even who are like, "Oh, I've got this cabinet in my garage
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.400]   that I'm not using anymore.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.280]   Do you guys want it?"
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.560]   So a lot of that stuff is community-based.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.400]   You just reach out either through online or calling people even.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:35.280]   And we do have several people who call us or email us saying, "Hey, I'm really
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.880]   interested in starting up a hacker space in my local area.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.960]   What are some tips that you can provide or can you actually make a trip over here and
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   let me know if there's something that I'm missing?"
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.480]   So that's all very exciting.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:56.400]   But yeah, we're open right now and we have a really great set of members and the culture
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.680]   of our space is very positive.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.720]   So I'm very pleased with that.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.960]   I'm sure that countless of hours have been donated and invested by you and the founding
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.520]   team.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.040]   Do you have any sense of how much money has come out of pocket to get things going?
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.560]   Oh, that's a tough question.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.560]   I'm not sure if I really know the exact number.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.360]   I personally do, yes, invest a lot of my spare time in just running the organization.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.720]   I joke with the rest of the board that it's my second job after my full-time job.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:39.680]   And all of us do put in at least, I would say, hours a week just running things or networking
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.480]   and stuff like that.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.880]   It really depends on the space that you get as well.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.160]   If you can manage to get a space with somebody else, then your rent costs are a lot cheaper.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.280]   And like I said, a lot of what we received were donations.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:01.920]   So the things that you really have to make sure you cover are your rent and any insurance
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.720]   that pertains to your particular city and your district, your location, and if you're
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.480]   filing for 501(c)(3) and things like that as a non-profit or if you're going to be
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.240]   a for-profit, different things like that have different fees and costs and waivers and everything
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.280]   like that that you need to sign.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.920]   You mentioned non-profit versus for-profit.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.440]   Are you aware of anybody who's made a business off of starting and running hackerspaces?
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:36.880]   Yeah, actually, there are lots of people that sort of start out, I think, with the idea
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   that, "Oh, we're going to end," and they discover, "Oh, well, maybe our passion
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.000]   is really in this one area," and they either turn it into a for-profit or they have the
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.960]   idea from the start.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:55.200]   A lot of these are similar to TechShop where it's tools that people can almost come in
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:03.360]   and like a makerspace, you pay them a due and you rent the space for a daily pass or
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:10.240]   a weekly pass or a monthly pass or something like that, and that really use the tools,
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.640]   do your own business and pop out.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:22.240]   But there are places that focus on classes as well, and that's all lumped into whatever
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.840]   costs that you would pay to join or get that pass for that month.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:35.360]   So it's really a toss-up, but there are definitely some that are in Chicago right
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.760]   now that are functioning as for-profits.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:46.000]   One of the things on my list I've been trying to make time is to get to a maker fair, and
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.560]   there are actually some of those nearby, and the timing hasn't worked out.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.760]   Are you involved with that scene at all, and are you able to describe what the maker fairs
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   are and why they exist and what they're about?
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.680]   Yeah, maker fairs are pretty much a big party for everybody who's involved in the maker
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.400]   community.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.240]   You know, it's kind of like a convention.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.520]   There are booths set up.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.000]   You get specific makerspace or hackerspace and what you do there.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.240]   A lot of them have free activities for kids and adults to do.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:25.200]   So we went to the Northside Maker Fair here in Chicago, and we were printing 3D models
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.360]   and 3D keychains, showing off our 3D printer there.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   So you have a little bit of a demonstration.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:37.840]   There are some other ones that do paper crafts or do soldering or showing off quadcopters,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.920]   doing demos, things like that.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:45.760]   And really, it's just an opportunity to get sort of market and see what's out there in
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.160]   your local area, see what kind of makerspaces are there, if there are any ones that you
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.480]   can participate in for free or if they're offering classes or anything like that.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.440]   And it's a really brilliant way to meet other people who are interested in the same
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.080]   things as well.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.480]   What's your vision long-term for your space?
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.920]   I know it's a relatively small space square footage-wise, but do you guys have a long-term
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.440]   vision for what you're trying to accomplish?
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.560]   Yeah, I would say that hopefully within the next couple years we expand.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:26.320]   I'd really like for us to get a bigger space, and I know that the rest of the members are
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.760]   itching to get more tools in the space already.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.480]   But of course, you have to observe a certain amount of clearance around all of the woodworking
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.360]   tools especially.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.160]   So getting a bigger space would be great.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:46.240]   Overall, because Southside Hackerspace is really focused on continued education and
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:54.560]   STEM plus, a lot of what we want to do is to offer more free classes to the public to
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.600]   get them in through the doors and to get them exposed to that.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:05.440]   So I hope that in the future we might even be able to hook up with other hackerspaces
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:13.200]   and get involved with having them come in and give talks as well, us going over there.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.440]   We do a little bit of that now with the Northside Hackerspace called Pumping Station One.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:26.240]   Bigger is what I'm shooting for right now is Chicago and then Illinois and then the
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.040]   United States.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.560]   It's going to be really big.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.520]   Explain what you mean.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.120]   I understand STEM, let's see, the science technology.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.800]   Okay, maybe I don't.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   Engineering, mathematics, something like that.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.400]   What are you trying to do when you say STEM plus?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.600]   What exactly is the change that you're working to affect?
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:57.040]   What I'm focusing on is using the hackerspace as a safe environment for people who don't
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   have exposure to those fields of study in their own schools and being able to almost
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.520]   supplement the education that they're getting right now.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:15.920]   I think overall it's going to really challenge the way people think about education in general.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.120]   There's still homeschooling, there's Montessori school, there's public schools, there's
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.000]   private schools.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:30.240]   Who's to say that in the future maybe a child will get all of their schooling from
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.800]   a hackerspace or some combination of multiple things?
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:41.600]   I think that it's really a fantastic way to figure out where your passion really is.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.520]   If you find that you're not getting enough exposure to technology or engineering in your
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:53.680]   school, then seeking it out yourself enables you to become an advocate for yourself in
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.720]   the educational world.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.400]   I'd love to see that model explored.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:05.440]   One of the things I think we'd probably do a poor job with is making science applicable.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:14.080]   It's one thing to study mathematics and to figure out how to add and divide fractions
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.360]   and to do it in isolation.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.120]   But if you're building a bird feeder or doing some introductory woodworking project,
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.400]   and as part of that you have to learn how to navigate these fractions, now you have
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.440]   a reason to learn the actual math behind it.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.280]   You have a reason if you're interested in studying engineering, if you're working on
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.360]   something with a 3D printer or you're trying to make a CAD design, you have a reason.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:44.880]   To me, that can be so valuable because what seems to be missing in so much of schooling
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.240]   is context.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.320]   There's little context for the information.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.760]   It's not connected to anything.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.000]   It's presented in a disjointed manner.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.080]   You just go from subject to subject to subject and there's very little practical application
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.320]   of it.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.520]   But if you can flip it and you can focus on practical application, now let's learn what
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.400]   we need to do to lean to know of the theory in order to really understand the practical
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.840]   application, you have a much more powerful model of education.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.480]   Exactly.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   Is there any resources for people who are interested, who might be interested in finding
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.040]   a hackerspace, anything beyond just a web search?
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.360]   Because that's about all I've ever done is look on Meetup and do web searches.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.880]   But are there any listings, directories, websites that are joining the industry together?
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:37.200]   I think that a lot of hackerspaces are trying to keep hackerspaces.org updated as much as
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.680]   possible.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.960]   It kind of fell by the wayside for a while.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.680]   And since it's got so many hackerspaces listed on there internationally, it's really only
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.280]   keeping track of the ones that are updating more frequently.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.000]   So there could be hackerspaces that just haven't taken the time to update on that website,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.680]   but they are in your local area.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.400]   I would encourage people to do is to check out the local library.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.000]   Even if they don't have a hackerspace there, they might know the connections.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.680]   And asking friends and family and getting exposed, a lot of the hackerspaces in Chicago
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.240]   anyway, you just walk around and you could pass by and discover one.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.680]   They are kind of known to be a little bit hidden.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:32.320]   But there are definitely communities that you can, I would say, like you're doing on
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.200]   Meetup, Reddit, even for your specific city, they might post in there.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.440]   We've done that a couple of times on our Chicago.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.040]   And then all of the social networking, we utilize Facebook a lot.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   We have our own web page that we try and update.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:58.320]   And a lot of the colleges too, I should think, because students will come out of the university
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.240]   and some of them will have, like us, the idea to start a space.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.160]   So you could even tap alumni association at your local university.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.360]   Very cool.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:13.840]   So final question, if you were going to leave us today with a charge to kind of share your
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.720]   vision of why you'd like to get people involved in what you're doing locally and why you'd
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:26.560]   like to get other people involved in their location, what would be your kind of closing
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.800]   rallying cry for the hackerspace movement?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.480]   I think that a lot of what it comes down to, everything that we've been talking about,
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.400]   education and about being an advocate for yourself.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:47.760]   This is the kind of legacy that you teach and you give your, you know, lead the way
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.640]   for your children.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.480]   In architecture and design school, one of the things that I learned was that your first
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.560]   try is really far from your masterpiece.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.400]   You have to fight constantly for your ideas and you watch them get broken and you have
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.920]   to put them back together.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:12.400]   But being us is the most rewarding thing you can do for yourself.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.120]   It's the best thing that you can teach yourself and to feel good about because, you know,
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.680]   coming back to this idea of business incubator, it being a business incubator, what makes
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:28.160]   a good business, in my opinion, is passion, it's dedication, it's a need or an audience
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.320]   and churning out that refined product that you're really, really proud of.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:39.680]   Those are the things that you learn when you focus on making education something applicable
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.160]   to you.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.520]   So I guess I would challenge people, your listeners, to think about how a hackerspace
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.360]   or a makerspace can really help them personally and help the people around them because I
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.040]   think that that's what we have to focus on in order to improve the way we live our lives.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.480]   - Jessica, thanks for making the time to come on.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.600]   I've enjoyed talking with you.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.640]   - Thank you so much.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.960]   - Here's my question for you.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.160]   Could your community benefit from that type of, I guess, facility?
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:17.920]   I know mine could and I would very much love to have one of these in my area.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.000]   If any of the listeners are here in South Florida, I don't know, maybe I can get together
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.240]   with you.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:22.720]   I've looked around.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.800]   This is one of those projects that I would dearly love.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.280]   If I were financially independent and I had the money to put behind this and was willing
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.200]   to allocate towards this right now, I would dearly love to get this started here in my
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.600]   area.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.040]   There's such a need, such a need in our communities.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.160]   And if any of you have an interest in helping other people find a community that doesn't
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.160]   have access to this kind of thing, I mean, in my community, there are so many neighborhoods
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.080]   that could just benefit from somebody coming in and opening up a warehouse where people
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.440]   can just simply tinker and do stuff and make stuff.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.320]   And we've got to keep the ability to create things.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.520]   We've got to keep the ability to use our hands and to understand how things fit together.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.840]   And this is such an important thing because when you take the power of, I mean, the technological
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.920]   revolution is powerful.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.200]   The ability to simply have new technologies as governed by bits and bytes is powerful.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.480]   But you know what's even more powerful?
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.280]   When you connect those things to physical stuff.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   Because we live in a physical world, a material world, and we need to have these things connected.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.600]   So make sure, go online, check out some information on hackerspaces and makerspaces and just look
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.200]   and look around in your community.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.800]   See if anybody's getting started with one of these.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.680]   See if you can chip in.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.720]   See if something's available.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.320]   And I hope to hear from several of you at least who maybe can help sponsor something
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.960]   like this going forward in your communities.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.160]   That would thrill me.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.920]   So go and get busy, I guess.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.080]   Thanks so much for listening today.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.800]   I appreciate so much your time and attention.

[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:01.680]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:08.560]   But your situation is unique, and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.360]   anything about you.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:17.840]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:24.080]   trustworthy, and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:30.160]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.840]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.280]   person and I make mistakes.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.240]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please help me by coming to the show
