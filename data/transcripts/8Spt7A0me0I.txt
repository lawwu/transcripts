[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   Welcome back to the podcast. Tomorrow marks the 506th celebration of Reformation Day,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.560]   commemorating October 31st, when Martin Luther fearlessly published his 95 Theses, mailed
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480]   one copy to the archbishop, and then posted another copy on a prominent church door for
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.600]   everyone to read. And whether it was dramatically nailed to that door with a hammer or more
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.840]   likely glued to the door with a paste brush, Luther's document set in motion a wave of
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.280]   reformation that we honor half a millennium later.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   But given how much time has elapsed since this event, we can find ourselves questioning
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.400]   what exactly we're celebrating each year. Is it the profound recovery of the truth of
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.020]   justification by faith alone, in Christ alone? Is it the liberation of the Bible into the
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.320]   language of the people? Is it the end of indulgences, the rejection of papal authority, the dismantling
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.360]   of the priest class as mediators between God and man? Or perhaps is it all of these things
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.560]   all combined, Pastor John, as you honor the enduring legacy of the Reformation? What's
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.880]   your primary cause for celebration?
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.320]   Let me fudge on the word "primarily." I'd like to replace it with five other words,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.120]   but I couldn't think of five other words. But I did think of five other questions. I
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.720]   just couldn't think of words to go with them. I thought of two, but I gave up on five words.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.960]   So I'm going to replace your question with five, but I will at the end, I think, answer
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.240]   exactly what you're asking. So here we go. First, what am I celebrating ultimately? That
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.100]   is, what's at the top as the goal of all things when I celebrate the Reformation? And the
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.360]   answer is the glory of Jesus Christ. In Calvin's response to the Roman Catholic Sadulei, he
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.880]   said, "You touch upon justification by faith, the first and keenest subject of controversy
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:16.080]   between us. Wherever the knowledge of it is taken away, the glory of Christ is extinguished."
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.340]   I think the same point could be made on issue after issue in the disputes of the Reformation.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.140]   So ultimately, we celebrate the exaltation of the glory of Christ. Second, what am I
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.460]   celebrating most foundationally? So the first one was most ultimately. Second, most foundationally,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.540]   that is, what's at the bottom as the ground of all things when I celebrate the Reformation?
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.420]   And the answer is the free and sovereign grace of God. When Martin Luther came to the end
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.140]   of his life, he regarded his book, The Bondage of the Will, as his most important work. And
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.220]   the reason is because he regarded the issue of human autonomy versus sovereign grace as
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.700]   the key underlying issue of the Reformation. He said, "I condemn and reject as nothing
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.860]   but error all doctrines which exalt our free will as being directly opposed to this mediation
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:32.160]   and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. For since apart from Christ, sin and death are our masters
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.660]   and the devil is our God and prince, there can be no strength or power, no wit or wisdom
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.580]   by which we can fit or fashion ourselves for righteousness and life." Which means that
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:56.960]   as long as someone insists on ultimate human self-determination, they fail to grasp the
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:05.200]   depth of our need and they obscure the greatness of the free and sovereign grace of God, which
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.680]   alone can give life and faith. So I'm going to celebrate that as bottom. That's the bottom.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.380]   Third, between the glory of Christ at the top and the free and sovereign grace of God
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:29.940]   at the bottom, what am I celebrating in between as the greatest achievement of God flowing
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.580]   from grace leading to glory? And the answer is the decisive achievement of the cross of
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.960]   Christ in providing peace with God for guilty sinners. Four times, four times in the book
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.460]   of Hebrews, the author underlines and emphasizes the work of Christ in the forgiveness of sins
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:05.280]   as once for all. I love this phrase and the way he uses it. Hebrews 7.27, 9.26, 10.10.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:13.600]   He has, this is the first one, 7.27, he has no need, Christ does, like those high priests
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.440]   who offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, then for those of the people, since
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.640]   he did this once for all when he offered up himself. So I will be celebrating that the
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:37.320]   finished and complete work of Christ in providing imputed punishment for our sins and imputed
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:45.780]   perfection for our righteousness was once for all and cannot be reenacted in the Roman
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.440]   Catholic mass so as to become a necessary point of transfer of that decisive grace purchased
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:01.560]   once for all for us and given to us through faith in Christ alone. Fourth question, between
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.000]   the glory of Christ at the top and the free and sovereign grace of God at the bottom,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.360]   what am I celebrating in between as the decisive means of my enjoyment of peace with God that
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   Christ achieved? Answer, the inspired Word of God in Scripture read and known by every
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.320]   Christian. The church of the Middle Ages cut people off from the Word of God. They had
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:42.800]   done so intentionally. It was a capital crime in the 1400s in Britain to translate the Scriptures
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.440]   into English so people could read it. They burned people alive for reading fragments
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:57.160]   of the English Bible, even children. They believed that God did not offer his fellowship
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   to be enjoyed through a personal encounter with him in his Word, but rather through the
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.240]   ministry of priests and sacraments. This was evil. And the chasm created between Scripture
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:22.600]   and the people of God has not been closed to this very day. I've mentioned before my
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:29.320]   experience in Europe where a nun was converted at 80 years old and had never read the Gospel
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.440]   of John. So a Roman Catholic professional religious woman never had read the Gospel
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:43.920]   of John. That is symptomatic of a deep evil in cutting people off historically and today
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:53.120]   doing things that subtly discourage the personal encounter with God through Christ in his Word.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:01.280]   So I will be celebrating the personal preciousness and access to the Word of God for my daily
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:09.040]   means of enjoying personal fellowship with my Father in heaven. And the last question,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:18.160]   what great Reformation truth will I be celebrating concerning how I experience the living Christ
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:28.720]   through his Word? Answer, I will be celebrating the truth that faith acted directly on Christ
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:36.480]   through his Word, not mediated by priestly sacraments, is the decisive primary way I
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:43.400]   enjoy what Christ purchased and what the Word makes possible.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.520]   Here's what I read this morning, Tony, in my devotions that made my heart sing. I was
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:57.080]   reading in Ephesians 3 and that unspeakably great prayer where Paul says, "I pray according
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.600]   to the riches of his glory that he may grant you to be strengthened with power through
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:13.400]   his Spirit in the inner man so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith." That's
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:22.220]   amazing. Christ dwells. Now this is a prayer for Christians. This is not a prayer for conversion.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.080]   We think, "Oh, that means Christ knocks on the door and comes in." That's not. He's
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:34.180]   in. He's in. We are Christians. He's praying for saints in Ephesus that Christ would dwell,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:44.160]   that is consciously alive, present, at home, experienced. How? Through faith so that Christ
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:51.780]   may dwell in your heart through faith. He's praying for Christians who already have Christ.
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:10:01.200]   This is a prayer for real, authentic experience of the living Christ. So when I embrace the
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:10.840]   crucified and risen Christ as my supreme treasure, alive, present, at home, in me, that very
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:21.380]   faith, that embrace, that faith is the sufficient instrument for the enjoyment of his fellowship.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.120]   That will be my primary daily celebration.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:32.560]   Yeah, amen. Opening a Bible in our native language, reading and studying it, and encountering
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.240]   the real, authentic experience of the living Christ. It's the best way to honor such a
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.080]   day. Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for joining us today. If you want to ask Pastor
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.760]   John, type out your question as briefly as possible and email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:00.780]   Selfishness. It's the antithesis of Christ and the antithesis of the holy Christian life.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:07.040]   Yet despite its defiance against the faith, selfish tendencies persist inside of us, leading
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.640]   one 17-year-old to earnestly seek guidance on how to cultivate selflessness.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.720]   That's up next time on Thursday. I'm your host Tony Reiki. See you then.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   [END]
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   1
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.780]   you
