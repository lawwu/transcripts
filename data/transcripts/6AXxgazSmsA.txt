[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Whatever we're struggling with,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.800]   whatever we're struggling to get started with,
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.640]   there's always a little bit of a push of energy
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.760]   that we need to get started with the thing.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.520]   Now, the question is like, how do we get there?
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.360]   Like once we've got the clarity on the thing,
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.420]   once we've tried to figure out
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.000]   what our emotions are getting in the way,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   at some points, some stuff is just kind of boring
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   and you just kind of have to do it.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.580]   So like, how do you nudge yourself to just get started?
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.420]   At this point, you know,
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.040]   some people would say that motivation is a thing.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.720]   And so like, you got to motivate yourself to do it.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.880]   You got to like really want it.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.600]   You got to want it so much that you can't breathe
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.960]   or whatever these motivational videos say.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.080]   And that's fine.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.920]   But like, there's a great book by Jeff Hayden
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.520]   called "The Motivation Myth,"
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.800]   which basically argues that like,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.840]   motivation is a bit of a myth.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.500]   Like, we don't summon up the motivation magically
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.520]   to do a thing.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.560]   We do the thing.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.580]   And by seeing a small success,
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.280]   that then helps us summon the motivation
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.160]   to continue to do the thing.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.600]   And so really, motivation doesn't lead to action.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.280]   Action leads to motivation.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.840]   And so understanding that I think was a big,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.200]   big unlock for me that like, really,
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.040]   just because I don't feel like doing something
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.000]   doesn't actually stop me from doing the thing.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.620]   And therefore, I can just do it.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.120]   And sometimes that works where I just tell myself that like,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.860]   I could just get out of bed right now,
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.080]   even though I don't feel like it.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.440]   Oh, that's like the motivation approach.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.760]   And you've got like the discipline approach,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.040]   the willpower approach, the David Goggins approach of like,
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.620]   well, if you're not doing it at that point,
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.460]   you're just soft.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.040]   You just got to, you know, use the willpower.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.800]   You've got to use grit, determination, discipline
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.960]   to kind of push through and do the thing.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.840]   That's fine as well, that works.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.200]   The thing that I personally like to do
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.700]   is I like to tell myself,
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.600]   I'm just going to do the thing for two minutes
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.280]   and then I'm going to stop doing the thing.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.260]   So I've got a couple of songs on my Spotify playlist,
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.360]   which are like two minutes long, like instrumental songs.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.440]   I'm just like, if I, yeah,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.960]   I'll just like put on one of the songs.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.960]   I'll be like, I'm just going to do this thing
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   until the end of the song.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.080]   And usually the song ends, the next one plays on shuffle.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.920]   And I don't even realize
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.400]   that I've just continued doing the thing.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.860]   Occasionally I just do it for two minutes
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.440]   and then I stop and I think, cool, that's fine.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.280]   That's not my day.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.460]   But I say 90% of the time,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.720]   as long as I can just talk myself
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.120]   into doing it for two minutes,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.280]   then I'm unlikely to stop doing it
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.760]   because once I've gotten to the swing of things,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.760]   it's a lot easier to get started.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.640]   And I guess my kind of final kind of point on this is,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.580]   if all else fails, something that will never fail
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.040]   is actually putting money on the line.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   So I know, you know, my friend Thomas Frank
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.000]   is this huge YouTuber, two and a half million subscribers.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.680]   The way he motivated himself to publish videos
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.720]   in the early days of his channel,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.080]   when no one was watching,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.940]   was an app called Beeminder,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.200]   which is an automatic thing
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.760]   where it like connects to your YouTube RSS feed.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   And if you don't publish a video every week,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960]   it will take $30 out of your debit card
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.800]   or out of your bank account,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.040]   just completely automatically.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.200]   And that was how he made himself accountable.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.720]   He's like, well, I've got to publish a video every week,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.100]   otherwise I'm losing $30.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.520]   Now, depending on who you are,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.460]   $30 might not seem like enough money,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.380]   but it needs to be enough money to sting.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.920]   So one thing that I've actually tried in the past
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.680]   is giving my housemate 1,000 pounds and saying,
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680]   if I don't do this thing,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   you get to keep the 1,000 pounds.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.880]   And that has just worked magically
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   for me to do absolutely anything.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.620]   I don't like using it all the time.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.900]   I'd much rather use all these other nicer methods,
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.300]   but that is a fail safe.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.000]   If I'm ever really struggling to do a thing
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.240]   that I know I have to do,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.080]   like write 1,000 pounds, transfer the money,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.160]   and they can always give it back to me
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.480]   once I've done the thing.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.920]   - It probably depends on the circumstance.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.280]   I was running today with our daughter in a stroller,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.680]   which, by the way, for anyone who doesn't have kids,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   once you start running with a child,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.400]   you're like, I'm now a horrible runner.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.520]   Like I've taken like 10 steps back
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.160]   because I'm now pushing this stroller
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.280]   and I just can't run as fast.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.040]   I use the Goggins approach, which is like,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.520]   am I really gonna tell myself
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.000]   that I can't just make it to the end of this neighborhood?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.880]   Like, I really can't do that.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.720]   That works really well,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.360]   but I don't think that works as well
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.840]   when you're like sitting down at your desk
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.100]   to complete a task.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.600]   So having all the tools is probably pretty helpful.
