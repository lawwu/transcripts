[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   All right, next up, Joe Lonsdale.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   We go.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.000]   Joe Lonsdale's going to come up.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.020]   He's going to tee it up for about five or ten minutes in a solo dolo.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.540]   He told me he's burning the house down.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.760]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.620]   Rain Man, David Sack.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.360]   And it's said, we open sourced it to the fans, and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.980]   Love you, man.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.760]   He's the queen of quinoa.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.500]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.680]   Well, hello, Miami.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.700]   It's good to be here from Austin for a day.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.320]   We're the second best tech city here.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.060]   It's not too bad.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.280]   How many people actually live in Miami?
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.900]   I'm curious.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.500]   There's a crowd.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.220]   We've been over that.
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.200]   So everyone's flown in town like me.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.160]   Well, you know, I'm generally an American optimist, but I want to talk about a lot of
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600]   stuff that's broken right now that we know how to fix, but we aren't.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.680]   And, you know, talking to these guys, especially hearing from Elon and everyone today, it's
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.300]   just so exciting.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.700]   What are some?
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.040]   Civilization is going towards what it could be doing.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.740]   But if you talk to a lot of our smartest friends, you look at guys like Dahlia or Bridgewater
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.580]   and others, you know, they see America in decline.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.400]   They see decadence.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.540]   They see decay.
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.800]   And I think there's a lot of important questions we're facing right now.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.320]   Why do these happen to a civilization?
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.680]   Why, when there's so many exciting things going on that we know can make a really great
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.020]   future for our kids and grandkids and for humanity, why is this stuff breaking?
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960]   And I want to tell you a little story.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.860]   I have a policy group in Austin, and we follow the homeless population there.
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.720]   And we're going along with a middle-aged Mexican gentleman who had just lost his job, and he
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.640]   went into the homeless center.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.980]   He's really struggling.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.300]   And he says, you know, I really want to try to find a job.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.260]   I want some job training.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.720]   And the person working there, she says, you know, sir, you deserve a home.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.960]   And he said, yeah, that's great, but can I get some training?
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.300]   And she said, you don't need to worry about that.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.340]   You need to worry about getting a home for people just like you and what you deserve.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.480]   And I want to back up about the situation in Austin, because we're seeing this all over
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.300]   the country right now.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.740]   You know, in 2018, the mayor of Austin went to San Francisco and L.A.
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.220]   And, you know, he was asking them for advice on what to do for homelessness.
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.640]   There wasn't really homelessness downtown.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.180]   It's funny.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.220]   This is funny to me, too.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.640]   But there's actually a reason he was asking them for advice.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.520]   And it's a special interest thing where there's actually hundreds of millions of funding that
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.480]   goes to these groups, NSF and L.A., that work on this, and to all of their friends and to
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.560]   all the people with their politics.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.920]   And it's a huge money spigot for politicians, because they're very powerful in those other
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.180]   cities.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.440]   In Austin, they didn't have that money spigot, and he wanted it.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.940]   And you know what they told him?
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.880]   I heard this from both sides.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660]   He said, you know, you have to show people that capitalism doesn't work.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.680]   And he said, you know, you have to show people that capitalism doesn't work.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.760]   You've got to put it in their faces, and then you'll get funding.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.200]   And he went back to Austin, and he brought all the camps downtown.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.760]   Homeless deaths spiked.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.800]   Homeless trafficking spiked.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.700]   Sex trafficking spiked.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.320]   Drugs spiked.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.060]   But the funding went way up for him and his friends.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.480]   They got massive new funding, you know, unaccountable sources of money for these people.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.640]   And then, of course, they start deploying the answers, which is the Housing First strategy.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.420]   And by the way, this is not just like a right versus left thing.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.860]   I think Housing First was first deployed under W. Bush.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.080]   So this is a general strategy.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.460]   You guys probably know in L.A., they spend...
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.800]   $800,000 per new home trying to solve this problem.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   There's 7,000 nonprofits right now, you know, funded by HUD around our country with the same philosophy.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.600]   And the philosophy is no pay for performance, no transparency, no accountability, just build the homes.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.760]   And, you know, when I first heard about this a decade ago, I thought, wow, that makes sense.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.100]   There's 5,000 homeless people.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.500]   Let's build 5,000 homes.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.700]   It turns out that there's still about a couple percent of our society that really don't have a home,
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.060]   but they're living kind of on the edge on people's couches, with other family, with friends.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.200]   So the actual demand for housing is...
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.700]   I mean, it turns out maybe it's about 6 million, 10 million.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.640]   It's effectively infinite.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.540]   There's infinite demand for homes in our society.
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.440]   And who do you think gets these homes when we build them?
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.160]   So this guy, we were following, you know, a few hundred people with my philanthropy group,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.500]   and our team goes back in with him.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.640]   And he gets in line, and he's been leaving between a camp that they helped him set up in downtown
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.400]   and a relative's house, but he's, you know, he's saying he's living outside in camp.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.460]   And he goes back, and he just missed getting a home, and he's frustrated.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.960]   And they're explaining the points to him, and he says, "Wait a second.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.940]   So you're saying that if I was on drugs, I would qualify
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.940]   for a home?"
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.040]   And they said, "Well, we don't like to say it that way, but that's true."
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.080]   And he says, "You're saying if I committed a crime, I'd qualify for a home."
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.680]   And they're like, "Well, yeah, but that's...
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   Yeah, we don't like to say it that way, but that's true.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.040]   That would have given you enough points to qualify for a home."
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.660]   And what happens here, if you try to bait this system, you know, 7,000 of these groups
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.060]   around the country, you're screamed at as a racist, you're screamed at with ad hominem
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.060]   attacks.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.060]   There's three things.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.060]   One, there's not the intellectual humility to see that there may be other answers that
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060]   may be correct.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.680]   Two, there's no respect for the dignity of...
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.180]   Of everyone in this conversation.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.560]   If you disagree, you are a bad person.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.760]   And three, there's no passion for the truth.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.680]   These people are not trying to pursue the truth.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.620]   These people already have the truth, and they're giving it to you as a dogma.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.080]   And this is true of pretty much every of these broken areas in our society, and there's a
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   lot of them.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080]   There's a lot of them right now.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.920]   There's, like, we have 50 training programs that we spend a lot of money on the federal
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   government.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   They're not accountable.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   They don't tend to work.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   They're very broken.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   There's no transparency.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   There's no competition.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   There's no debate.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   You're for it or against it.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.420]   And you're a bad person if you're against it.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.120]   There's these vocational schools around the country.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   Texas vocational schools were really underperforming seven years ago.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.740]   And what we did is we ended up actually changing them so that the schools were only going to
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.300]   be funded based on the salaries of the students coming out.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.840]   If you tie it to graduation rates, it doesn't work because they can graduate everyone.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   We tied to the salaries coming out.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.320]   We got the salaries coming out to go up 117% just by putting in that accountability.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.620]   But most of the country doesn't do that.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.200]   Most of the country, there's vocational schools.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   People go.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.160]   Very low graduation rates.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   They fail.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.900]   They fail.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.700]   We're not going to go into the K-12 issues you guys know about.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.680]   But one fact most people don't know is the education inequality in this country is far
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.640]   greater than the wealth inequality.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   Far greater.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.760]   So there's, I mean, you know, and you guys probably see there's an infant formula production
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.900]   thing which is a crisis right now.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.180]   There's really basic policy mistakes around that.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.780]   The way we run our prisons, our probation and parole, there's all sorts of ways to run
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.780]   them much better.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.780]   We're not doing it though.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.400]   You know, I'll give you one other example because Elon was speaking today.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   Austin Infrastructure.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.900]   I'm very excited about his boring company.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.900]   And, you know, in Austin, we passed the law.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.780]   We passed the $6 billion, $7 billion plan to build a really small amount of infrastructure.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.460]   It's already ballooning cost of $12 billion.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.400]   For less than half the original money, for $3 billion, you could do over 100 times as
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.600]   many tunnels in terms of what they're building right now.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.400]   And you do it with 100 more stations.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   And so basically for a tiny fraction of the cost, and again, I go and talk to the city
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   and talk to the guys.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   There's no intellectual humility.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.240]   They don't respect your dignity.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.240]   Elon's a bad guy.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.640]   We don't like Elon, whatever.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.400]   I'm kind of extreme version.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.920]   And they're not interested in the truth.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   They're really not.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.080]   They're just interested in what they're going to do their way.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.800]   And so can you kind of come back to this?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.140]   What's going on in our society?
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.140]   Where is this coming from?
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.840]   And, you know, say what causes decadence, decay, and decline?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.560]   I think the more important question is what actually works?
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.480]   Why is our society functional?
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.240]   And I think you have to take it back to the Enlightenment, right?
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.440]   If you look at the exponential growth that's happened, that's created the wealth that all
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   of us enjoy, it really happened over the last few centuries, kind of post-Enlightenment.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.380]   And you had a society that really...
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.720]   A society that really cared about pursuit of the truth, really cared about competition
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   of ideas, right?
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.180]   I mean, and you need the virtues for this to work, right?
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.380]   The classical virtues that we talk about in our civilization, justice, wisdom, temperance,
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.380]   courage.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.800]   You need the courage to actually fight for the truth.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.600]   And so a long time ago, you tended to have religious dogma, which could be some form
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.260]   of virtue signaling, some form of, you know, basically keeping out outsiders.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.600]   And then you had separately debate and substance.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.120]   And debate and substance generally lost to religious dogma.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   And what was unique about it was that it was a kind of a...
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   It was unique about the Enlightenment.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   What was unique about our university system, which we created, was the liberal universities
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.560]   were a place to have debates where substance could actually win against, you know, dogma
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.960]   and against, you know, people who disagree.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.560]   You actually had to disagree civilly and you actually had to pursue truth.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.340]   You had to have the intellectual humility to know that you don't have all the answers.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.460]   You had to respect the dignity of people who are debating and you had to fight for a passion
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.780]   for the truth.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.860]   And what's happened instead is that most of our universities have been conquered.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.560]   Conquered by dogma and by religion.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.020]   They no longer have these things.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.480]   So once again, we have the idea of heretics and blasphemy.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   We don't call that...
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.800]   We don't use those words, but that's what we're facing right now.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.580]   If you disagree with people, you're a heretic and you're committing blasphemy.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.800]   If you speak against all sorts of these things you're not supposed to speak against.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.660]   If you say that DEI is actually causing problems, if you say that here's why ESG is wrong, that's
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.660]   like it's blasphemous.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.660]   You're not...
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.660]   This isn't your stuff.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.660]   You're not allowed to attack these days.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.660]   You're in trouble.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.860]   You're told not to speak against it again or else you're fired.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.860]   There's been written about...
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.540]   I'm talking about lots of corporations right now.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.360]   This happens to all sorts of people.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.100]   And this is happening first and foremost on our campus.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.820]   What's happened is this zero-sum, historically illiterate, intolerant, virtue signaling religion
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.700]   has completely taken over and is silencing people.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.300]   And our founders were quite fond of heretics.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.960]   I don't know if people realize that, but that was kind of the equivalent debate 300 years
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.500]   ago to this woke religion is that Benjamin Franklin, he said, "I think all heretics I
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.640]   have known have been virtuous men.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.940]   They have the virtue of courage."
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.600]   Or they wouldn't...
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   They venture their heresy.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.480]   They cannot afford to be deficient in other virtues due to the numerous enemies they provoke.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.900]   And so I think thinking what's going on here, all of us, first of all, need to go back and
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.740]   think about where do we not have enough humility to try to learn more?
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   Where are we not respecting people who disagree and actually engaging them and debating them
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.720]   as opposed to calling them names, running them off?
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.680]   And frankly, I think we should also remember it's actually really good to be offended.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.820]   It's the opposite of safe spaces.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.120]   There's this weird cultural thing with the millennial generation, I guess I'm barely
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.740]   part of it, unfortunately, where you're basically supposed to protect people from being offended.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.480]   You're supposed to protect them from blasphemy.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.620]   I think it has to be the opposite if our civilization is not going to decline.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.840]   I think we actually have to go out of our way to learn that when we're offended, we
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   have to be stronger.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.600]   It doesn't mean you're somehow elevated as a victim if you're offended.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.160]   That's your problem if you're offended and you just stop and think about it.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.620]   And we need to use that to advance our civilization again.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.520]   So that's my statement.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   That's my statement for today.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:07.820]   Jason wanted me to add a bunch more blasphemy, but I'm going to hold off on that.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.820]   I think you did enough.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.820]   I think you did enough.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.820]   Let's talk.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.820]   Let's chop it up.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.820]   Get in here.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.120]   Let's talk about why people feel like they're victims.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.360]   What do you think in our country makes certain people feel that they're victims?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   What are the reasons that people feel that they've been victims?
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   What are the valid reasons people might feel that they have gotten a raw deal in America?
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   I mean, I think all of our ancestors have gone through this.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   I'm Jewish and Irish.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   When my ancestors came over, there were signs saying no dogs are Irish allowed.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   My grandfather was only promoted to a certain level at Abbott because he was a Jew.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   I actually didn't realize they'd hired a Jew and they laughed and said, oops, that
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360]   was a mistake.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   You can only get to this level.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   And so, I mean, I think there has been some pretty horrible things everywhere in the world,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.360]   frankly, not just America.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.360]   I think everywhere you look, there's always been groups that have been victimized.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   I think that's the problem.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   I think that's the problem.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.340]   been groups that have been treated pretty badly. I'm Irish as well. Irish need not apply. We had
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.100]   a pretty horrific famine. And I'm lucky. And it's obviously a lot easier to be Irish than it is to
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.840]   be someone who's black in America. Or Jewish and the Holocaust. Yeah. So you would agree
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.780]   different people's experiences are on a spectrum of the suffering, correct? 100%.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:22.340]   And so people who've suffered more deserve a little more empathy and perhaps a little bit more
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.500]   consideration. They deserve more empathy, but it doesn't mean you should embrace
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.740]   philosophies that are wrong or harmful, right? So I mean, if you look at the, obviously,
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.780]   there's a lot of truth and positive parts of the BLM movement the last couple years,
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.180]   but it's actually led to thousands more deaths in the black community because of the things that it
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.660]   was pushing, because of the bad ideas. We got another one of these things?
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.320]   Yeah, one more, one more. How many more of these do we got to do?
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.120]   This is like way more work than I thought I was signing up for. Way
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.600]   more work. Someone get this man a drink. We should have had cocktails. I never agreed to be in the
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.360]   conference business when we started doing this pod. J. Cal, I respect you for what you've been
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.900]   able to do, but this is way too much work. You guys said you wanted to do a look at,
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.040]   yeah, all these fans are here. You're doing the Q&A tomorrow. Okay, sounds good. I think,
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:21.900]   you know, Joe, candidly, I think that is where the argument breaks down a bit is people have
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:29.260]   had different experiences, and I would disagree that people have to stop thinking like victims.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.340]   I think sometimes we have to think very deeply about the suffering people have had, especially
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:41.340]   when it's different than the suffering that you and I have had. And I'm not virtue signaling here.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.820]   I'm just countering the argument. I think that's fully true. What I was reeling against is I gave
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.300]   10 examples of ways in which our society is broken and hurting poor people, hurting working class people,
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.680]   Sure. like the waste
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.400]   and wasting money on things in dysfunctional ways. And all of that is happening because we're like
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.760]   going to this illiberal society where we're not able to actually like debate things logically.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.080]   Sure. And respect other people on the other side of the argument. And it's all about
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.760]   demonizing people who disagree with us. Yeah.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.160]   Right. And I think that's just really, really scary right now.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   Do you, there's a website, people have tweeted this, I think the website is called
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.400]   whatthefuckhappenedin1971.com. Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.460]   Yeah. Where if you
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.780]   go to this website. I don't. Tell me.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.820]   So in 19, if you look back socioeconomically, there's a whole bunch of charts and graphs of
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:36.020]   everything from GDP to, you know, labor participation rates, et cetera. And there is a
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.900]   moment in 1971 where just trend lines break. And, you know, Dorsey tweeted this out a little while
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.260]   ago. A bunch of people have talked about it and everybody has tried to figure out what actually
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.240]   happened in 19-- I mean, there's a couple of really good explanations, I think, right?
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.480]   Yeah. But I think the two biggest ones, I think the two biggest ones by far is one is tech driven
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.880]   globalization. And the other one is going off the gold currency, which over-financialized the economy.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.400]   Yeah. So I think the gold currency one was important. I think the one that people don't
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.640]   talk about, whether you agree with it or not, I'd love to get your perspective is, you know,
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:14.440]   the move to the Great Society had a whole bunch of things that I think were meant to do meaningful
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.840]   good. And I-- And then broke down the family as well, which is a huge problem in America.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.020]   Yeah. And this is, yeah. So, I mean, we talk about things that, you know, we talk about things that,
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.220]   you know, we talk about things that make civilization prosper. I think you get the
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.620]   classical virtues and you get a strong families, which by the way, for whatever reason, I still
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.860]   can't tell BLM was strongly against, which I think is like just horrible. So I think it is a problem
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.060]   in the white community as well, by the way. It's like almost half of kids are born out of wedlock
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.940]   right now. And if you statistically look at that, those kids just on average vastly underperform.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.140]   This doesn't mean to say there's aren't one-off cases and you should get divorced if it's the
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.620]   right thing to do. But it's like it's really bad for society as a whole statistically. You can't
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.800]   argue against that. And exactly. We've accidentally created
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.620]   the incentives towards divorce in the 1960s, which obviously wasn't intentional, but this is
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.500]   a huge problem. We're not supposed to talk about it. It's like a conservative thing, I guess.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:03.420]   And talk about the financialization and moving off the gold standard as well. How did that
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.900]   change socioeconomic dynamics in America? Well, basically, it made it so there's like
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:14.620]   a lot more money around. And so I think it put more returns into finance. So I benefit from this
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:20.580]   as do you as an investor. But making things. Yeah. I think it put more returns into
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.960]   finance and because there's this explosion of credit and money relative to so I think finance
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.400]   outperformed labor in terms of it's an advantage for finance, which is not what you necessarily
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.920]   want. It also really, really helped accelerate tech driven globalization, which probably was good for
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.320]   India and China and Southeast Asia and even Africa. But it basically forced workers in the
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.400]   US to compete against all these people directly. And so you had people paid like 15 times as much
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.360]   in the US, these other people. And then it just wasn't sustainable. So over time, you know, you're
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.040]   time these other people out competed about over the last 50 years which is really tough
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:02.280]   you you find it hard to find your tribe in silicon valley oh yeah intellectually has it become easier
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.560]   harder the same you know i i've just given up on like having even a tribe so much as like let's
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.280]   work on this together let's actually make prisons have lower risk stativism and higher employment
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.200]   and here's how we're gonna do it we're gonna put these transparency and accountability incentives
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.160]   and it's hard for anyone to really disagree with that unless you're running the prisons union
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.680]   and so like we got we're getting all these laws passed from probation and parole and that we're
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.800]   getting all these laws passed for adamant educational school work better yeah and what's
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.720]   annoys me chamath is that i feel like as people who've succeeded we all sort of have a duty to go
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:37.560]   and fix these problems and almost no one else is working on that that does annoy me um and then in
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.240]   terms of like for example i want to talk specifically because you mentioned higher ed but
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:48.120]   if you go a little bit before this um we have no real form of competition in the school system yes
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.960]   um you need to use some mechanism for good ideas to win in bad ideas and and the the existing
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.520]   framework has been charter schools um but that's been attacked under every you know sort of way
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:07.480]   shape or form how um how does that problem get solved how do we get kids um you know so so the
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.320]   problem if you just give everybody choice right now and you give them say funding take the money
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.720]   where they want it basically defunds the public schools which then hurts the poor kids the most
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.120]   uh and so i understand why people are against like total choice of schools and i think that's a good point
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   um but i think that's a good point and i think that's a good point and i think that's a good point
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   and so i understand why people are against like total choice of schools and i think that's a good point
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   and so i understand why people are against like total choice of schools and i think that's a good point
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.000]   and so i understand why people are against like total choice for everyone it's kind of just kind
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.880]   of more like policy detail i think the way to get around that is you just give the poor kids choice
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.480]   because if you just gave the poor kids choice and now it's very clear you're just doing it
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.920]   to help them but even them being able to choose will put pressure and get rid of the hurt the bad
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.440]   schools and help the good schools so you just need some mechanism let's do the mechanism through the
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.480]   poor kids because that helps them the most like that that's that's my view seems actually like
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.960]   a reasonable it's gonna compromise right because why shouldn't the i mean my kids have choice
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.320]   where to go with my with my wife and i why shouldn't poor kids have that choice so there's
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.040]   there's things that teachers you're going to have to make sure that they're going to have that choice
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.960]   you're going to hate that but at least it's a way to kind of kind of maybe build support for it and
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.160]   is there a way for unions to to actually do the the part of the job which is about protecting workers
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:02.440]   with but disentangle some of the financial incentives to aggregate you know dues participate
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.720]   actively you just got to change the power structure right now they're totally in charge
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.840]   they don't want to give an inch i get it because every time they give an inch they're going to lose
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.920]   more power later on if they see that they're losing some battles then they then they have
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.240]   to negotiate and they're going to be more reasonable they say oh yeah you're right we're
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.920]   going to get rid of the bottom 20 we're going to you know you got to get to a point where the power
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.040]   changes enough that they're willing to then work with you that's it but i mean the bigger the
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.880]   bigger thing i think is we actually need leaders who are courageous who could speak up about
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.560]   problems and in the midst of everyone yelling and screaming and saying you're not supposed to say
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.040]   things you say actually i don't care what you're not supposed to say this is my version of the
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.560]   truth and this is what's going to be the best in society and what we're teaching at universities
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.160]   right now is the opposite of that what we're teaching is joe just don't say that joe what's
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.400]   going on in the world why are you causing problems for yourself joe you know you're not
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.240]   supposed to talk about these things and i'm so sick of it because like this is why all this
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:19:00.840]   stuff's broken it's because no one's speaking up you bought a college my my friends barry weiss and
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:06.120]   neil ferguson and i uh along with a couple a bunch of others are starting a new university in austin
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.440]   yes did you buy an existing university we're just starting from a clean sheet we got 500 acres in
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.200]   the water it's really pretty it's about 15 acres of land and we're just starting from a clean sheet of paper we got 500 acres in the water it's really pretty it's about
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.760]   15 acres of land and we're just starting from a clean sheet of paper we got 500 acres in the water it's really pretty it's about
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   15 minutes from the tesla giant tesla plant about 30 minutes from downtown
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.720]   what we're going to build you teach what will the majors be and what will be the approach
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   you know the the hypothesis you know as entrepreneurs our job is to find these gaps
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.400]   in the world where something should exist but doesn't and it seems like for the first time
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.200]   in a few generations uh you could actually build a university that competes with the other very top
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.440]   universities and attracts the very you know most talented kids one of my obnoxious views on this
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.720]   which i think the stage might might might agree with just because it's in our direction
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.960]   is that used to be the smartest people in the world a lot of them became professors
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.480]   and now you get a lot of the very smartest people becoming innovators becoming builders like my
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.200]   smartest friends i got to drop out of their phds from mit and stanford and caltech actually found
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.360]   more intellectual expression and satisfaction you know in the entrepreneurship world than they did
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.520]   there and so therefore in order to compete you know you want not only the top professors but you
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.240]   want to involve a lot of top innovators and you know we want to teach you want to teach the history
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.400]   of thought in in the free civilizations you want to actually see like like how the alignment come
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.440]   about what were the books what were the debates that people were having when they're found in the
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.480]   country and kind of kind of learn that core uh and then we also want to have centers where you know
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.320]   keep it interdisciplinary it was one of the key things universities this is again somewhat technical
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.000]   but they're broken because you get these departments to get conquered by certain ideology
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.600]   so you get certain people to only allow people who think like them to be in those departments
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.360]   so you want to you want to spread it out keep it just how much of this is because of tenure
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.080]   tenure is a big problem you want to have some protection tenure originally was a great thing
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.480]   protected you to say what you want and practice now it's usually it's usually the other way around
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.200]   and it's pretty and yeah it's just not good yeah but yeah no there's there's a huge gap there i
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.880]   think we could fix it and my goal obviously is not to have everyone educated through one great
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.560]   university it's to put pressure on other universities to change and to help build
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.600]   multiple new ones which i think we need to do and the school that you start interdisciplinary by
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.360]   nature which means that not necessarily known as for technical people for mathematics there'll be
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.760]   like a center of like political economy and history there'll be a center of data science
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.560]   and innovation and you know etc there'll be centers you know of you know arts and writing
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.080]   and stuff so i think you want different there's different skills i think everyone should get the
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.600]   kind of core is this for profit or is he gonna no it's non-profit it's probably it's part of me
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.120]   wishes i made it for profit because i need to make money because it'd be easier to raise money for it
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.640]   but we've talked to him we've raised about 100 million dollars non-profit
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.200]   for it we have the land uh so i mean it's it's gonna work i put my name on it so i'll pay for
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.280]   it
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.560]   raised a hundred million dollars for this yeah the non-profit yeah we have
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:50.200]   and uh when do you plan on opening it fall of 2024 is our goal for the first class be about
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:56.360]   the size of caltech at first is the hope it's pretty ambitious project yeah well our country
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.280]   our country needs some some more leaders right now who are courageous and know the thing how do you
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.920]   how do you uh how do you how do you think you'll recruit the first class
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.120]   how do you get uh yeah you want you want to do much more active recruiting than most of
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.640]   our top colleges right now especially because we won't be as known at first but i'll tell you what
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.400]   we have a seminar this summer of 80 kids and we had 44 000 increase of from kids about it we have
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.680]   uh you know when we first the first two weeks after the story was out on twitter in november
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.920]   that we're doing this we had 4 400 professors apply because these professors are fleeing a lot
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.800]   of the professors by the way a lot of them on the moderate left they're being attacked by the
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.120]   extremes for again talking about and saying things you're not supposed to talk about and say and so
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.400]   so a lot of them are trying to fleet other environments there's a huge demand for it right
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.080]   now it's super weird that
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:45.800]   college kids yeah are against having debates and discussions so much worse i just find it so weird
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.000]   like that was like one of the best parts of college because i don't have a i mean i haven't
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.160]   been in college so the last five years have just gotten totally crazy like that like we had a woman
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.000]   professor really smart woman you know definitely on the left but like she was applying from nyu law
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.960]   school asking us are we going to do a new law school because she can't stand that anymore
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.920]   and we say well what's going on she said well for example we used to use
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.800]   a socratic method in my law school and i would ask tough questions from
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.040]   both sides of the kids and now in order not to trigger people i have to write them an email a
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.560]   week ahead of time to make sure i can ask the question and that i'm going to ask in class next
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.400]   week so if you were to ask a lawyer this is the train a lawyer i mean it's just this is this is
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:25.480]   where we are at this point so that's nyu law school this is nyu that's the policy of nyu i
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.280]   think we got a bigger cycle i don't know but like this is this our universities have just gone crazy
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.080]   the last five years like is that an isolated incident or no no y'all has more administrators
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.640]   than students these administrators are on the whole
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   more likely to be neo-marxist than to be than maybe republicans i mean it's just like these
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.840]   things have gotten very extreme what do you think sex
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:54.440]   about did you ever think you would get this bad when you were about the university and you know
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:01.000]   i mean you lived at a time i mean the time at stanford was uh a pretty bold time when
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.760]   you were there in terms of freedom of speech in terms of debate vibrancy
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.480]   yeah what basically happened is all those radicals who are being
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:14.280]   inculcated and trained and brainwashed at stanford that we were reacting to what if 25 30 years ago
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.480]   they all graduated and then they went off into society and took over all these institutions
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.760]   and that's the problem we have today matt taibbi and glenn greenwald were talking about it earlier
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.880]   today where if you actually look at polling the biggest divide in america in terms of political
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:36.360]   and cultural beliefs is whether or not you have a college degree so if you're basically a college
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.320]   graduate you remember that you're a university graduate you're a graduate graduate and you're
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.720]   a member of the professional class if you're not a college graduate you're a member of the working
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:48.120]   class that is the biggest divide and um you know the the members of the professional class by and
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:54.760]   large have very very far left views on socio-cultural issues that's just a fact i mean
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.560]   whether you agree with it or not um and that is creating a huge amount of tension in our society
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:07.160]   because two-thirds of the country is working class one-third is a professional class and in
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.240]   the middle-class it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.080]   working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.880]   it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people working class
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.120]   and in the middle-class it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class it's a lot
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.000]   of people working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people working class and in the
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.080]   middle-class it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.800]   it's a lot of people working class and in the middle-class it's a lot of people working class
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.600]   and you go down the list, they have views
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.120]   that are fundamentally in tension and in conflict
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.120]   with the views of most of the country.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.520]   The working class of the country.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.840]   Now, if you're a member of that class,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.800]   you may think it's a good thing.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.180]   We're gonna push our views onto the country,
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.320]   whether they like it or not,
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.540]   and we're gonna convert them.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.140]   - That's what you call the elite class, right?
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.280]   - That's the elite.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.180]   And that's what basically,
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.760]   now like what I'm describing is not like a criticism.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.580]   I think it's just like-
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.420]   - I think that's what Charles-
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.720]   - I think it's a factual critique of what's happening.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.780]   - Well, yeah, I don't think it's partisan either.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.300]   I mean, there are people who are Republicans or Democrats
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.140]   in both- - Right.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.740]   There are elites in both parties,
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.400]   and there are certainly working class people
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.240]   in both parties.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.840]   But what I would say is that the parties are now
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.020]   in the process of resorting around this sort of political
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.340]   and cultural divide.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.140]   And historically, the Democrats were the party
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.980]   of the working class.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.880]   They are now much more the party of the professional class.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.240]   And they buy into the belief set of sort of the college
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.700]   educated, - Right.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.860]   - the, you know, those sort of,
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.420]   you call it the woke sensibility.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.280]   And the Republicans are in the process of transforming
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.160]   into a working class sort of populist party.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.000]   - Yeah.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.140]   - And look, there are, in both parties,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.120]   there are outliers who don't quite fit in anymore.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.160]   But that's the fundamental transformation that's happening.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.000]   - Yeah.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.980]   I mean, you guys fit into that.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.580]   You're people in the Republican party
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.320]   who don't fit in it anymore.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.680]   - I mean, I wouldn't even necessarily mind that dynamic
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   you described so much if they weren't breaking everything.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.380]   And if they weren't not allowing conversations
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.320]   about how broken things are and the better ideas, right?
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.000]   It's just a very strange, illiberal nature to this.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.640]   - Right, well, so I think, and I just connected
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.300]   with what we were talking about with Glenn,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.700]   you know, Greenwald and Taibbi, is that,
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.420]   look, if you're part of the elite
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.440]   and you control all of these institutions,
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.120]   all of this cultural high ground,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.040]   but the country is not with you,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.920]   and just in terms of the sheer numbers,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.380]   you are gonna use the tactics that people in power
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.260]   always use to suppress the greater numbers.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.660]   That's where censorship comes from.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.660]   The people who are running these institutions don't,
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.960]   they want the debate to be over.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   They want the power to end the debate
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.560]   because they're not otherwise gonna win that debate.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.980]   - Well, we're very interested in seeing where you take it,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.800]   and we appreciate you taking the time to share your views.
