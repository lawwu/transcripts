[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   Our greatest problems in life are not ignorance problems, they are preference problems.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.380]   And that means our greatest need is not merely new information, our greatest need is being
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.380]   given new preferences, new desires, new loves.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.760]   As John Pepper explained from Romans chapter 1 in a 2015 sermon, here's how he explained
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   it.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:34.880]   "Having set up why we are existing, namely we exist to know and experience and enjoy
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.040]   and reflect the value, the glory, the beauty of God back to Him, He now makes the connection
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   with sex."
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.300]   Isn't that remarkable?
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:59.660]   Four times, this is unmistakable and amazing, four times he makes the connection between
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.840]   the distortion of the relationship vertically and the darkness there with the distortion
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.540]   of the sexual relationship horizontally and the darkness there.
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.780]   So let's see these four times where Paul does this.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.340]   Number one, the connection between verse 23 and 24.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.260]   "They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images," verse 24, "therefore,"
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.420]   that's a very important word, "therefore God gave them up to the lusts of their hearts,
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.260]   to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves."
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.860]   So the exchange vertically, verse 23, "They exchanged the glory of God, results in God
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.100]   handing them over to horizontal dishonorable passions of the body in lust."
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.980]   So where does lust come from?
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:12.180]   Where does the brokenness of our God-given, beautiful, sexual reality come from?
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.820]   Where does that brokenness come from?
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.860]   It comes from the brokenness of exchange.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.300]   Here it is again, the connection between verse 24 and 25.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.780]   "God gave them up to the lusts of their hearts, to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.100]   among themselves," and here comes the other important word besides "therefore," "because."
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.140]   Why did he do that?
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.740]   Why did God hand us over to this mess, this brokenness?
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.260]   "Because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie."
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.980]   Another exchange, same exchange.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.060]   "The truth about God, the glory about God, for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature,"
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.420]   that's us, "rather than the creator who is blessed forever, amen."
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.060]   So he says the cause, don't miss the word "because" there, the cause of lust and impurity
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.860]   and the dishonoring of the body is the embrace of a lie about God.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.980]   Darkness of creation is owing to the darkness as we look at the creator.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.500]   We believe we are more valuable than God.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.620]   Our friends are more valuable to us than God is to us, and sexual pleasure is more valuable
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.420]   to God than God to us.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.980]   We have exchanged him for a lie, and God hands us over.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.020]   Number three, the connection between verses 25 and 26.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:58.420]   They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, verse 26, "for this reason," you see it?
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.740]   They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, "for this reason God gave them up to dishonorable
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.740]   passion."
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.960]   So three times so far he has said that the cause, the reason for God handing us over
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:23.560]   to the dishonoring of our own good God-given passions is because we traded God, and we
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.900]   traded his truth, and we traded his glory for other things, which they are not.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.940]   They are not more preferable.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.220]   Here's the fourth one.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.940]   The relationship between the two halves of verse 28.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:50.140]   "Since," very important word, "and since they did not," now the ESV says here, "see fit
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.140]   to acknowledge."
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.420]   I don't know what your version says.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.420]   Here's my literal translation of documadso.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.540]   Here's the way I would translate it.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.100]   Since they did not approve, that's the usual translation of documadso, they did not approve
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.620]   of having God in their knowledge.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.540]   That's a literal translation.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.020]   See fit to acknowledge God, that's okay, but I think you feel the horror of it if you say
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.860]   they did not approve of having God in their knowledge.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.700]   So the picture is, back in verse 18, they know God and they suppress truth.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:41.700]   So God is approaching them in manifold ways, and we consider that enough to be accountable.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.780]   We know, and we disapprove.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.780]   I don't want you in here.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.220]   I don't want you in my head.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.260]   I don't want you in my heart.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.820]   I disapprove of having you in my knowledge.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.220]   This is where atheism comes from.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.580]   This is where skepticism comes from.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.740]   It's not at first an ignorance problem.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.180]   Nobody's main problem is an ignorance problem.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.980]   Everybody's main problem is a preference problem.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.260]   I don't want you in my head.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.620]   I don't want you in my heart.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.380]   I don't want you to be supremely valuable.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.540]   I will not have a God in my life who is supremely valuable.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.180]   I just won't.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.500]   That's the meaning of the first half of verse 28.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.540]   Since they did not see fit to acknowledge or did not approve, I don't want it, I don't
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:39.660]   approve of having God in my knowledge, therefore God gave them up to a debased mind to do what
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.980]   ought not to be done.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:50.220]   So four times it just could not be clearer, repetitively clearer, that the root issue
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:57.380]   of our horizontal distortions, homosexual and heterosexual, are rooted in, the root
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.300]   of it is, this exchange.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.100]   I don't want you in here.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.700]   And if he's not in here, everything is going wrong in the world.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.700]   That is so good.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.780]   And then of course, explained Piper, there's a positive side here too in covenant marriage.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.820]   You can hear the whole message in a series titled, "Living in the Light with Money, Sex,
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.260]   and Power," a four-part series, three messages and one Q&A.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.500]   And this clip was taken from the second message and they're all on the site, DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.740]   Those messages became the new book, "Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power," a nice
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:39.380]   little hardcover available now on Amazon and downloadable free of charge at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.580]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.820]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with author and longtime pastor, John
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.820]   Piper.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.500]   We'll see you tomorrow.
