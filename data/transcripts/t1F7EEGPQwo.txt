[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.380]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.940]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.780]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.860]   Today, we're talking all about goals
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.820]   and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.300]   There's a tremendous amount of information on the internet
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.120]   and in books and so forth about how to set goals
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.380]   and assess your progress towards goals
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.220]   and update your goals and so forth.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.740]   In fact, there are so many programs out there
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.720]   that include so many different acronyms
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.660]   that it can be a little bit overwhelming.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.580]   Today's conversation about goals
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.260]   is going to be quite a bit different.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.700]   Indeed, we are going to talk about setting goals.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.320]   We are also going to talk about
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.660]   how to assess progress towards goals,
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.060]   and we are going to talk about goal execution.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.380]   However, we're going to do all of this
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.800]   in the context of neuroscience,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.800]   because it turns out that there are not hundreds or dozens
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.380]   or even several neural circuits in your brain
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.920]   that control goal setting and movement toward your goals.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   There is one.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.620]   And while it includes many different brain areas,
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.080]   that one circuit is the same circuit
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.440]   that's responsible for pursuing all goals.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.140]   And it relates to some very basic neurochemical mechanisms
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.400]   that are understood.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280]   So while there's a wealth of information out there
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.860]   about goals and goal setting and goal achievement
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.840]   and so forth, there's comparatively little information
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.500]   that's been available to the public
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.940]   about the neuroscience of goal setting and goal achievement.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.060]   So that's what we're going to focus on today.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.940]   I promise that we're going to get into the neuroscience.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.020]   We're going to touch on a little bit of the psychology
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.100]   and how the neuroscience relates to what's known
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.840]   in the psychology literature.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.940]   And we are going to establish several,
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.060]   in fact, four specific protocols
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.020]   that you can use for goal setting, goal assessment,
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.680]   and goal execution in an ongoing basis,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.600]   regardless of what your personal goals happen to be.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.660]   Before we dive into our conversation about goals
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.580]   and goal setting and goal achievement,
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.780]   I'd like to highlight some recent scientific findings
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.100]   that I think are going to be interesting and actionable
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.220]   for many of you out there.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.980]   In earlier podcasts, we talked about neuroplasticity,
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.700]   which is the brain's ability to change
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.820]   in response to experience.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.540]   In fact, neuroplasticity underlies all forms of learning,
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.140]   whether or not it's language learning or learning music
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.880]   or math or a physical skill.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   All forms of learning involve the reorganization
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.940]   of connections in the nervous system,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.700]   the brain and spinal cord and body.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.340]   One of the key principles of neuroplasticity
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.980]   is this notion of making errors as a good thing
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.380]   toward neuroplasticity.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.020]   This is a little bit counterintuitive,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.340]   but what the scientific literature tells us
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.420]   is that whenever we're trying to learn something new,
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.380]   if we make an error, we know it feels frustrating,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.760]   but that state of frustration actually cues up
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.300]   particular brain areas to be more alert
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.960]   so that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   we have a heightened level of focus
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.980]   and a higher probability of learning the new skill,
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.980]   regardless of what that skill is.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.340]   And I've talked about this before in various episodes
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.000]   as encouraging people to embrace errors or pursue errors,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.220]   not as their own end goal, but errors as an entry point
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.020]   for making the brain more plastic.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.640]   And if you think about it, it really makes sense.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.780]   Why would the brain change at all
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.060]   if it's performing everything perfectly?
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.100]   When you make errors, well, in the immediate seconds
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.820]   and minutes after those errors,
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.440]   you are in a better position to learn.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.200]   A common question I get, however,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.760]   is what should be the rate of errors,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.100]   which is really just a way of saying
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.760]   how hard should the given task be
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.140]   that you're trying to learn or perform?
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.540]   And it turns out there's an answer.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.300]   There's a recent paper that was published
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.680]   in a great journal, Nature Communications.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.720]   This is a paper, a last author, Jonathan Cohen,
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   and the paper is entitled the 85% Rule for Optimal Learning.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.520]   This paper we will make available
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.980]   by a link in the show note captions.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.980]   But basically what this paper shows
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.720]   is that when trying to learn something new,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.020]   you want to make the difficulty
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.940]   of what you're trying to learn
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.980]   such that you're getting things right about 85% of the time,
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.920]   that you're making errors about 15% of the time.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   And the reason I like this paper
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.860]   is it really points specifically
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.740]   to some protocols that we can implement
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.700]   because people always say, okay, you want to set a high goal.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.920]   You want to try and achieve something that's really lofty,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.640]   but you don't want to make the goal so lofty
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   that you don't make any progress at all.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.980]   Other people say you really want to start
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.400]   with really small goals
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.060]   and make things very, very incremental,
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.940]   only set out to do things that you know you can accomplish
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.120]   and that will feed back on your self-esteem
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.680]   and all these positive feedback loops.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.240]   And then, you know, layer by layer, layer by layer,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.900]   you'll eventually get where you want to go.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.400]   Well, it turns out that neither is true.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.220]   You need to set the level of difficulty
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.180]   such that you're making errors about 15% of the time.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.080]   And I want to emphasize about 15% of the time
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.660]   because there's no way to configure protocols
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.880]   for sport or language or math or anything else
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.980]   where you're going to have exactly 15% of errors.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.420]   So anyway, this paper, the 85% rule for optimal learning,
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.820]   again, we will supply the link,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.820]   but it really points to the idea
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.380]   of making things pretty hard,
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.600]   but not so hard that you're failing every attempt
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.100]   or even half of the attempts.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.420]   Failing about 15% of the time seems optimal for learning.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.840]   Hopefully that information will be useful
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.180]   to any of you that are trying to learn something.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.140]   Hopefully it will also be useful to those of you
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.980]   that are teaching kids or other adults.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.820]   If you're teaching,
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.060]   keep in mind that you want to keep the students reaching
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.020]   for higher and higher levels of proficiency
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.820]   in whatever that is that you're teaching,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.820]   and that 15% of the time they should be failing.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.860]   If it gets to 20%, that's probably okay.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.780]   If they start failing about half the time,
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.940]   then probably what they're trying to learn
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.260]   is too difficult for them at that point.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.740]   Now, of course, this is going to be controlled
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.300]   by all sorts of external factors,
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.300]   like whether or not they slept well the night before,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.860]   whether or not you slept well the night before
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.060]   and you're being clear in your instructions
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.340]   to them, et cetera.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.020]   But I think the 15% rule, as we may call it,
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.820]   is a good metric to aim for,
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.100]   and it can serve both students and teachers.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.140]   In other words, it can serve both those teaching
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.100]   and those that are learning.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.500]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.260]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.140]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.560]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.180]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.180]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.900]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.940]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.580]   Element is an electrolyte drink mixed
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.780]   with everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.140]   That means lots of salt,
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.700]   some other electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.420]   As I've mentioned before on this podcast
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.460]   and in various interviews, I'm a big fan of salt.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.400]   I sort of discovered this a few years ago
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.560]   when Science Magazine,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.900]   one of the preeminent magazines out there
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.760]   that publishes research on science,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.460]   but also news articles about science,
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.900]   talked about the myth of salt research.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.060]   It turns out that, contrary to what I had believed,
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.720]   which was that salt is going to cause hypertension
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.320]   or that salt is really bad for us,
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.700]   there's an innate need for salt in our system.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.380]   And indeed, if you dive into the textbooks on salt balance,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.020]   we have entire biological systems or kidneys
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.140]   and fluid management, et cetera,
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.380]   that are involved in making sure that we get enough salt.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.200]   In fact, neurons, nerve cells, function
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.940]   because salt, sodium, actually enters those cells quickly,
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.880]   and that's what causes them to fire action potentials,
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.780]   the common syllable or language of neurons, if you will.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.060]   When we are low in sodium, our neurons don't work as well.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.100]   And a few years later,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.580]   I had the experience of feeling kind of shaky,
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.980]   and I thought I had blood sugar issues.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.100]   I went and got my blood sugar checked and it was fine.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.680]   And a physician made the recommendation
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.700]   that I actually upped my salt intake.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.420]   My intake wasn't particularly low, I didn't think,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.260]   but I quickly found was that if I consumed enough salt,
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.340]   usually I would do this in the form
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.780]   of putting a little pinch of salt into some water,
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.340]   adding a little lemon juice or something like that,
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.380]   or salting my food a little bit more,
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.040]   that I lost any kind of shakiness in my hands,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.900]   that my mental functioning was better,
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.140]   my sports performance was better, et cetera.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.860]   So it was really interesting to see that shift
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.020]   simply by increasing my salt intake,
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.380]   something that's really counterintuitive
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.860]   to a lot of what's out there.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.500]   Salt isn't just important for the function of neurons,
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.300]   it's important for blood volume,
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.680]   and working alongside the other electrolytes,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.240]   magnesium and potassium,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.040]   it ensures that cells in our body function properly.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.280]   And I think we're starting to see a shift out there now
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.900]   in the perception of what salt
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.740]   and the other electrolytes do.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.620]   Really seeing magnesium,
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.540]   which is one of the electrolytes, potassium,
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.760]   and especially salt as not necessarily something to avoid,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.400]   but in fact, something to embrace
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   provided that they're used properly.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.780]   Element is formulated to help anyone
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.520]   reach their electrolyte needs,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.080]   and is particularly well-suited to people
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.740]   following a keto, low-carb, or paleo diet.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.260]   For people following a low-carb diet
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.840]   or doing intermittent fasting,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.180]   what many people don't know is that carbohydrate
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.180]   holds water, it actually brings water into the system,
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.380]   and you don't want your system to be low on water,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.580]   that's one form of dehydration.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.420]   Salt holds water as well,
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.260]   meaning it keeps the water in your system,
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.580]   which is beneficial for brain and body function.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.020]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.440]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.100]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium,
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.360]   and they use the very best forms of salt, potassium,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.520]   and magnesium that are out there.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.860]   So the way I use Element is I usually will mix up one packet
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.660]   into about 16 to 30 ounces of water in the morning
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.400]   and drink that first thing in the morning when I wake up,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.300]   or around breakfast time, doesn't really matter,
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.620]   I kind of sip on it through the morning,
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.420]   or if I'm real thirsty, I'll drink it all at once.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.860]   And then I always make sure to drink a volume of water
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.340]   with an Element packet in it somewhere around my exercise,
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.180]   sometimes it's during the exercise,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.240]   if I'm running, I'll wait until afterwards,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.020]   I'll hydrate with it before and after
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.220]   if it's a really hot day.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.100]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.820]   that's lmnt.com/huberman, to claim a free Element sample pack

[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.220]   otherwise it's completely free.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.420]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman

[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.580]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.940]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.420]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.860]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.540]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.580]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.340]   is that it covers all of my foundational
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.780]   vitamin mineral probiotic needs.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.500]   We of course need vitamins, we of course need minerals,
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.420]   and we do need a healthy gut microbiome,
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.700]   and probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.960]   There's now a wealth of quality scientific published data
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.800]   showing that the microbiota, meaning the little microbes
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.420]   that live in our gut are good for us,
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.700]   and our gut, when it functions properly,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.820]   communicates with our brain,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.380]   and our brain communicates with our gut
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.580]   through the so-called gut brain axis,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.860]   and that gut brain axis is vital for things
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.460]   like immune system, endocrine system, meaning hormones,
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.820]   and for mood and overall brain function.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.060]   With Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.340]   and the probiotics I need to support
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.160]   a healthy gut microbiome and gut brain axis
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.740]   without having to worry about taking
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.100]   a bunch of other things.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.180]   In fact, when people ask me
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.940]   what's the one supplement I should take
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.440]   that's going to make me feel better,
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.840]   I always say Athletic Greens,
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.700]   because indeed it makes me feel better,
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.300]   and it happens to taste terrific.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.360]   I drink it twice a day typically.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.340]   I'll have one in the morning, I mix it with water
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.520]   and a little bit of lemon or lime juice,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.680]   and I'll typically have it again in the afternoon
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.160]   or late afternoon, again mixed with water,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.500]   some lemon or lime juice.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.120]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.940]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.320]   to claim a special offer.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.800]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.780]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.820]   while you're in the car or traveling by plane, et cetera.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.580]   Plus they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.860]   Many of us are deficient in vitamin D3,
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.060]   and even for those of us
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.600]   that are getting sufficient sunshine,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.300]   many of us still need to supplement with vitamin D3.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.100]   Vitamin D3 is involved in metabolism,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.020]   immune system, brain function, hormones, et cetera.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.380]   It has so many important functions,
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.180]   and K2 has been shown to be important
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.380]   for a variety of things,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.560]   not the least of which is cardiovascular health.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.240]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.460]   you can claim a special offer.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.860]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.460]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.400]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.980]   to claim the special offer.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.500]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.560]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.700]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.420]   I spent a lifetime working on the science
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.380]   of the visual system,
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.220]   and I can tell you that your visual system,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.900]   everywhere from your eyes to your brain,
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.100]   includes a ton of different mechanisms
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.040]   so that as you move through different environments,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.620]   you can see things clearly,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.900]   and even if it's bright out or there's shadows
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.500]   or it's really dim outside or it's getting dark,
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.700]   that your visual system can try and manage to resolve
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.000]   what's out there in the world so you can see things clearly.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.860]   Many people need corrective lenses, they need eyeglasses.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.740]   Other people, they need sunglasses as well,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.460]   or just simply need sunglasses,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.880]   because if it's too bright, it's very hard to see things.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.620]   One problem with a lot of eyeglasses
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.300]   and sunglasses out there, however,
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.140]   is they don't take into account
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.580]   the nuanced biology of the visual system.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.780]   You may have experienced this.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.340]   If you ever put on a pair of sunglasses
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.300]   that aren't so great,
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.540]   you move from a really bright area into a dimly lit area,
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.380]   and you have to take the eyeglasses off.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.140]   Your eyes just don't seem to adjust.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.940]   With Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.860]   everything they've done to design those glasses and lenses
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.740]   is with the science of the visual system in mind,
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.060]   so you can move seamlessly from one environment to the next,
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.940]   and you always see things with crystal clarity.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.080]   Their sunglasses and eyeglasses are really terrific
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.860]   because they can be used for anything.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.920]   They have a terrific aesthetic,
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.740]   so you can wear them to work, to dinner, et cetera.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.620]   They look great,
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.220]   and they're also designed for athletic performance.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.760]   You can use them while running or while cycling.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.580]   If you get sweaty, they won't slip off your face.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.940]   They're extremely lightweight.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.180]   In fact, I often forget that they're even on my face.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.700]   I wear readers at night, and sometimes when I drive,
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.140]   and I wear sunglasses when it's really bright outside
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.680]   and I need sunglasses.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.940]   If you want to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.300]   you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.940]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.880]   your first order.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.660]   Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.940]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.720]   Let's talk about the science, and in particular,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.100]   the biology and neuroscience of setting and achieving goals.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.340]   Setting and achieving goals
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.440]   is not a uniquely human endeavor.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.600]   Other animals set and attempt to achieve goals.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.100]   A honeybee attempts to collect honey
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.820]   and bring it back to the hive.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.900]   A herbivore will go out and forage for plants,
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.540]   and will also have a need to reproduce
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.620]   at some point in its life.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.800]   So it will need to find a mate and maybe even raise the young
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.460]   depending on what species that is.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.320]   Predators will have to hunt and kill and eat their food,
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.800]   and they have to avoid getting injured in that process.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.860]   They also have to raise young, et cetera.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.500]   So humans are among the other animals,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.020]   or we could say the animals are among us
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.980]   in the need to set goals and to make efforts to achieve
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.220]   those goals.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.260]   Now, why do I emphasize this commonality of process?
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.800]   The reason I emphasize this commonality of process
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.360]   is that it turns out that there is one basic system
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.860]   by which all animals, including humans,
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.380]   set and attempt to achieve goals.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.900]   Now, humans are unique in our ability
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.540]   to orient our mind toward immediate goals,
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.180]   moderately termed goals, meaning things that might exist
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.700]   on the scale of a week or a month or even a year,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.100]   and very long-term goals, like a lifetime goal
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.740]   or a goal that lasts a decade
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.780]   or it takes a decade to achieve.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.340]   That's what makes us unique.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.440]   And of course, we don't have access to the mindset
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.020]   or the thinking or the emotions of other animals,
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.220]   but what we do know is that common neural circuits,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.420]   meaning brain areas that are present in animal species
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.120]   and in humans, are responsible for orienting our thinking
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.800]   and our action toward particular goals.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   Another thing that's really unique about the human brain
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.200]   is that we are able to have multiple goals
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.700]   interacting at once.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.400]   So for instance, we probably all have fitness goals,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.260]   goals in relationships of different kinds,
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.140]   friendships and romantic partnerships,
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.300]   as well as maybe scholastic goals.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.820]   Maybe you're in school, you're pursuing some kind of learning
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.460]   outside of the school environment
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.100]   and/or you have business goals or financial goals.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.260]   We are able to have multiple goals at once.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.340]   And other animals do this, but humans are unique
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.700]   in the ability to juggle a lot of goals.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.220]   And actually one of the major challenges in pursuing goals
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.840]   is that goal pursuit often interacts.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.560]   Meaning if you can spend 100% of your time
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.280]   chasing one particular goal,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.840]   that might be very effective for that goal,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.780]   but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.160]   You can imagine how this plays out.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.660]   If you're working very, very hard,
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.520]   you're solely focused on business,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.020]   often your health will suffer.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.460]   If you're solely focused on your health,
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.720]   often other things will suffer.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.680]   And so we have to juggle both our goal setting
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.520]   and our goal pursuits.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.820]   And today we're going to talk about
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.880]   a number of different ways to work with
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.420]   what could very well be called these interleaving goals
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.540]   by focusing on a common practice
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.620]   or common set of mechanisms
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.980]   that are present in all aspects of goal seeking.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.440]   What is that process?
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.140]   Well, it turns out it's a neural circuit.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.580]   A neural circuit is simply a collection of brain areas
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.240]   that when active in a particular sequence,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.920]   give rise to a particular behavior or perception.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.380]   So for instance, when you feel happy,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.060]   it's not because you have a brain area
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.960]   that's the happy brain area that is electrically active,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.200]   rather it's going to involve numerous brain areas
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.700]   being active in concert and to different degrees,
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.240]   in the same way that the keys on a piano together
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.720]   played in the appropriate sequence
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.500]   represent a particular song.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.480]   You would never say that one key on the piano
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.220]   represents that song, but that key is necessary.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.660]   Similarly in the brain,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.820]   we can say that a brain area might be necessary,
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.220]   but not sufficient to give us a particular experience
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.900]   or generate a particular behavior.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.240]   So when we think about goal seeking
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.740]   and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain,
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.920]   it doesn't matter what the goal is.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.260]   It involves a common set of neural circuits.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.780]   And the neural circuit that I'd like to orient us toward
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.840]   today, and we will return to it a few times,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.460]   involves learning a couple of names,
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.700]   but you don't have to worry so much about memorizing these,
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.460]   just more important is to understand the logic
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.340]   of how it's put together.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.100]   And I will explain that and make it very clear.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.120]   If you want to learn the names, that's great.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.240]   One of the brain areas is the so-called amygdala.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.620]   The amygdala is most often associated with fear.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.460]   So you might say, wow,
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.220]   how is that involved in goal-directed behavior?
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.220]   Well, a lot of our goal-directed behavior
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.280]   is to avoid punishments,
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.320]   including things like embarrassment or financial ruin
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.740]   or things of that sort.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.940]   And so the amygdala and some sense of anxiety or fear
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.860]   is actually built in to the circuits
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.940]   that generate goal seeking
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.140]   and our motivation to pursue goals.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.140]   The other areas are the so-called ventral striatum.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.980]   The striatum is part of what's called the basal ganglia.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.100]   The basal ganglia is a neural circuit
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.020]   that can very simply be described as a neural circuit
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.700]   that helps us generate go,
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.980]   meaning the initiation of action and no go,
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.460]   the prevention of action type scenarios.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.900]   Let me make that even simpler.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.540]   The ventral striatum is part of this thing
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.580]   called the basal ganglia.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.640]   The basal ganglia has sort of two circuits within it.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.740]   One circuit is involved in getting us to do things
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.200]   like I'm going to get up tomorrow
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.780]   and I'm going to run five miles first thing in the morning.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.900]   I don't know if I'm actually going to do that,
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.060]   but I'm just using that as an example.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   Another circuit within the basal ganglia
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.140]   is a no-go circuit.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.960]   It's the one that says,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.900]   no, I'm not going to go for the second cookie
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.100]   or the third cookie.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.980]   I'm not going to eat that.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.340]   And then the go circuit would be the one that's responsible
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.880]   for instead eating something else, okay?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.140]   So we have go and no-go circuits within the basal ganglia.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.440]   So we've got amygdala.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   So think of as kind of fear and anxiety and avoidance.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.000]   We've got the basal ganglia,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   which are for initiating action and preventing action.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.680]   And then there is the so-called cortex.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440]   The cortex is the outer shell of the brain
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.980]   and there are two sub regions of the cortex
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.360]   that are involved in goal-directed behavior.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   One is the lateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.740]   Prefrontal cortex is involved
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.660]   in so-called executive function, things like planning,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.980]   thinking about things under different timescales.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.020]   So not just what we want in the immediate term,
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.860]   but what we might want tomorrow or the next day
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.140]   and how our actions currently
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.860]   are going to relate to the future.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.800]   And the so-called orbitofrontal cortex.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.480]   Orbitofrontal cortex has a large number of functions,
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.060]   but one of the key functions of the orbitofrontal cortex,
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.740]   it's involved in meshing some emotionality
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.600]   with our current state of progress
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.580]   and comparing that emotionality
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.400]   to where it might be when we are closer to a goal, okay?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.940]   So there are basically four areas,
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.940]   one involved in anxiety, one involved in emotion,
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.380]   one involved in planning,
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.380]   and another involved in this go/no-go action.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.500]   So that's a bunch of detail,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.140]   but if I wanted to make it really simple for everyone,
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.980]   I would say there are four areas.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.220]   One is an area associated with anxiety and fear,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.100]   it's the amygdala.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.700]   The second is involved in action and inaction.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.300]   Remember, go and no-go.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.980]   So that's the basal ganglia.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.940]   The other one is involved in planning and thinking
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.120]   across different timescales.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.940]   So that's lateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.940]   And then the fourth one is involved in emotionality,
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.540]   where we sit emotionally at present
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.040]   compared to where we think we will be emotionally
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.300]   when we reach some particular goal,
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.660]   and that's the orbitofrontal cortex, okay?
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.740]   Again, you don't need to know all those names.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.680]   You don't need to know all the details.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.980]   Just understand that those different elements are involved
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.880]   in the decision-making processes
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.860]   that lead us toward particular goals
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.060]   and have us update our goal-seeking, et cetera.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.360]   One key thing is it doesn't matter what the goal is.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.340]   The same circuits are involved.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.860]   So whether or not you're trying to build a company
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.140]   that's a billion-dollar company that's going to go public,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.820]   or you're thinking about planning a craft's day at home
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.460]   with the kids or for yourself,
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.300]   or you're thinking about what movie to go see,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.340]   goals, goal-seeking, and assessing progress towards goals
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.340]   all involve the exact same neural circuits.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.420]   It's really remarkable.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.780]   It's also very convenient for our discussion today.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.000]   What's going on in these circuits can basically be boiled
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.360]   down to two particular things.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.920]   The first is value information,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.900]   trying to understand whether or not something
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.620]   is really worth pursuing or not, okay?
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   So placing a value on a particular goal.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.100]   The other component of this neural circuit
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.380]   is associated with action, which actions to take
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.220]   and which actions not to take,
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.420]   given the value of a particular goal
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.500]   in a given moment's time.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.540]   I want to say that again.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.580]   The other component of the circuit is involved in action,
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.420]   whether or not you should act or should not act
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.940]   based on your assessment of the value of a goal
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.340]   at a particular moment in time.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.740]   And you're going to hear me say over and over again
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.980]   in this episode, the value information
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.660]   about a goal is so key.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.420]   Here's why.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.700]   There is basically one neurotransmitter
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.660]   or rather neuromodulator system
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.220]   that governs our goal-setting, goal assessment,
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.100]   and goal pursuit.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.340]   And that is the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.340]   Dopamine is the common currency by which we assess
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.220]   our progress toward particular things of particular value.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.820]   In fact, dopamine is the way that we assess value
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.020]   of our pursuits.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.120]   And so as we take a moment and we shift our attention
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.220]   to the psychology of goal-setting,
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.380]   the things that you've probably heard a bit more about,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.140]   about what sorts of goals are good and how to set goals
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.900]   and how to categorize goals,
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.340]   I want you to think about how dopamine could possibly
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.780]   be involved in these different processes.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.120]   And the reason I want you to do this is that
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.120]   all of the psychology of goal-setting and goal pursuit
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.860]   is wonderful because it places things
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.380]   into different categories.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.140]   It allows us to parse our thinking
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.380]   and organize our thinking, but what's not often seen,
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.580]   in fact, I'm not aware of any literature out there,
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.220]   scientific or literature in the popular press
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.300]   or in popular books, is an understanding
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.420]   of how the underlying neurobiology can be layered
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.540]   on top of the psychology of goal-setting
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.780]   to allow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.940]   And that's what we're going to do today.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.520]   We are eventually going to arrive at a set of four practices
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.380]   that when performed on a regular basis
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.820]   will allow you to assess what is the value
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.820]   of this next particular action step?
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.460]   How worthwhile is it to do behavior A versus behavior B
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.620]   in order to achieve a particular goal?
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.180]   If any of this is vague now,
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.900]   I'm going to make it all very clear for you.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.740]   You're going to come away
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.860]   with some very specific lists of takeaways
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.540]   that you can put down on paper if you like,
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.580]   and that you can use to set goals, assess goals,
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.580]   and execute goals more effectively
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.660]   using the neuroscience of the circuits I just described
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.660]   and an understanding of the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.400]   Let's take a look at the psychology
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.380]   of goal-setting and goal pursuit.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.160]   This is an enormous literature,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.700]   meaning there are tens of thousands,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.700]   if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.180]   about the topic of goal-setting and goal pursuit.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.120]   There's also a lot of information on the internet
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.500]   about goal pursuit.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.160]   And in looking over this information,
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.500]   one comes to appreciate pretty quickly
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   that acronyms are a big thing.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.220]   Acronyms seem to dominate the area of goal-setting,
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.780]   especially as it relates to things in the business sector,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.380]   but also in the relationship sector.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.940]   Now, acronyms are wonderful.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.820]   They allow us to organize our thinking into lists
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.360]   and conceptually, they can be very useful.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.940]   But as I moved through this literature,
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.980]   I started to see some redundant themes.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.360]   And so what I've attempted to do
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   is distill out the redundant themes
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.520]   that regardless of the person teaching
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.740]   or the scientific laboratory
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.900]   that happened to come up with these acronyms,
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.020]   that they boil down to some common features.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.220]   So let's talk about that literature.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.940]   And I think we'll come away with an understanding
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.320]   of some basic elements that are common to all goals.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.280]   Now, the modern science or the modern psychological science
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.180]   of trying to understand goal-setting and pursuit
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.200]   actually dates back to the 1930s.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.700]   And we have to be sure that members of our species
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.620]   were focused on goal-setting and goal pursuit
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.220]   long before the scientific literature emerged.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.680]   It just stands to reason that since the human brain
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.980]   hasn't evolved that much,
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.740]   we don't think in the last 10,000 years
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.120]   that people would be thinking about these things.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.800]   They just didn't get them down into papers
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.740]   that we could evaluate on PubMed and so forth.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.900]   But now we can, so we can look at those papers.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.480]   And what you find is that acronyms abound
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.000]   in the psychology literature
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.960]   about goal-setting and goal pursuit.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.900]   So for instance, you'll hear about
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.820]   the work of Locke and Small, for instance,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.640]   these are the last names of various researchers,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.220]   the so-called ABC method,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.900]   that a goal should be achievable, it should be believable,
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.220]   and that the person be committed.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.540]   It's sort of obvious once you hear it, but the ABC method.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.940]   Then people came along and expanded on that.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.880]   They talk about the so-called SMART method,
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.660]   SMART being another acronym, that it be specific,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.220]   that the goal be measurable, that the goal be attainable,
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.720]   that the goal be realistic, and that it be time-bound,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.740]   meaning that you set a certain period of time
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.300]   in which a given goal should be performed.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.120]   And then people come along and modify these.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.900]   This is the way that psychology research is done.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.100]   I'm not laughing at it.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.540]   I'm just chuckling because it seems like the acronyms
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.420]   get longer and longer and longer.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.840]   They developed the SMART-er approach,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.560]   adding an ER to the acronym SMART, S-M-A-R-T-E-R.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.520]   They added ethical and rewarding,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.080]   which fortunately are good things, I believe,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.160]   ethical and rewarding.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.800]   What does all this mean?
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.460]   Well, what it means is that any kind of goal pursuit,
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.420]   any kind of goal setting really has to involve
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.720]   a number of different states and neural circuits
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.800]   in the brain and body.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.880]   At least that's how I view this literature.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.720]   Why would I do that?
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.760]   Well, let's think about the very modern version
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.100]   of the kind of acronyms that I talked about a moment ago,
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.900]   dating back to the 1930s and extending into the 1990s.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.940]   You can find beautiful talks online
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.380]   from people who have worked with some of the biggest
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.360]   companies and greatest high performers out there
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.880]   to achieve incredible things.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.120]   And they will talk about generating
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.480]   a sort of objective mindset for goal setting.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.160]   They'll talk about goals needing to be significant.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.340]   That has to be a big goal, that it has to be concrete.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.100]   So you have to be able to describe what the goal is.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.560]   It has to be action oriented.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.200]   It has to be inspirational, has to be time bound.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.520]   You have to have reasonable, realistic, verifiable measures.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.500]   You have to constantly up the ante.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.860]   If it's starting to sound repetitive,
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.480]   it's because it is repetitive.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.500]   There are basically only three or four elements
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.660]   to goal setting and goal pursuit.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.680]   Basically an individual or set of individuals
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.240]   has to identify a specific thing
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   that they're going to attain.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.440]   In some communities, they talk about knowing
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.860]   what right looks like, meaning being able to define
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.960]   a very specific goal.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.380]   You can't just say, "I want to be a champion athlete."
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.040]   You have to say, "What sport?"
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.680]   And you have to understand what the path to that is.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.440]   So any big goal of course is broken up
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.320]   into a series of smaller goals,
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.880]   but the whole thing starts with thinking
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.120]   about the end in mind.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.800]   And in a few minutes, we will talk about
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.900]   whether or not visualization of the end in mind
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.080]   is actually beneficial or detrimental to achieving goals.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.400]   There's actually great neuroscience
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.600]   and psychology data on that now.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.520]   So I mentioned all these acronyms,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.620]   not as an attempt to disparage them.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.620]   I think they're wonderful.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.920]   And I mentioned all that psychology literature,
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.900]   not in an attempt to disparage it,
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.460]   but rather to just say that goal setting is the first step.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.240]   Assessment of whether or not one is making progress
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.700]   towards those goals is a second but necessary step.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.260]   And then there's the business of goal execution.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.540]   And that brings us back to the neural circuit components.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.420]   Remember, this neural circuit involving
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.340]   those four things earlier,
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.920]   the amygdala striatum over frontal cortex
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.340]   and the prefrontal cortex,
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.740]   they work together to divide the whole process,
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.440]   as I mentioned before, into two general categories.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.640]   The first is assessing value,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.860]   knowing whether or not where one is at one given moment
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.600]   relates to some external thing.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Are things going well or are things going poorly?
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.840]   And knowing how to gauge that accurately.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   And then action steps, goes and no goes,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.280]   do more of this, do less of that,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.460]   do this, don't do that, et cetera.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.420]   So now we are going to shift back to the neuroscience
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.400]   and we're going to talk about the practical applications
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.260]   of the information I just described,
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.580]   because I've given you a lot of kind of academic information.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.980]   And as we do this, I'd like you to keep in mind,
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.240]   what are some things that you've either accomplished
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.620]   or that you'd like to accomplish going forward?
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.580]   Because as we do this,
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.900]   we can build toward a set of protocols that at the end,
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.380]   you'll be able to very quickly plug in your particular goals
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.280]   and a route to those particular goals
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.580]   that's grounded in the science
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.460]   and I think are going to be very effective
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.960]   in allowing you to reach those goals more quickly
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.420]   and with indeed less effort.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.960]   In fact, let's start with a tool now,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.140]   because as we move through all this information,
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.580]   I want to make sure that people are coming away
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.800]   with some practical things that they can implement
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.380]   and indeed some things that you can even do
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.040]   during the course of listening to or watching this podcast.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.940]   The first thing to do is to understand the difference
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.880]   between peripersonal space and extra personal space.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.580]   Peripersonal space is all the space literally
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.580]   that's within inside your body, the surface of your skin
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.740]   and in your immediate environment.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.420]   Peripersonal space is a key concept in neuroscience
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.300]   because you have particular neural circuits
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.420]   and particular chemicals that are geared toward
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.340]   what are called consumatory behaviors,
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.860]   meaning using things and consuming things
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.260]   and enjoying things that are in your immediate
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.840]   peripersonal space.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.860]   Let me give you an example of this for myself
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.040]   just to make it concrete.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.940]   You can imagine similar examples for yourself right now.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.420]   Within my current peripersonal space is my interoception,
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.400]   my understanding or perception of my internal body.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.060]   So how quickly I'm breathing, my heart rate,
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.940]   the feelings on the surface of my skin, et cetera.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.380]   But also within the confines of my peripersonal space
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.280]   is this coffee mug that if you're listening to this,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.660]   you can't see this, but I'm lifting up a coffee mug.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.020]   I'm going to take a sip of coffee.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.300]   That's a consumatory behavior.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.260]   I have the coffee.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.020]   I don't have to do much or motivate much to get it.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.220]   I have other things here, pens and computer, et cetera.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.900]   Okay, so things in your peripersonal space
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.980]   and consuming those things is generally governed
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.460]   by a set of neurochemicals that center around
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.220]   the neuromodulator serotonin.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.540]   And there are a few others as well,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.900]   things like oxytocin, but mainly serotonin.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.060]   Contrast that with the so-called extra personal space.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.540]   Extra personal space is everything
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.380]   beyond the confines of my reach.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.100]   It would be something in the next room.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.780]   It would be something down the street.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.140]   It will be something at some other location
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.500]   in space and time.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.680]   And the neuromodulators and neurochemicals
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.340]   that are associated with any kind of thinking about anything
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.540]   in the extra personal space are distinct
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.420]   from the neurochemicals and neuromodulators
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.540]   that are involved in thinking about
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.700]   or making actions towards the peripersonal space.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.740]   And the molecule that's most associated
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.760]   with thinking about or orienting
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.260]   toward the extra personal space,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.260]   again, things beyond the confines of my skin
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.980]   or your skin is dopamine.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.780]   And this is a vitally important concept to understand
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.000]   when you're setting goals and seeking goals.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.780]   If we are to be good at goal-seeking,
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.580]   if we are to be good at setting goals and assessing goals,
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.780]   if we are to achieve our goals,
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.880]   we have to be able to toggle back and forth
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.420]   between a clear understanding of our peripersonal space,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.220]   what we have and how we feel in the immediate present,
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.980]   and our ability to understand what's out there
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.140]   in the extra personal space
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.820]   and our ability to move into that extra personal space.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.740]   And a simple way to conceive of all this
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.740]   is that we evaluate our progress in the peripersonal space.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.920]   We evaluate how we feel about some pursuit,
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.200]   even if we haven't initiated that pursuit yet.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.440]   How we feel about a particular goal
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.140]   is truly a feeling that we experience in the here and now,
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.640]   even though the goal is in the future, okay?
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.260]   If we are going to evaluate
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.420]   whether or not we made progress today or yesterday or not,
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.760]   that's an evaluation of how we feel
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.200]   in the immediate peripersonal space.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.960]   However, moving toward any goal
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.160]   involves orienting our thinking
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.660]   towards the extra personal space.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.700]   And as we go through today's episode,
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.340]   I'm going to teach you a technique
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.640]   or rather a neuroscience-based tool
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.000]   that will allow you to continually transition back and forth
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.560]   between the peripersonal space and the extra personal space
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.220]   in a way that will allow you to update and evaluate
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.480]   and better execute your goal seeking.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.600]   The whole principle behind this
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.400]   is that human beings like other animals
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.360]   have to make evaluations about whether or not
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.500]   they are on the right track.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.460]   However, the important thing to understand
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.440]   is that humans in particular can do this
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.100]   over different timescales.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.120]   We don't just pursue food 'cause we are hungry,
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.200]   we pursue food, excuse me, for a particular meal
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.660]   that we might be having with people tomorrow, right?
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.240]   We can modulate the timescale
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.040]   in a way that other animals don't.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.920]   That's how we adjust our goal seeking
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.400]   to different timescales.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.360]   And in addition to that,
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.160]   humans are exquisitely good at biasing our behavior
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.000]   toward particular goals over very long periods of time.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.780]   But there are a lot of mistakes out there.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.280]   In fact, things that are outright wrong in the literature
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.480]   and in particular in the internet
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.440]   and then the kind of wellness and fitness
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.800]   and cognitive fitness space
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.540]   that send people down the wrong path.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.140]   And those things we will talk about in a few minutes,
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.240]   but things like visualization,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.960]   that visualization and visualization of this big goal
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.240]   is the best way to achieve your goals.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.160]   In fact, that's not the case.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.840]   There's a much better approach to doing all this.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.520]   So now I'd like to shift gears
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.440]   towards talking about a few of the things
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.640]   that most people get badly wrong
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.680]   in setting and assessing and executing goals.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.840]   This is based on peer-reviewed research.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.420]   So I think it's very solid.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.920]   I know it is very solid.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.560]   And it runs counter to what many of us have been taught.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.040]   Let's start with a simple one.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.680]   We've all heard that multitasking is bad, okay?
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.220]   We've heard multitasking is bad.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.340]   It doesn't allow for focus.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.740]   If you want to achieve anything,
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.840]   you want to accomplish anything, you should not multitask.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.020]   Well, it turns out that's wrong.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.320]   It turns out that there is a role for multitasking,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.500]   but the multitasking has to be placed at a particular time
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.520]   within your goal seeking behavior in order to be effective.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   Really nice studies done at Carnegie Mellon University
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.080]   and the Dabish Lab evaluated how long people are able
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.280]   to focus in different environments,
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.860]   how long they were able to stay concentrated on their work.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.120]   And it turns out that number is exceedingly low.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.540]   It turns out that most people,
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.340]   whether or not they're doing computer work
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.160]   or whether or not they're doing writing or accounting work
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.220]   or anything of that sort can hold their attention
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.940]   for about three minutes at a time
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.260]   before they shift their attention off.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.460]   That's ridiculously low when you first hear it,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.860]   but that probably reflects a basic state of brain function
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.780]   that hearkens back to a time when we were hunter-gatherers.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.340]   I doubt that we were maintaining focus solidly
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.520]   for hours and hours and hours
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.480]   unless we were under some particular threat
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.880]   or in some particular crisis.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.180]   Rather, you could imagine that people collected seeds
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.660]   and nuts and berries for about three minutes
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.000]   and then probably stood up, looked around,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.340]   and then kept going, okay?
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.140]   Or that they were hunting animals
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.740]   or in some sort of pursuit, fishing, et cetera,
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.100]   and focused, focused, focused.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.900]   Then every three minutes or so, they might've looked up
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.140]   and taken a look at the sky or looked around
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.220]   to make sure that other people were there
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.500]   or not there, et cetera.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.220]   It all stands to reason that that will be the case.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.660]   Again, the neural circuits haven't evolved much.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.300]   Now, multitasking has been shown
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.380]   to have a very interesting physiological signature.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.620]   When we multitask, when we jump back and forth
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.700]   between things, there is an increase
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.100]   in the level of the neurotransmitter,
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.900]   also sometimes called a neuromodulator,
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.240]   but basically same thing for sake of this discussion.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.580]   There's an increase in the neurotransmitter epinephrine,
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.140]   which is adrenaline.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.220]   And so there are really nice studies now point to the fact
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.420]   that doing a bit of multitasking prior
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.140]   to jumping into some focused goal-directed behavior,
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.060]   whether or not it's mental behavior or physical behavior,
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.540]   can actually be useful because it gets us into action.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.920]   So we've all been told that multitasking is terrible,
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   but if you, for instance, find yourself cleaning up
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.340]   your house and also checking your phone
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.600]   and doing a number of things right at the point
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.080]   where you should be sitting down to write
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.620]   or do some focused work,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.020]   it probably reflects some adaptive mechanism
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.780]   where you use action and somewhat varied multitasking action
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.820]   in order to generate adrenaline in your system
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.460]   because adrenaline just gets you into action.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.460]   Now that's great, but you don't want to multitask
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.980]   throughout any kind of goal seeking or goal pursuit behavior
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.220]   because what's also very clear,
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.900]   and we're going to talk about this in exquisite depth today,
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.580]   is that visual focus and in particular,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.180]   contracting your visual window,
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.540]   bringing the aperture of what you see to a very fine point
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:01.360]   can absolutely increase your clarity of goal seeking
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.620]   and the likelihood that you will pursue your goals.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.680]   I've talked about this a little bit before on the podcast
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.940]   as a way of increasing focus for any kind of pursuit.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.380]   I've talked about a practice whereby you can literally look
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.820]   at a dot or a line placed on a wall
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.420]   or on your computer in front of you for 30 to 60 seconds,
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.820]   and then moving into some dedicated work
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.700]   where you need to focus.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.300]   And indeed just looking at a narrow piece
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.620]   of the visual world, a small piece of the visual world
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.260]   for some period of time and forcing yourself
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.900]   to hold that gaze on that location as best you can,
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.440]   can increase your level of cognitive attention
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.280]   and your ability to focus and stay focused.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.780]   And this is not magic.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.120]   It is the consequence of the fact
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.080]   that most of your cognition follows your visual perception.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.000]   For those of you that are low vision or no vision,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.400]   meaning you're blind or you have trouble seeing,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.320]   my lab does a lot of work with people
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.080]   who are low vision, no vision.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.540]   They tend to use their auditory system, their hearing,
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.300]   as a way to anchor their attention to particular things.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.380]   But most people out there can see and see pretty well,
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.880]   and visual focus is the way to do that.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.820]   Now, earlier we were talking about this notion
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.400]   of peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.180]   And I'm just going to seed a little bit
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.660]   of the later conversation by saying that when we focus
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.860]   on an external point, we are in a process of exteroception,
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.520]   is the focus on the extrapersonal space,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.860]   not the peripersonal space.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.080]   So when we focus on something, say a line on the wall
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.400]   for 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer for 30 to 60 seconds
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.800]   and just look at it and then move into any kind of action,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.340]   whether or not it's work action or physical action,
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.600]   we are at its very core,
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.800]   we are engaging in this pursuit of extrapersonal space.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.360]   We are placing our focus outside our body,
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.240]   and therefore we are placing the brain
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.120]   into goal pursuit mode.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.680]   Work at NYU, in particular in the laboratory
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.000]   of a phenomenal researcher in their psychology department
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.440]   by the name of Emily Balcetis, B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.820]   Emily Balcetis has done really nice work on this.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.440]   They've done is they've had people focus
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.520]   their visual attention on a goal line of some sort,
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.560]   and then to engage in some sort of behavior
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.840]   that requires a lot of effort.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.280]   And they've done a lot of different experiments like this,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.580]   but I'll just explain one.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.240]   They always include a control group
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.420]   where people have to go through the same physical effort
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.360]   or mental effort, but they don't focus their attention
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.840]   just on one location.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.040]   The long and short of these studies
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.000]   is that when people have to focus their attention
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.260]   on one location, like a goal line,
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.040]   they are much more effective in reaching those goals
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:45.080]   and they achieve them with the perception
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.020]   that they expended less effort.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.580]   I'll give you an example of one particularly nice study
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.960]   from the Balcetis lab.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.040]   So this particular study involves physical exercise,
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.020]   although, as I mentioned before,
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.400]   they've done similar studies
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.680]   looking at cognitive type work.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.720]   And what they did is they had a group of people
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.360]   exercise wearing 15 pound ankle weights,
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.580]   and they had to basically move a certain distance
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.280]   or run a certain distance to reach a goal line.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.520]   One group was focused on the goal line,
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.280]   visually focused on the goal line.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.740]   The other group was not told to visually focus
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.720]   on the goal line.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.880]   And what they found was that the group
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.340]   that focused on the goal line
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.980]   was able to achieve reaching that goal
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.900]   with 17% less effort, they measured effort,
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.120]   and it got there 23% quicker.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.060]   That's a remarkable difference, right?
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.820]   So same distance traveled with same workload
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.420]   because everyone's wearing the same
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.100]   15 pound weights on their ankles.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.400]   One group is simply looking at the goal line.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.680]   The other group is not told to look at the goal line.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.620]   Simply by looking at the goal line
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.320]   does something to the psychology
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.620]   and physiology of these people
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.300]   that allows them to move forward
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.360]   with less perceived effort and to do it more quickly.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.280]   That's remarkable, right?
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.120]   And in this case, they're focused on the goal line,
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.800]   but in a few moments, we'll talk about
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.040]   how one can use updating of goal lines,
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.160]   so incremental goal lines,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.840]   starting with an intermediate goal
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.160]   and then extending the goal line further and further.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.400]   But just sit back for a second and think about that.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.860]   Just by changing where a person looks,
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.020]   they change their perceived effort
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.840]   and their ability to do something more effectively,
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.980]   more quickly than a group that is not
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.960]   deliberately focusing their visual attention
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.340]   on one location.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.520]   That's incredible.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.120]   And it's so incredible, in fact, you might say,
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.860]   well, how could that possibly be?
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.140]   Well, it turns out it has a very specific
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.980]   underlying physiological reason,
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.980]   and that has to do with changes
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.040]   in our so-called autonomic nervous system,
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.120]   the aspects of our nervous system
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.780]   that prepare us for readiness and action,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.280]   or that prepare us for resting and relaxing.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.540]   So what is special about focusing one's visual attention
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.280]   at a given location?
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.960]   Well, it turns out that we have two branches
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.880]   of our visual system.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.680]   So visual information all comes in through our eyes,
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.440]   but then it can head down two different pathways.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.080]   One pathway is engaged when our vision
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.300]   is brought to a common point,
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.720]   what we call a vergence eye movement.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.360]   So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.460]   regardless of how far away from us that point is,
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.640]   our visual system engages a certain set of neurons,
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.480]   neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail,
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.560]   and that can evaluate small changes
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.880]   over small periods of time.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.500]   Just think of it as a very detailed camera
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.160]   of the visual world, and it tends to be very restricted.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.260]   The other pathway through the visual system
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.900]   is a so-called magnocellular pathway.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.480]   And this is a pathway that's involved
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.240]   in taking in global information
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.960]   about lots of things that are happening around us,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.200]   movement of things to our right,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.440]   movement of things to our left,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.860]   things that are happening down on the ground
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.700]   and all around us.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.700]   And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will,
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.560]   of the neural circuits that are associated
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.920]   with alertness and attention.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.880]   When you walk down the street
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.840]   and you're not thinking about much,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.440]   provided you're not looking at your phone,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.560]   you're not focusing on one location,
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.620]   you're more or less in a relaxed state
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.760]   compared to when you're looking for a particular sign,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.680]   you're looking for a bus or a train that's coming
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   or a particular person,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.760]   and that should inherently make sense.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.000]   When your level of attention and alertness goes up,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.840]   there's sort of a small but perceptible increase
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.160]   in your level of arousal.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.020]   It's not really stress necessarily,
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.200]   but arousal of alertness.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.660]   And it turns out that the visual system
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.200]   accomplishes this increase in alertness
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.300]   by communicating with your circulatory system
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.140]   and the system that delivers blood and nutrients and oxygen
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.080]   to the rest of the tissues in your body.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.780]   So let's talk for a second about what focusing our vision
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.160]   on a particular location does,
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.100]   because in this study from the Balcetas lab,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.020]   what they found was focusing on a goal line
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.520]   allows people to move more effectively toward that goal.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.860]   This is something you can leverage in all aspects
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.080]   of all goal pursuits.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.660]   What happens when we focus on a particular location?
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:50.720]   Believe it or not,
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.840]   there's an increase in a particular feature
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.640]   of our blood pressure.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.120]   Now, your body has, of course,
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.820]   arteries, veins, and capillaries,
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.660]   and your heart pumps blood first to the arteries
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.480]   and then to the other components of your vascular system.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.960]   And we have so-called blood pressure, right?
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.300]   Blood pressure is just how much the fluid volume
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.400]   is pressing on those arteries, veins, and capillaries, right?
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.260]   So you can imagine a pipe
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.100]   with very little fluid moving through it,
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.000]   that's low pressure.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.340]   You have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it,
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.260]   that's even more pressure.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.480]   You have a pipe with a lot of very viscous,
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.200]   meaning very kind of sticky thick stuff moving forward,
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.560]   that's even more pressure.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.620]   We have blood pressure,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.560]   and you've probably had your blood pressure measured.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.980]   There's always two numbers, right?
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.740]   You have a top number, which is the systolic blood pressure,
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.060]   and then there's the bottom number below the line,
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.200]   which is the diastolic pressure.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.500]   So the important thing to understand
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.320]   is that your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.880]   because there's more fluid moving through those pipes
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.260]   that are your arteries, your veins, and your capillaries.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.940]   And that top number is called the systole
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.740]   or the systolic blood pressure
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.300]   because that's the pressure
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.160]   at the time when your heart contracts, okay?
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.380]   So the top number,
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.660]   which normally if you have a healthy blood pressure
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.980]   is somewhere in the range of 90 to 120 millimeters
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.800]   of mercury.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.660]   Millimeters of mercury is just the way
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.800]   that pressure is measured.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.820]   That top number, your systole,
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.620]   your systolic blood pressure
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.740]   is what's measured when the heart contracts, okay?
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.200]   So that's the amount of pressure when there's a heartbeat
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.980]   and it's moving through your vasculature.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.620]   Now, between beats, right?
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.600]   The heart beats, but then it relaxes.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.980]   Your blood pressure is going to drop to a lower value, right?
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.060]   Because fluid isn't being pumped through the system
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.060]   at those moments.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.340]   And that's the bottom value, the diastolic pressure.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.620]   And typically for healthy people,
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.680]   that's going to be 60 to 80 millimeters of mercury.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.760]   So you might hear about a normal blood pressure
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.780]   being about, again, this is an approximate, 120 over 80.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.080]   What that means is at the point where blood was being pumped
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.580]   through your arteries and veins, boom,
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.840]   that it's 120 millimeters of mercury.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.220]   But then when the heart relaxes for a second
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.340]   before the next beat, then it drops to 80, okay?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.940]   So there's high pressure, low pressure,
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.240]   high pressure, low pressure.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.180]   The fluid is being pumped through the system.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.400]   Now, why am I telling you all this?
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.160]   Well, it turns out that there are neural circuits
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.620]   that link your visual system
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.140]   and focusing on a particular point with that top number,
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.660]   the systolic blood pressure.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.980]   And when you focus your eyes on a particular location,
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.300]   that systolic blood pressure goes up,
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.780]   and there are some other systems that are coordinated
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.300]   with it in your brain and body
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.480]   that start releasing adrenaline,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.660]   low amounts of adrenaline in most cases,
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.040]   and that adrenaline further readies your body for action.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.020]   So bringing our visual focus to a particular location
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.800]   does a number of things to the brain
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.900]   and the whole system of the body to prepare it,
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.520]   to place it into a state of readiness
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.140]   that makes us more likely to lean into our goals,
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.260]   into action.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.580]   And if we step back and think about this,
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.080]   this makes perfect sense.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.600]   The brain and body need to be coordinated.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.260]   We can't just think about a goal.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.620]   In fact, a deer or a lion can't just think about a goal.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.580]   It has to think about a goal
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.400]   and then has to feel some sort of activation energy,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.180]   some willingness or desire to move forward
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.660]   in pursuit of that goal.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.480]   So imagining a goal has to be coupled
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.120]   to the physical pursuit of the goal.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.980]   So our visual system in a beautiful way
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.800]   brings together a focus, literally a visual focus
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.440]   on a particular point outside us.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.040]   Then it recruits an increase in systolic blood pressure,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.760]   which creates a systemic, a body-wide and brain-wide
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.660]   increase in fuel utilization, in oxygen availability,
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.100]   in our willingness to move forward as a body,
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.040]   as a whole coherent system.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.340]   And then there are also neurotransmitter systems
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.840]   like epinephrine, as we will soon see dopamine,
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.240]   that get recruited as well
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.040]   to place us into a continual mode of action.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.960]   This to me is a remarkable feature of our physiology.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.600]   And it gets right to the point
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.640]   of some of the psychological phenomenon
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.920]   that we were talking about earlier.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.320]   Let's just recall what some of those are.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.800]   I won't list them all, but, you know,
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.360]   a goal has to be significant, they say, okay?
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.560]   All the psychologists, all the popular stuff online says
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.420]   it has to be significant, has to be inspirational,
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.980]   and it has to be action-oriented.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.520]   Okay, so let's say you look out into the landscape
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.860]   of what's available to you,
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.240]   whether or not it's just in your mind,
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.760]   or you look at a specific point.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.560]   You say, ah, I want to go to that particular restaurant
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.020]   to eat that particular food,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.160]   and you orient towards it and you move towards it.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.780]   This is the way that your brain and body
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.760]   are coordinating their actions together.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.800]   Conversely, when our visual system
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.760]   is in a mode of looking at everything,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.500]   when the aperture of our visual system is very broad,
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.840]   we know that there's also a reduction
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.240]   in our goal-directed behavior
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.280]   and a reduction in the systolic blood pressure.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.800]   It's as if our peripersonal space is sufficient.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.880]   We don't need to get beyond our current state.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.000]   We're not oriented toward any one thing in particular.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.320]   Okay, so I've now described some of the psychology
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.440]   and some of the underlying physiology.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.140]   Now I'd like to mesh this within the context
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:01.560]   of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit,
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.280]   because what many of you are probably thinking is,
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.380]   okay, well, that's some physiology, there's some psychology,
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.300]   but how do you actually apply this
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.080]   towards setting and achieving goals?
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.600]   Well, you do that by understanding that your mental frame
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.920]   and your attention are always either positioned
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.580]   to your peripersonal space,
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:22.160]   focused on your immediate possessions and state,
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.920]   or towards things outside you,
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.400]   but that you also have the ability to dynamically travel
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.680]   back and forth between those.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.920]   And so next, we're going to talk about
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.120]   what the literature says about things like visualization,
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.360]   immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals,
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.840]   and how to best achieve those.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.300]   And then we're going to move specifically
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.080]   into the protocols that you can use.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.800]   It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you,
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.260]   the listeners, in order to incorporate all the science
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.260]   into a best practice that you can do anytime, any place,
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.740]   to really identify what it is specifically
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.220]   that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.460]   and achieve that goal.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.560]   Focusing our visual attention on one particular point
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.760]   is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.980]   And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.780]   or read a review of the scientific studies
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.880]   that have looked at how narrowing one's visual attention
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.560]   can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals,
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.880]   I'll put a link to this study.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.820]   The title of the study is "Keeping the Goal in Sight,
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.340]   Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.720]   on Physical Activity."
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.940]   And this is a paper from Emily Balsettis' lab,
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.780]   focuses mainly on physical activities,
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.660]   but it mentioned some other things as well.
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.480]   This is an article published in "Personality
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.580]   and Social Psychology Bulletin" in 2020.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:37.420]   So it's recent, it's an exceptional paper in my opinion,
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.640]   really gets to the heart of how all this works
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.780]   and some examples of where it's been implemented.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.060]   So let's apply this visual tool in a very simple way
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.480]   to any type of goal that you want to pursue.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.120]   If you already know what goal you want to pursue,
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.000]   maybe it's a workout,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.740]   maybe it's a cognitive work of some particular sort.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.400]   Again, the process is very simple.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.380]   You're going to focus your visual attention on one point
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.260]   beyond your peripersonal space.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.360]   So it could be on your computer, it could be on the wall,
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.040]   it could be a horizon, it could be at a distance,
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.260]   and you're going to focus your visual attention there.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.100]   And with some effort,
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.560]   you're going to hold your visual attention
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.300]   for 30 to 60 seconds.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.080]   You might blink, that's okay,
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.060]   but you're going to try and hold your visual attention there
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.780]   so no moving your head around,
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.740]   no diverting your attention to other locations.
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.300]   Some people will find it very easy to do,
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.020]   other people will find it quite hard.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.660]   Your mind may drift cognitively, that's okay,
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.440]   but try and bring your visual attention
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.620]   to that common point.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.780]   Several episodes ago,
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.700]   I talked about how there are actually studies
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.280]   looking at developing this kind of training in students
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.720]   for ADHD and the data on that are actually quite encouraging.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.240]   So for people who have ADHD and focus issues
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.340]   and attentional issues, this can be effective.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.280]   For people who don't, this can also be effective.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.220]   Again, it places your brain and body
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.420]   into a state of readiness,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.460]   and then the idea is to move into the particular actions
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.260]   that bring you closer to your goal, okay?
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.260]   We haven't yet talked about how to set goals
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.420]   and how to assess progress.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.500]   This is simply how to pursue goals, okay?
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.900]   But the visual component is important.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.740]   In fact, I would argue that the visual system
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.300]   and harnessing your visual attention to a narrow point
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.340]   is going to be the most effective way
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.700]   to get your brain and body into a mode of action
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.820]   to pursue whatever goal it is you're trying to pursue.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.620]   That practice is in stark contrast to multitasking,
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.920]   where, by definition, your attention is moving
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.660]   from place to place to place, right?
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.760]   I mentioned that multitasking can be effective
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.620]   in getting your system into somewhat
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.080]   of an increased level of activation
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.860]   so that you can pursue a more focused goal.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.180]   But the visual attention to a particular point
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.800]   is going to be the most effective way
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.620]   to bring your system into a state of readiness
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.160]   and action for goal pursuit.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.820]   There's another really interesting way
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.700]   that you can leverage your visual system
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.620]   toward long-term goals.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.380]   The Balcetas Lab has also done
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.860]   some really interesting experiments
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.620]   looking at people's ability to set
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.260]   and stick to long-term goals.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.580]   And the long-term goal that they looked at
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.600]   was one related to saving money for later in life.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.380]   This is something that a lot of people struggle with.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:02.420]   A lot of people have a hard time investing money
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.080]   or saving money for later in life,
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.160]   simply because as human beings,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.820]   we vary in the extent to which we worry
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.800]   about what's going to happen later.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.400]   There's also a phenomenon of so-called delayed discounting.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.400]   Delayed discounting is the fact
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.700]   that goals become less rewarding
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.260]   when they exist further out in the future, okay?
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.460]   You may have experienced this walking past a donut shop.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.300]   I love donuts.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.020]   I'm just going to admit it over and over again on this spot.
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:26.940]   I love the smell of them.
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:27.920]   I love the taste of them.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.760]   I try not to eat them
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.300]   'cause I'm told they're not that good for me.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   And indeed, I don't think they are.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.060]   I occasionally cave and I eat one or many.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.860]   But in general, I try not to cave
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.080]   to the immediately rewarding properties
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.860]   of the smell and the taste of the donut.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.500]   But what we know is that if you smell a donut
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.960]   or you smell a wonderful piece of food,
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.920]   in the immediate term, it brings your level of focus,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.560]   your mental focus, to the immediate phase.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.920]   And it feels very rewarding.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.560]   Like if you had it now, it would just be so good.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.480]   But if you actually extend that reward out to tomorrow
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.660]   or the next day, you think, oh, you know,
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.560]   today happens to be a Saturday that we're recording,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.320]   but oh, you know, on Tuesday morning,
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.460]   I'm going to get a donut.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.040]   It doesn't have the same value
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.860]   because the reward system doesn't work as well
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.640]   for long-term goals.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.180]   It's not as salient.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.940]   It's not as tangible a goal,
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.560]   especially for something like a donut.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.500]   Whereas the kinds of goals that work
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.320]   when you place them out into the longer term
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.380]   and can create a heightened sense of motivation
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.600]   tend to be things that are much more rewarding to us.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.160]   So delayed discounting simply says
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.880]   that the further out in time that a given goal is,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.380]   the less effective that reward will be
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.980]   in motivating one's behavior.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.720]   And indeed, you see this with saving money for retirement.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.320]   You see this with all sorts of long-term investment.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.140]   The Balsettis lab therefore did an experiment
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.320]   where they looked at people's tendency
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.160]   to save money for later in life.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.760]   But the groups that they created in the study
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.600]   were really interesting.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.520]   They had one group imagine what it would be like
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.040]   to be 30 or 40 years older,
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.840]   and then to invest a certain amount of money
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.280]   according to whatever it is
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.400]   they thought that they would need.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   And they measured the amount that they had set aside
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.000]   and saved for later in life.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.500]   The other group actually viewed photos of themselves.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.480]   So picture images of themselves
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.920]   that were artificially digitally aged
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.400]   so that they could see themselves
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.020]   30 or 40 years into the future.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.520]   And it turns out that people in that second group
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:32.440]   simply by perceiving their own image in the future
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.920]   invested far more money into later life.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.960]   They set aside more money.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.440]   Somehow it bridged the gap
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.520]   between their immediate experience of life
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.160]   and the longer arc toward what it was going to be like
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.640]   in 30 or 40 years.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.660]   So very powerful result in my opinion,
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.160]   because what it says again
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.880]   is that our visual perception of the future
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.480]   or our visual perception of the present
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   is what allows us to anchor our goal-directed systems
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.280]   and our motivation to take on things
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.200]   that in the immediate term might not seem that useful.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.480]   So you can imagine all sorts of variations on this.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.680]   You can imagine that every time I want a donut,
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.360]   I'd see a vision of myself
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:14.160]   or an actual physical picture of myself
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.320]   as a consequence of that,
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.080]   having eaten many donuts every day for the next 10 years.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.200]   I don't know what that image would look like
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   'cause I've never seen it.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.160]   That's not an experiment that I necessarily need to do
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.600]   because I'm not that motivated to eat donuts.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.400]   But I have to confess,
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.320]   somebody who I think I'm pretty good at managing resources,
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.460]   but I think if I were to see an image of myself at 70 or 75,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.760]   there's so many things that are associated
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.400]   with visual images, like what our body must feel like,
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.480]   what our needs are probably going to be like in that state
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.920]   or in that age,
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.740]   what sorts of things we may or may not still be able to do
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:47.760]   at that age.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.800]   And that anchors back to immediate goal-directed behaviors,
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.840]   such as setting aside money for retirement,
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.600]   such as investing in one's health practices.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.920]   And indeed, there's a study that has looked at
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.060]   how people will invest in exercise and healthy eating.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.220]   If they just think about the future
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.700]   and what they might be like in the future
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.560]   versus seeing images of themselves in the future
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.420]   if they were to go down a healthy or unhealthy route.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.820]   So again, the point is that the visual system,
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.740]   what we see is principally important
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.900]   in defining what we do in the immediate term,
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.520]   even if what we see relates to something
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.560]   in the far off distance.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.080]   I think these are phenomenal studies
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.280]   and they get right down to an important issue
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.360]   that's been kicked around over and over in the literature
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.800]   and in the discussion about goal-seeking,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.440]   which is visualization.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.380]   We hear keep the big goal in mind, focus on the big goal.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.740]   So now we're going to address what does the science say
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.480]   about visualizing big goals?
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.340]   If you're somebody who's interested in business,
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.500]   or let's say you're focused on relationship,
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.860]   is thinking about the perfect relationship
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:50.960]   and what that would look like
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.600]   and the family that you would have and where you would live,
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.380]   is that effective in generating the kinds of behaviors
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.480]   that will lead you to that?
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.740]   Is it effective to think about the big win at the end?
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.600]   Well, it turns out it is,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.080]   but you have to be very, very careful with when
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.020]   and how you implement that visualization,
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.600]   'cause if you do it correctly,
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.660]   it can really serve your goal-seeking well.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.140]   And if you do it incorrectly,
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.520]   it can undermine the entire process.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.040]   So does visualization work?
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.400]   Well, turns out that visualization of the big win,
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.820]   the end goal, so the Super Bowl win,
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.480]   or eight gold medals in the Olympics,
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.020]   or graduation from the university of your choice,
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.400]   or making a certain amount of money,
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.720]   or finding the partner of your choice, et cetera,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.060]   that visualization is effective
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:40.360]   in getting the goal pursuit process started,
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.660]   but it actually is a pretty lousy
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.780]   and maybe even counterproductive way
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.040]   of maintaining pursuit of that goal,
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.300]   meaning continuing to engage the sort of actions
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.180]   that are going to get you to eventually achieve that goal.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.440]   I think this is going to be surprising to people at first,
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.120]   but if we think back to our discussion
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.960]   about the physiology of the blood pressure system,
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   it'll make sense.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.420]   Good scientific studies have been done
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.800]   where people are told to imagine
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.520]   or even script out their long-term vision
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.460]   and goal for themselves.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.520]   What is the big goal?
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.860]   And they're taught to or told to imagine it
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.260]   with a rich amount of detail,
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.160]   to think about how it's going to feel in their body
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.320]   and the big win.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.880]   And basically what happens is
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.240]   if you measure people's blood pressure
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.960]   or other metrics of physiology,
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.360]   you see an increase in that systolic blood pressure.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.640]   There's kind of a ramping up of the readiness
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.900]   and excitement for that goal,
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.120]   but that increase in blood pressure quickly wanes.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.760]   And over time, that visual of the long-term goal
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.240]   becomes a poor thing to rely on
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.640]   in order to generate the actions
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.080]   that are required to reach that goal.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.240]   In fact, there's a much better way
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.680]   to maintain ongoing action toward a goal
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.120]   that also involves visualization,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.520]   but it turns out it's not about visualizing success,
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.680]   it's about visualizing failure.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.000]   The Balcetas Lab and other labs
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.820]   have looked at whether or not people make progress
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.240]   toward goals of different types,
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.020]   whether or not they're thinking about the goal,
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.340]   they're thinking about that goal line
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.720]   and what they want to achieve,
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.560]   that long-term goal and all the wonderful things
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.920]   associated with it,
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.300]   or whether or not they're thinking about all the ways
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.660]   in which they could fail and route to that goal, right?
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.580]   This is not typically what we are encouraged to do.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.860]   Typically, we are told, don't imagine failure,
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:36.180]   push failure out of your mind, only focus on success,
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.300]   fake it till you make it,
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.620]   or it's a phrase that I absolutely hate, frankly,
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.420]   because it's not even clear what that means,
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.120]   and it's not even clear what the ethical form of that is.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.340]   I think it means continue despite any anxiety or fear
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.680]   that things won't work out.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.540]   But if you look at the literature,
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.220]   the scientific literature,
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.180]   what the Balcetas Lab and other labs have shown
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.740]   is that there's a near doubling, near doubling
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.780]   in the probability of reaching one's goal
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.780]   if you focus routinely on foreshadowing failure.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.220]   You think about the ways in which things could fail
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.300]   if you take action A or you take action B,
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.460]   and instead, therefore, you take action C.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.780]   You're supposed to think about how things could fail
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.020]   if you don't get up and run each morning
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.700]   if your goal is, say, a fitness goal.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.460]   So let's use that as an example,
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.020]   because even though I realize people are in pursuit
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.020]   of many things, not just fitness,
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.380]   fitness goals and physical goals are a very concrete thing
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.740]   that we can all get on the same page about
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.860]   'cause they're related to actions.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.840]   Let's say somebody sets a goal of running five miles
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.440]   four times a week minimum and as many as seven
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.640]   four times a week minimum before 8 a.m., okay?
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.060]   In a previous podcast on habits,
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.460]   I talked about the benefits of not necessarily
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.360]   setting specific times that one will do things,
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.340]   but setting time blocks that one will do things.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.300]   So you say before 8 a.m., you're going to run five miles,
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.580]   and that's going to happen up to seven days a week, okay?
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.940]   One version of this would be, okay,
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.300]   sit back in a chair and think about
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.740]   how great you're going to feel and look
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.780]   if you're doing this every day,
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.300]   how your health is going to improve,
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.500]   how everything's going to, your blood markers of lipids,
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.420]   et cetera, are going to improve, okay, fine.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:14.840]   That's the visualization goal of visualizing the end point.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.740]   Turns out that is far less effective
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.460]   and maybe even counterproductive
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.940]   compared to thinking about what's going to happen
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.720]   if you don't do this,
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.020]   the negative health outcomes that are going to occur,
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.980]   the disappointment you're going to have in yourself,
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.380]   the fact that you're going to wait until 7.30,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.140]   that's not long enough for many people to run five miles,
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:33.040]   you got to put it on your shoes,
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.700]   it can be pouring rain or even hailing or snowing outside,
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.540]   and now you're not going outside unless you're somebody
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.260]   who's particularly motivated to do that, okay?
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.620]   So foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.440]   to motivate toward goal pursuit.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.880]   In fact, as I mentioned before,
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.620]   there's a near doubling in the likelihood
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.660]   that people will reach goals of any kind
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.140]   when they're constantly thinking about
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.460]   how bad it's going to be if they fail.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.460]   If we think back to the neural circuit
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:01.060]   associated with assessing value in our goal pursuits,
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.060]   this makes perfect sense.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.780]   The amygdala, that center of the brain
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.280]   that's involved in anxiety and fear and worry,
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.340]   well, the amygdala is one of the four core components
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.540]   of our goal setting and goal pursuit circuitry,
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.100]   and there's no bypassing that,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.820]   there is no one listening to this or watching this
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.460]   whose amygdala is not involved
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.480]   in their goal setting and goal pursuit,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.020]   behavior, and so while I'd love to be able to tell you
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.840]   that all you should think about is rainbows and puppies
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.700]   and all the wonderful, rewarding things
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.400]   that are going to happen when you achieve your goals,
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.100]   the truth is you should be thinking mainly about
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.920]   how bad it's really going to get if you don't do it,
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.820]   how disappointing yourself you're going to feel,
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.420]   how it will negatively impact you,
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.520]   if not in the immediate term, in the longterm,
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.980]   if indeed your goal is to reach your goal.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.160]   So I want to emphasize that I'm not interested
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.540]   in encouraging people to flagellate themselves,
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:54.260]   I'm encouraging people to achieve their goals,
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.780]   and it turns out the best way to do that
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.520]   is by foreshadowing failure,
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.820]   and the more specific you can get by writing down
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.460]   or thinking about or talking about how bad it will be
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.780]   if you don't achieve your goals,
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.740]   the more likely you are to achieve those goals.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.880]   Part of the reason for that almost certainly has to do
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.100]   with increases in systolic blood pressure
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.700]   and increases in readiness in your system
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.900]   when you imagine failure.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.940]   The brain and body are much better at moving away
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.340]   from fearful things than towards things we want.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.900]   I wish I could tell you that wasn't the case,
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.920]   but there is a true asymmetry in the way we are built.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.240]   In fact, the brain and body can engage
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.640]   in what's called one-trial learning.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.220]   When something bad happens, we eat a food that makes us sick,
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.020]   we have an interaction with a person or place
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.420]   that we really don't like,
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.220]   it only takes one trial to really, one event, one time,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.800]   to reorient or rewire our neural circuitry
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.380]   so that we have a bias toward moving away
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.780]   from that thing in the future.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.300]   When things go well, unfortunately, that doesn't often occur.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.820]   If things go really, really well,
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.220]   it might orient our brain and body
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.500]   toward wanting more of that thing
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.180]   and we'll have neural circuitry changes
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.860]   that will lead us to engage in that particular behavior
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.100]   or interaction again,
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.300]   but it is never as effective as these avoidance circuits.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.980]   So again, foreshadow failure.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.420]   If you're going to visualize in a positive way,
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.580]   do that at the very beginning of some goal pursuit,
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.420]   maybe intermittently every once in a while,
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:15.900]   you imagine the big win of scoring perfect on an exam
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.060]   or winning the championship or the great relationship.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.400]   But most of the time, if you want to be effective,
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.500]   you should be focusing on avoiding failure
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.460]   and you should be really clear
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.860]   about what those failures would look like and feel like.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.180]   Now let's talk about goal setting.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.060]   Going back to that prominent literature,
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.740]   the psychology and popular literature again,
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.640]   we can hear some of these themes start to emerge.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.620]   The goal should be significant, we are told.
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.500]   It should be inspirational.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.260]   It should be aggressive yet realistic.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.580]   Well, okay, that's all fine and good,
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.920]   but let's get semi-quantitative about this.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.240]   Let's at least get biological about this.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.800]   How inspirational does it need to be?
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.080]   Is does it need to be the kind of thing
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.820]   that is so inspiring to me that I can't sleep at all?
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.460]   Well, that wouldn't be good because I believe,
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.360]   and I know many of you have heard me say many,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.120]   many times before, regular deep sleep,
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.140]   80% or more of the nights that you go to sleep
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.620]   is going to be crucial to your cognitive
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.980]   and mental functioning and your ability
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.740]   to achieve your goals in the longterm.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.100]   That's absolutely clear.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.660]   So it's got to be inspirational and exciting,
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.200]   but what does that really look like?
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.640]   And what does that correspond to?
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.780]   And how do we actually make that happen?
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.600]   Well, once again, there is a mismatch
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.300]   between what the real data show
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.000]   and what we're most often told.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.620]   Turns out that, again, work in Balsetto's lab,
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.120]   but also other laboratories has addressed
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   whether or not the probability of achieving a goal
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.100]   goes up or down depending on whether or not
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.700]   one visualizes or sets a goal that is easy,
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.480]   moderate or impossible.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.720]   Okay, an impossible goal would be, for instance,
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.860]   if I say, you know, I'm going to jump from my front driveway
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.160]   all the way up to the road,
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.560]   the road's quite a distance away,
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.560]   it's more than 20 meters away, it's just not going to happen.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.640]   It's not going to happen in this lifetime,
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   it's not going to happen in any other lifetime,
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.200]   not unless it involves some elaborate technology
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.340]   that I'm not aware of, a jet pack or something like that.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.420]   It's just not going to happen, right?
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.120]   An easy goal would be something like, can you jump,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.900]   or could I jump, you know, two feet in front of me?
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.740]   Obviously, yes.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.440]   Okay, now I'm using a trivial example here,
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.500]   but this could be translated to any kind of goal,
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.840]   school goal, physical goal, et cetera.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.800]   Turns out that when people set goals,
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.320]   whether or not they are nutritional goals,
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.120]   eat more of this or eat less of that,
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.600]   whether or not they're fitness goals,
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.760]   you know, run more, lift more,
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.400]   or some other goal, swim less, swim more,
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.440]   whatever it is their goal happens to be,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   some learning goal, some relationship goal,
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.000]   some attempt to modify their behavior,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.560]   turns out that if the goal is too easy,
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.320]   it's too within reach,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:49.240]   it doesn't recruit enough of the autonomic nervous system
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.920]   to make pursuit of that goal likely.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.180]   Now that might be surprising.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.240]   At least it was surprising to me.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.640]   You think, well, something is really, really easy.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.900]   You know, there's a very low bar to achieve it.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.640]   People are probably more likely to do it,
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.940]   but it turns out that's not the case.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.980]   When we hear that a goal needs to be inspirational,
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.920]   what do we mean?
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.260]   When we hear that something's too easy
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.900]   to recruit our action, what do we mean?
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.200]   Well, Balsettia's lab measures systolic blood pressure
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.760]   and found that when goals were too easy
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.960]   for people to attain,
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.200]   they didn't get that increase in systolic blood pressure
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.680]   and recruitment of the other neural and vascular systems,
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.700]   meaning the blood systems and the nervous system,
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.600]   that would place them into ongoing effort.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.000]   And so they quickly gave up.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.880]   Also, if a goal was too lofty,
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.440]   if it was too far from their current abilities,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.220]   it didn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.360]   Even if people could get very excited
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.780]   about something mentally,
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.860]   it simply didn't place their body into a state of readiness
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.460]   because it wasn't tangible that they could actually
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.540]   perhaps really achieve it.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.060]   So it turns out that when goals were moderate,
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.200]   when they were just outside of one's immediate abilities,
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.100]   or that one felt that, yeah, that would take a lot of effort,
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:00.460]   but it's within range or maybe in range,
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.980]   like maybe I can do it, maybe I can't,
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.940]   then there was a near doubling
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.220]   of the systolic blood pressure in the good sense.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.240]   It didn't go into the unhealthy range
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.640]   and a doubling or more of the likelihood
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.000]   that they would engage in the ongoing pursuit
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.400]   of that particular goal.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.760]   So here we're talking about goal setting.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.000]   What we're saying is set goals that are realistic,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.460]   but that aren't so realistic that they're easy.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.900]   The goals need to be realistic and truly challenging.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.100]   Don't set goals that are so challenging and so lofty
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.480]   that they crash that blood pressure system
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.420]   in the other direction and make you
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.260]   or anyone feel unmotivated.
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.600]   In hearing this, it makes sense,
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.120]   but I don't think I would have predicted it
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.700]   had they not done this very controlled study.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.780]   I would have thought the loftier the goal,
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.820]   the bigger the goal,
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:51.300]   the more that it recruits the autonomic system
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.180]   and the more that people are likely to lean into the energy
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:57.020]   and effort to pursue and attain that goal.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.720]   I also would have thought that if a goal
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.740]   is really easy to achieve,
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.100]   that it would engage the systems of action
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.140]   in the brain and body enough
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.740]   that people would sort of get into motion
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.580]   and pursue that goal.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.540]   But neither is the case.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.740]   Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve,
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.180]   but that are not so lofty that they collapse your system
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.440]   and that you feel overwhelmed.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.200]   And the important thing here is that how we perceive a goal,
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.300]   whether or not we think it's within reach or not,
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.820]   of course will vary depending on whether or not we are
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.880]   rested, depending on whether or not other aspects
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.300]   of our life are going well.
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.020]   I mean, we can think that we are hot on the heels
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.660]   of a lifetime goal and everything's going well.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:39.300]   And then there'll be some crisis, interpersonal crisis,
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.540]   or there'll be a health crisis and you'll be shut down.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:44.140]   And then that goal seems very, very hard to attain.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.560]   So we will talk about how to update goals
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.500]   under different contexts in a few minutes.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.740]   But of course, this is going to be an averaging.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.660]   This isn't something that you do just once.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.180]   But the takeaway again is very simple,
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.980]   set goals that are moderately hard to hard,
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.460]   but not so hard nor so easy
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.380]   that they don't engage your brain and body properly.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:06.220]   Moderate goals are best if you want to achieve your goals.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.380]   Now I'd like to talk about three particular areas
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:12.180]   of scientific study that point to goal pursuit,
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.220]   goal assessment, and goal achievement.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:20.540]   Previously, I told you that it's great to foreshadow failure
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.120]   that that's a great way to get your system
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.420]   into a state of activation.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.060]   I also told you that you want to set goals
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.540]   that are challenging, but possible.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.180]   And again, here I'm paraphrasing
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.700]   from the work of Emily Balcettas.
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.660]   I want to be very clear.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.640]   There are a few other things that one can do
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.380]   in order to bias the likelihood that you will succeed
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.100]   in trying to achieve your goals.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.520]   First of all, limit your options.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.780]   Trying to pursue too many goals at once
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.380]   can definitely be counterproductive.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.780]   Now I realize that life is complicated.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.220]   We all have multiple goals that we're trying to pursue.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.180]   But if we have particular goals that are important to us,
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.300]   we have to be careful to not get distracted by other goals.
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.060]   And many people run into this problem.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:05.260]   So setting one or two or maybe three major goals
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.780]   for a given year is going to be more than enough
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.020]   for most people and is actually going to be challenging
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.060]   for most people.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.980]   Now, of course, we have daily goals and monthly goals
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:15.820]   and yearly goals, but if we have big lofty goals,
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.660]   we need to be careful not to contaminate our mental space
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.500]   and our visual space with too many goals.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.220]   And why do I say visual goals?
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:26.480]   Well, what various department stores and supermarkets
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.060]   have discovered is that the greater the number of things
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.700]   in our visual attention,
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:36.320]   the more that we can draw our attention and our goals
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.660]   off a line of pursuit.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.760]   What does that mean?
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.620]   Well, let's think about it in the practical context.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.180]   This has actually been done.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:43.980]   Big department stores have figured out
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.460]   that if they stock their shelves chock-a-block
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:50.040]   with many, many options of food or clothing items
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.960]   or objects or anything like that,
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.880]   people simply buy more stuff.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.660]   People are very prone to orienting their attention
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.780]   to whatever's in front of them.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.980]   You put a lot of stuff in front of them,
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:01.820]   their attention drifts.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.700]   You put fewer things in front of them,
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.920]   their attention is more narrow.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.980]   In a later episode, we'll talk about designing a workspace
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.020]   that's optimized on the basis of this.
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.880]   It doesn't mean being in a room with nothing
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.760]   except just your desk and a computer.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.920]   It doesn't have to be that sparse,
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   but visual sparseness actually can help us orient our focus
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.100]   and our behavior.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   When we have a lot of things in our visual environment
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.120]   or a lot of things in our cognitive environment,
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.300]   it's the same thing.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.920]   And so if you're going to try and pursue a fitness goal,
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.060]   a relationship goal, an academic goal,
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.300]   and a long-term life financial goal all at once,
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.460]   that's four things.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.140]   And you're going to have to come up with systems
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:42.540]   that allow you to isolate those goals in a very rigid way.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.020]   And if you do have multiple interleaving goals
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.820]   and overlapping goals and simultaneous goals,
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.580]   in a few minutes, we're going to talk about a process
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.080]   that will allow you to use your visual system
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.000]   to align towards each of those goals sequentially
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.820]   in a way that makes it much more likely
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:57.960]   that you'll achieve them.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.160]   So now let's talk about specificity of goals.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.680]   We've all heard that the more specific a goal is
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.620]   and the more specific we are about
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.540]   when and how we are going to execute that goal,
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.580]   the higher probability
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.340]   that we will actually achieve that goal.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.420]   And indeed that's the case,
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.980]   but there's an additional feature
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.220]   that's not often discussed that is vitally important
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.380]   and in fact, maybe more important
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.200]   than having a specific time of day
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.080]   or a specific end point in mind.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.800]   There's a really nice study
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.420]   that was done looking at recycling.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.520]   And this is something that a number of groups,
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.240]   businesses, households, and individuals
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.680]   are trying to do more of.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.200]   They're trying to lower carbon footprint
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.420]   or contribute to the world in some general way
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.760]   by throwing away fewer things
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.840]   that could potentially be recycled.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840]   So this has been studied
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.080]   in the context of the work environment
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.360]   where a business decides and lets everybody know
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.600]   that there's going to be a greater effort
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.000]   toward recycling cans or bottles
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.720]   or bottles and cans, et cetera.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.900]   And then the way these studies were done
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.940]   is that the janitorial staff was swapped out temporarily
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.740]   for researchers that actually measured
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.140]   the number of recyclable items
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.280]   that showed up in the trash and not in the recycle
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.780]   as a function of the total amount of trash.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.340]   Why did I say as a function of the total amount of trash?
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.600]   Well, it's a way of controlling for differences
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.440]   in beverage consumption from one week to the next.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.600]   Anyway, the point is they were able
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.120]   to very carefully measure how much people are recycling
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.300]   before and after this call to action to recycle more.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.660]   What they found was if they said,
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.480]   we are going to try and recycle more,
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.180]   try not to put cans and bottles in the trash,
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:41.360]   there of course was an improvement in recycling,
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.260]   but it was pretty modest.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:46.580]   Whereas when there was a very concrete plan
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.760]   and everyone knew what that concrete plan was,
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.360]   for instance, to place all bottles and cans
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.320]   into the recycle, not the trash,
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.820]   or to limit the amount of trash by 50%
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.180]   or to eliminate all recyclable items from the trash.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.920]   So when they made it very concrete,
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.880]   exactly what the action steps were,
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.680]   there was a remarkable, I mean,
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.800]   close to a hundred fold or more improvement
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.840]   in recycling behavior that lasted many months
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.620]   after this call to action was made.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.460]   The takeaway from this is quite straightforward.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:22.740]   It means that having a concrete plan is essential.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.200]   You can't just say, I'm going to become a better recycler,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.280]   or I'm going to do things that are better for the environment
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.640]   or I'm going to become more physically fit.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.240]   It has to be a specific set of action steps
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.120]   that get right down to details
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.760]   about what success would look like.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.040]   I've heard this before described
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.840]   as what does right look like?
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.040]   What is the actual outcome that one would like to achieve
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.720]   in terms of action steps?
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.480]   So not necessarily feeling states.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.860]   It wasn't that they all sat around and said,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.400]   how great we're all going to feel about ourselves
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.480]   and the world when we accomplish this goal.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.680]   It was very concrete statements,
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.600]   very concrete plans about action steps
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.520]   that would deliver one to one's goal.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.520]   Somewhat straightforward and intuitive,
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.700]   but nonetheless worthwhile.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.800]   What it suggests is that for all of us,
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.020]   if we have certain goals that we want to achieve,
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.840]   we need to be exquisitely detailed
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.560]   about what the action steps are that we're going to take
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.900]   and to constantly update those action steps
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.420]   so that we have a higher probability
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.200]   of meeting those action steps.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.460]   Some of you may be asking,
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:24.240]   how often should one assess progress?
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.320]   Well, that of course will depend on the given goal
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.640]   that you're trying to pursue.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.940]   But in the studies that I've been referring to here,
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.480]   the assessment of progress
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.900]   and the updating of concrete plans was done weekly.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.760]   So it seems like weekly is a good starting place
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.080]   to address how well one performed in the previous week
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.960]   and then based on that performance
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.680]   to update the action plan for the upcoming week.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.880]   So weekly seems like a good solid rule of thumb
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.560]   for setting particular action goals
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.720]   and assessing one's progress
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.400]   towards the immediate and longer term goals.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.360]   Any discussion about goals and goal pursuit
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.320]   would be incomplete without a discussion
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.200]   about the molecule dopamine.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.600]   Dopamine is often thought of
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.000]   as the molecule of pleasure and reward,
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.560]   but actually it is the molecule of motivation.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.580]   This is best illustrated by a classic set of studies
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.640]   that have been carried out in both animals and in humans.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.060]   The animal study can be described the following way.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.560]   Two rats, each in a separate cage.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.000]   You can provide those rats with the opportunity
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.220]   to indulge in something that they like,
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:34.220]   like food or mating or heat if it's cold in the environment
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.740]   or a cool spot in the cage,
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:39.560]   if it's warm in the environment and so forth.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:43.820]   And what you find is that rats will very readily approach
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.160]   the rewarding thing.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.920]   They will mate, they will eat,
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.880]   they will pursue something that is of pleasure.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.280]   Now, if you are to take one of those rats
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.200]   and deplete its dopamine neurons,
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.780]   you can eliminate its dopamine neurons
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.960]   or block dopamine in the brain.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.140]   What you find is that those animals
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.720]   will still enjoy pleasure.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.560]   They will consume the food, they will mate, et cetera.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.760]   However, their motivation to achieve pleasure
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.700]   is vastly reduced.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.240]   In fact, if you place the item of pleasure,
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.320]   the mate, the food, et cetera,
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.600]   even just one rat's length away from that rat,
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.120]   the rat without dopamine will not even move
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.000]   one length of its own body
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   in order to achieve that pleasure.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.280]   And there are naturally occurring experiments in humans
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:34.060]   that mimic that result very accurately.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.220]   There are certain conditions in humans
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.820]   where there's a depletion of dopamine.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.820]   And what you find is that the depletion of dopamine
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.740]   does not inhibit an ability
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:45.100]   to experience pleasure necessarily.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.460]   It inhibits an ability to pursue
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.900]   or go through the series of action steps
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.080]   in order to achieve pleasure.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.240]   So dopamine really sits at the heart
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.940]   of our motivational state to seek out goals
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.100]   and to seek pleasure.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.240]   And this is true for immediate goals
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.360]   that take place within a timeframe of minutes
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.760]   or a timeframe of a day or the timeframe of a week
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.000]   or the timeframe of a lifetime.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.960]   Dopamine is the common currency by which we pursue goals.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.120]   Now, dopamine does a number of things
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.620]   that are very interesting.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.920]   I'm going to describe a few of them
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.720]   as they relate to goal-seeking behavior.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.560]   First of all, there's a fundamental feature
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.680]   of how our brain releases and uses dopamine
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.640]   that's called reward prediction error.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.440]   And the simplest way to think about dopamine
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.160]   reward prediction error
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.760]   is that dopamine is released in the greatest amount
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.440]   and places us into a greater state of motivation
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.640]   when something happens that's positive and novel.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.840]   Now, an important thing to understand about dopamine
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.520]   is that it's not always released on the same schedule.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.480]   There are a couple of different ways
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.600]   that dopamine is released.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.640]   And when it is released relative to your anticipation
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.080]   of a reward is key.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.000]   If you don't expect something positive to happen,
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.220]   you're just going about your day
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.900]   and something positive happens,
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:09.400]   dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.560]   I had this happen recently.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.120]   I had no idea that I was going to be receiving
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.080]   something in the mail, but I went to the mail,
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.720]   I looked in the mail and I got something very positive
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.400]   and I was really, really excited about that.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.060]   This is a real event that happened just today.
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:26.880]   However, if we anticipate something positive
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.740]   is going to happen, and then that thing happens,
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:34.320]   we experienced dopamine as part of the anticipation.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.460]   So even before we get the reward,
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.280]   there's an increase in dopamine.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.840]   It's not as high as it would be if something really novel
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.720]   and unexpected and positive happened,
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.440]   but we do get an increase in dopamine.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.340]   And then when we actually experienced the reward,
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.100]   we experienced the positive thing,
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.360]   there's a smaller increase in dopamine.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.320]   So again, the biggest increases in dopamine
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.520]   are response to things that are positive and unexpected.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.880]   Lesser dopamine is released
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.840]   when we anticipate something good will happen.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.280]   And when that happens, yes, we get some dopamine
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.540]   and we also get some dopamine
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.720]   when the positive thing happens.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.020]   Think about anticipating a great meal with friends.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.360]   We have some dopamine churning, friends come over,
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.480]   then we have the meal and we also get some dopamine
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.160]   from that, but not nearly as much as we would
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.480]   if it had all happened as a part of a big surprise.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.920]   Then there's also the case in which we predict
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.100]   that something good will happen.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.160]   When that happens, there's an increase in dopamine
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.640]   just as there was before.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.200]   But then if that thing doesn't happen,
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.300]   for instance, our friends don't show up for dinner,
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.380]   then there's a drop in dopamine below our initial baseline.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.240]   That drop in dopamine is the chemical essence
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.600]   of what we call disappointment.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.660]   Now, this dopamine reward prediction error, as it's called,
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.920]   can be leveraged toward trying to reach our goals
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.440]   because it tells us where we should set our milestones.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.680]   We can't be in a mode of simply being focused
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.240]   on the finish line.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.340]   Very few people can do that over long periods of time
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.400]   in a way that's effective.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.760]   Now, earlier I talked about a study
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.080]   where people were focused on a finish line visually
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.400]   and they were moving through space
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.560]   with these ankle weights on,
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.780]   but that was a very short-term goal, okay?
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.480]   So if a goal is within minutes or maybe even within an hour
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.360]   or is in with our immediate visuals environment,
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.620]   maybe we can do that.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:24.460]   But most goals of the sort that most people are pursuing,
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.300]   fitness goals, academic goals, business goals,
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.940]   relationship goals, et cetera, involve some milestones.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:34.280]   So understanding what we know about reward prediction error,
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.840]   we can make better choices
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.920]   about where to place the milestones,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.180]   how far out in the future to place milestones.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.440]   So then the question becomes how often
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.240]   or at what intervals should one assess progress?
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.100]   And it turns out this is very subjective,
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.760]   but that there's a way to make it objective.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.280]   Now, in a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.960]   I had a discussion with the great Robert Sapolsky.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.360]   And we were talking about how the brain
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.540]   can subjectively change whether or not a given behavior
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.520]   or experience is positive or negative.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.400]   And the example that Robert gave is a really phenomenal one.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.140]   It's a study that's been done in rats and also in humans,
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.800]   where it took a rat and they had a rat
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.740]   run on a running wheel.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.720]   Rats, turns out, like to run on running wheels.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.840]   And the blood pressure of that animal,
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.800]   the health metrics for that animal, the lipid profiles,
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.440]   many, many things improved.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.500]   Okay, the rat was exercising and it got healthier
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.560]   and presumably got happier.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.400]   We don't know.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.380]   We could have asked it, but we wouldn't know.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.700]   Doesn't know how to tell us, but we can measure blood lipids.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.160]   We can measure blood pressure and all sorts of things.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.720]   And indeed, when that rat exercised
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.080]   or when people exercise, they generally get healthier.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.240]   Except in that particular experiment,
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.240]   they had another animal where every time rat number one ran,
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.480]   rat number two was forced to run.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.440]   It was on a running wheel and it was forced to run,
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.640]   not because it wanted to, but because it was forced to.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:01.720]   And what was remarkable is that the physiological effects
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.720]   of being forced to do something
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.560]   were in the complete opposite direction as they were
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.560]   when those same behaviors were undertaken voluntarily.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.180]   In other words, the rat that was choosing to run
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:15.400]   got healthier and the rat that was forced to run
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.480]   became unhealthy.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.100]   Blood pressure went up in a direction
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.720]   that wasn't effective and useful.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.860]   Blood lipids got worse.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.880]   Stress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.020]   And you see the same thing in humans.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:29.920]   Now, what this says is that our subjective understanding
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.840]   of why we are doing something is fundamentally important
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.560]   for the effects that we will get from that behavior.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.560]   And indeed the effects that that behavior will have on us.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.480]   So this has two major implications.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.040]   First of all, in terms of reward schedules,
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.560]   we can decide to use any reward schedule
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.420]   that we want for a given behavior.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:51.580]   We can decide that the milestones for a,
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:54.040]   let's say a plan of getting in really terrific
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.100]   cardiovascular shape over the next year,
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:00.440]   we can decide to assess every day and ask ourselves,
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.560]   how good was our progress?
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   And if we made progress,
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.740]   then we're going to reward ourselves.
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.420]   We could do that every third day.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.760]   We could do it every week.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.140]   We could do it every five minutes
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.200]   if we actually had the time to do that.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.760]   The reward schedule, the dopamine system
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.960]   is highly susceptible to the subjective effects,
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.640]   the so-called top-down effects of when we decide
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.640]   that something is going to be good for us,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.160]   if we analyze it on a given timeframe,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.320]   well, then it's going to be good for us.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.000]   So what I suggest people do is pick a particular interval
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.040]   at which they are going to assess progress.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.320]   And if you've been making regular progress towards a goal
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.000]   that you reward yourself and the reward indeed
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.320]   is all cognitive, it's all mental.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.100]   It's telling yourself, yes, I'm on the right track.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.320]   Now, some people will say, wait,
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.760]   but I want to know exactly how often I should do that.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.040]   You need to do that at an interval
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.580]   that you can maintain consistently, okay?
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.440]   So you're not going to reward yourself every minute
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.880]   or every step of every jog that you take,
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.760]   unless you can do it every minute of every step
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.040]   of every jog that you take.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.720]   For that reason, I think that daily
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.780]   or ideally weekly assessments are going to be best.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.380]   I think that checking in at the end of a week,
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:08.840]   looking back on the previous week
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.120]   and assessing how well you performed
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.740]   in pursuit of a given goal,
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.520]   how many times a week you ran
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.760]   or how many times you studied
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.760]   or how many times you did something that you wanted to do
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.760]   or avoided something that you didn't want to do.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.300]   I think that's a reasonable and tractable schedule
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.640]   to assess once a week.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.840]   So that's one point that pick a milestone
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.640]   that you can maintain consistently
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.880]   throughout the pursuit of a goal.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.560]   The second thing is that the subjective effects
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.080]   that were described by that Sapolsky study
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.880]   or that Sapolsky described rather
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.840]   are absolutely essential
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.360]   for all aspects of goal-seeking behavior.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.440]   We cannot underestimate the extent
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.040]   to which the dopamine system
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.520]   and our sense of whether or not we are on the right track
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.020]   is under our cognitive control.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.440]   If we constantly place ourselves
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.380]   into a mode of thinking that we are failing,
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.880]   well, then indeed,
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.000]   we are not going to churn out much dopamine.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.160]   Now, earlier I said we need to predict
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:08.860]   and visualize failure,
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.680]   but that is not the same thing
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.280]   as thinking about ourselves as failing.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.940]   We need to predict what the outcome would be if we failed,
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.880]   but then encountering that
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.540]   and in behaving in a certain way
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:21.560]   and thinking in a certain way
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.700]   and pursuing our goals in an effective way,
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.480]   maybe checking in on that each week,
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.620]   we definitely need to reward ourselves cognitively
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.680]   for the correct and successful pursuit.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.640]   What this means is that anticipate and think about failure
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.080]   as a mechanism of generating motivation
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.620]   and indeed fear and anxiety
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.560]   so that you lean into the correct behaviors
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.640]   and you lean away from the incorrect behaviors
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.800]   to reach your goal.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.500]   But then weekly or so,
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.700]   whatever you can maintain consistently,
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.500]   you absolutely want to reward yourself cognitively
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.480]   by telling yourself I'm on the right track.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.620]   I got another week where I accomplished
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.800]   whatever it is that I'm trying to accomplish.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.540]   A concrete example that I'm following now
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.500]   is this 150 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.280]   because that's shown to be very effective
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:07.540]   in improving mental and physical health metrics.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.200]   So once a week, I'll check in with myself.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.240]   If I reach that 150 to 200 minute threshold,
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:15.780]   then I'll reward myself simply by checking off a box
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:19.020]   and saying, okay, I'm on track, I'm on track, I'm on track.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:22.160]   This dopamine system is critical to re-up,
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.000]   to remind ourselves that we are on track
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.680]   if indeed we are on track
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:30.040]   because dopamine itself provides a state of motivation
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.640]   and readiness to continue
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.480]   in the regular pursuit of our goals.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.260]   Dopamine, the molecule is actually used
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.800]   to manufacture epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.000]   which are other molecules in our brain and body
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.420]   which put us into that readiness and action state.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.200]   They're actually the molecules that help generate
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.280]   that increase in systolic blood pressure
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.860]   that puts us into a state of readiness.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:55.740]   So you can think about dopamine as a self-amplifying system
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:59.640]   provided that you are leveraging the dopamine system
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.800]   on a consistent schedule.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:05.200]   Now, by also following a consistent schedule of self-reward,
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:09.600]   you set yourself up for any positive unanticipated rewards
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.560]   that may happen.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.400]   So for instance, if you're checking in with yourself weekly,
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.800]   telling yourself that you're doing well if indeed you are,
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:19.140]   and then out of nowhere, for instance, you're out on a run
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:21.280]   or you're doing something, I'm using fitness as an example,
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.120]   but you're doing something,
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.200]   you find yourself performing particularly well,
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.960]   that's a unexpected dopamine reward
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.380]   that will further amplify the system.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:31.000]   Now, I know many people out there
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.300]   having heard me talk about dopamine before worry,
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.340]   well, can I release too much dopamine?
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.760]   And then the whole system will crash
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.520]   and then I'll run out of motivation.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.320]   In general, that doesn't happen
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.280]   unless people are using pharmacology supplements
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.640]   or prescription drugs or illicit drugs to increase dopamine.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.000]   This is why I'm a big fan of things like cold showers
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.720]   and cold water exposure,
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.980]   which has been shown to lead to long lasting
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:57.480]   2.5 X increases in dopamine,
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.360]   or in some cases supplementation with things like L-tyrosine
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.960]   which are precursors to dopamine,
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.080]   or in some cases caffeine
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.280]   which can increase the number of dopamine receptors
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.140]   that we have so that whatever dopamine we have
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.260]   floating around can be more effective
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.920]   in activating these motivational states.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.920]   But things that really increase dopamine
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.480]   and then cause it to crash can be problematic.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.120]   One way to conceive of dopamine
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.400]   is as a sort of dopamine wave pool.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.640]   You've probably seen these wave pools
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.920]   where some pressure is pushed into the pool
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.380]   and then you get these waves going.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.260]   If those waves are consistent enough
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:31.040]   and they're of high enough amplitude,
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.100]   the waves can continue to go up and down and up and down.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.560]   But if it's a giant wave,
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.000]   if you get a huge blast of dopamine,
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.820]   well then a bunch of the water sloshes out of the wave pool
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.400]   and then you basically have to take some time off,
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.780]   reset that dopamine level.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.000]   That's what happens in addiction
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.800]   and when people start pushing in a lot of drugs
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.900]   or other things into the system
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.820]   that increase dopamine too much.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.320]   So today we've almost exclusively
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.720]   been talking about behavioral tools.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.680]   It is possible to incorporate supplements
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.520]   and things of that sort that can increase dopamine
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.120]   as a way to getting into ongoing motivational states.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.800]   But I caution people about relying on those too much.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.520]   Really what you want is you want a situation
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.500]   where your own positive feedback,
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.080]   your own understanding that you are reaching the milestones
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.160]   that you've set out for yourself,
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.640]   that you're achieving those
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.520]   and that is what's causing these waves
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.860]   or these increases in dopamine
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.880]   that will further amplify your motivational states.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.280]   Another very interesting aspect of dopamine
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.360]   that I've not talked about at all on this podcast before
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.440]   is actually how the dopamine system
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.680]   interacts with the visual system.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.220]   We've talked a lot about how harnessing your visual attention
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.440]   to a particular point is great
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.800]   and can help serve your ability
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.960]   to both set and achieve goals.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.820]   Really wonderful work that was done by Wolfram Schultz,
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.680]   who's one of the great pioneers in this area of dopamine
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.720]   and dopamine reward prediction error,
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.880]   showed that for people that have normal levels of dopamine,
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.960]   their visual search,
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.720]   meaning how they scanned visual environments
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.020]   tends to be pretty constrained.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.040]   They might move their eyes
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.060]   around a particular visual environment searching somewhat.
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.740]   For people that lack dopamine,
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:13.320]   they actually have very little movement of their eyes.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.320]   They don't actually tend to look very far into the horizon.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.660]   They don't have that very focused vergence point
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.960]   that we're talking about that kind of,
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.200]   I guess for lack of a better phrase,
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.460]   that kind of eye of the tiger focus on a goal.
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:26.700]   Rather their eye movements are depleted
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:29.160]   and they're not actually evaluating horizons
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.100]   off in their future.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.060]   They're not focused so much on the extra personal space.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.780]   And this actually can be restored
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.360]   in some of these that took place in Parkinson's patients
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.360]   and other people who have dopamine depleted,
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:43.480]   that when dopamine is restored pharmacologically,
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:46.880]   their visual focus is re-enhanced again.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.700]   Now, there are a lot of details to this study
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.280]   that don't map perfectly onto everything
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.220]   that I've talked about.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.700]   But the point is this,
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:55.920]   when we are focused on a particular point in visual space
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.060]   or a particular goal or horizon,
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.820]   all those systems, our blood pressure, epinephrine,
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.880]   and indeed dopamine get recruited
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.600]   to put us into a state of readiness and willingness
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.000]   to go pursue things in that extra personal space.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.200]   When our visual attention is very diffuse,
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.880]   all of that relaxes and we tend to be more comfortable
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.920]   staying in the place that we are in our peripersonal space.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:23.020]   And the effect works in the other direction too.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.780]   When dopamine is increased,
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.820]   our visual attention for particular things
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.300]   out in space increase.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.920]   So the way it works is reciprocal.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.040]   When we use our visual system in a particular way,
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.220]   bring it to a point of focus,
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.240]   it recruits chemical and neural systems
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.080]   in our brain and body
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.820]   that put us into a state of readiness and pursuit.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:45.360]   And when we increase certain chemicals in our brain and body
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.300]   like epinephrine, like dopamine,
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.440]   then we also allow our visual system
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:54.100]   to be in a state of looking out at particular locations
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.260]   in our visual world.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.420]   So the system works in both directions.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.300]   And some people leverage this by using things like caffeine
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:03.020]   or taking things like L-tyrosine to increase dopamine.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.500]   And again, it works both ways.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.380]   There's no right or wrong way to do it.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:09.580]   I'm a particular fan of using behavioral tools
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:12.900]   always prior to using supplementation
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.380]   or any kinds of other tools
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.900]   because behavioral tools have a very unique feature
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:20.260]   that supplementation and other chemical tools don't,
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:23.260]   which is that behavioral tools used over time
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.040]   engage neuroplasticity.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.580]   As we start to practice using our visual system
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.660]   to harness our attention to particular locations
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:31.920]   and in that way move toward particular goals,
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.120]   we get better and better at using those systems.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.860]   In fact, the systems for focus and motivation
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.140]   themselves have plasticity.
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.940]   So we get better at being motivated and focused
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.380]   when we place our visual attention at a given location.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.100]   Using chemical assistance of a safe kind,
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.220]   of course, check with your doctor,
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:50.800]   but things like L-tyrosine or caffeine or those combined,
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.300]   yes, it will increase dopamine
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.820]   and will increase our ability
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:55.980]   to engage in visual focus somewhat.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.460]   But those compounds alone don't modify the circuitry
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.500]   in the way that we want.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.820]   So I always say behavioral tools first,
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:05.060]   then nutritional tools, then supplementation tools,
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.940]   and then if it's right for you and safe,
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.340]   maybe you advance into some of the other
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.940]   more sophisticated tools.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.380]   I'd like to just briefly recap
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.020]   what I've covered up until now.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.980]   And again, emphasize that much of what I've covered
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.380]   has been based on the beautiful work
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.220]   of Emily Balcetas and colleagues.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:21.360]   I do hope to get her as a guest on the podcast, by the way.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.500]   First of all, set goals that are challenging but possible.
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:27.780]   Those moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult,
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.720]   but moderately challenging goals
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.060]   seem to be the most effective in moving people
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.700]   towards their goals over the short and long-term.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.820]   Second, plan concretely.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.080]   You need a concrete set of actions that you're going to follow
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.820]   in order to reach your goals.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:44.180]   Third, foreshadow failure.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:46.580]   This is a somewhat surprising one to me.
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:49.380]   I would have anticipated that imagining success
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.780]   is the way to go.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.960]   It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.380]   can be useful at the outset of a goal
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:59.580]   and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal,
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.140]   but that it's not terrific for putting you
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.100]   in constant pursuit of that goal.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.840]   Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.100]   and all the terrible things that it's going to bring
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.140]   seems to be more effective and that maps very well
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.640]   to what's known about the neural circuitry
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.440]   and the involvement of the amygdala.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.280]   Focus on particular visual points
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.320]   as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.780]   Removing distractors and getting your body and brain
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:27.200]   into a mode of activation,
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.720]   getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.520]   that puts you into forward motion towards your goals
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.900]   is absolutely key.
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.100]   So that's a brief summary of what I've covered
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.080]   up until now.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.460]   There were other things too, of course,
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:43.340]   the dopamine system and the power of subjective
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.980]   top-down control in regulating that dopamine system.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:49.660]   But I want to be sure to include a tool
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.580]   that's been especially powerful for me,
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:53.820]   that's grounded in the neuroscience research
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.700]   and in the psychology research.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.860]   And as I describe this tool next,
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.840]   I think you'll see the ways in which it meshes nicely
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:04.400]   with the work that Emily Balcetas and colleagues have done.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.900]   This is something that I've personally been doing
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.880]   for many years based on my understanding
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.780]   of the visual system and the understanding that indeed
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.080]   we can move our cognition and our perception
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.920]   from a place of interoception
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.380]   and focusing on our peripersonal space,
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.900]   that space within us and immediately around us
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:27.120]   and on the things that are immediately accessible to us,
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.980]   that we can shift from that mode to this mode
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:33.500]   of exteroception of focusing on things outside the confines
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.060]   of our skin and that are beyond our reach,
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.180]   that are literally goal-directed behaviors
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.100]   and goal-directed thoughts.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.060]   And this is something that in the past
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.860]   I've talked about a little bit,
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.040]   and I've talked about something called space-time bridging.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.340]   And we haven't talked too much about the time domain
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.180]   of the visual system today,
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:53.440]   but space-time bridging is simply a way
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.880]   of using one's visual system to focus
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.580]   on the peripersonal space and interoception,
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.700]   and then gradually in a deliberate way,
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:04.100]   stepping one's focus into the extra personal space
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.160]   and then back to the peripersonal space
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.540]   in a way that gives you a lot of flexibility
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:13.220]   and control over that ability in your daily life.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:15.580]   So I'm going to first describe the tool,
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.380]   and then I will explain more about the underlying science
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:19.820]   and the underlying mechanism.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:22.300]   Here's how you would do this.
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:25.660]   You could do this indoors or outdoors,
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.380]   although ideally you would do it in a location
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.580]   where you could view a horizon.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.540]   It could be through a window
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:33.140]   or ideally outdoors without a window.
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.340]   Could be done any time of day.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.140]   At night, it might be a little more challenging,
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.500]   but it goes the following way.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:41.780]   What you first do is you would close your eyes.
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.140]   This could be done seated or standing,
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:45.860]   but you would close your eyes and you would focus
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:50.500]   as much of your attention, including your visual attention,
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.980]   on your inner landscape, on your interoception.
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.820]   So that would be your breathing, your heart rate,
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.220]   maybe even the surface of your skin,
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.980]   but really focusing internally.
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:00.120]   Now, how can you focus your visual attention internally
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.260]   if your eyes are closed?
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:04.900]   Well, you do that by imagining your inner landscape, okay?
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.860]   So you don't have to imagine your heart beating and so forth,
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:08.900]   but what you're trying to do is eliminate perception
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.180]   of the outside world.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:11.780]   You're eliminating exteroception,
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:14.860]   and you're focusing all of your cognitive attention
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:17.340]   and your perceptual attention on what you're experiencing
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.660]   within the confines of your skin
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:21.980]   or at the level of the surface of your skin
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:23.140]   and inside your body.
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.860]   And you would do that for a duration
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.300]   of approximately three slow breaths, okay?
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:32.340]   So close your eyes, you would do breath one,
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.440]   breath two, and breath three,
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:37.300]   concentrating all your attention on your internal landscape.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.480]   Then you would open your eyes
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.120]   and you would focus your visual attention
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.420]   on some area on the surface of your body.
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.900]   So for me, the way that I typically do this
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.380]   will be to focus on, say, the palm of my hand.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.540]   So I'll focus my visual attention on the palm of my hand.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.920]   And I then do three breaths again,
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.100]   focusing on my internal state,
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.180]   but now I'm splitting out a little bit of my attention
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:00.220]   from interoception to exteroception.
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:01.940]   I'm focusing on something outside me.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:05.580]   The ratio or the split of attention is about 90/10.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:08.380]   About 90% of my attention is focused internally,
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:12.580]   but I'm also focusing some of my attention externally.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:14.540]   Most people can do this pretty easily.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.020]   Then there's a third, what I call station.
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:20.640]   I now move my visual attention to outside my body,
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.220]   to some location in the room,
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:24.020]   or if I'm outside in the external environment,
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.780]   something in the range of five to 15 feet away.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:29.940]   And I'm trying to move 90% of my attention
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.160]   to that external object.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:34.060]   So now I'm really biasing my perception and my attention
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:35.800]   towards exteroception.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.780]   As I breathe, I'm paying attention to those three breaths.
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.160]   So that's why there's still 10%
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.000]   that's focused on my internal landscape,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.060]   because I want to pay attention to those three breaths,
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:49.140]   but I'm focusing as much of my attention outside of myself,
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.700]   maintaining just a little bit on my internal state
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:55.140]   so I can measure the cadence of those three breaths.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:58.020]   Then I move my visual attention to yet another station,
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:43:58.860]   which is further away,
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.940]   typically a horizon or something as far off in the distance
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.340]   as I can possibly see,
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.700]   again, for the duration of three breaths.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:10.500]   And at that point, I'm trying my very best to move 99,
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:14.420]   if not 100% of my attention to that external location.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:20.760]   And then what I typically will do is I will try and expand
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:25.120]   both my vision and my cognition to a much broader sphere.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.580]   This is that magnocellular vision
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.060]   that we talked about before,
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.060]   where I'm not focusing on a particular location
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:30.900]   on the horizon.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.000]   I'm trying to dilate the aperture of my field of view
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.380]   so I can see as much of the visual landscape
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:36.740]   as I'm in as possible.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:41.200]   If you're in an internal, excuse me, if you're in indoors,
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.420]   then that might be the ceiling, the walls,
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:45.040]   and the floor of the environment you're in.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:45.880]   If you're outdoors,
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.720]   it would be to expand your visual focus
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.020]   as broadly as you possibly can,
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.300]   again, for the duration of three breaths.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.860]   Then I would return immediately to my internal landscape.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:59.760]   I would close my eyes and I would do three more breaths,
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.080]   focusing entirely on my interoception,
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:05.100]   on my internal landscape,
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:07.940]   what we called before my peripersonal space.
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.680]   And I would then repeat that.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.800]   Peripersonal space, 100%.
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:15.480]   Focused on my hand, 90%,
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.740]   10% on my peripersonal space or my internal landscape.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.460]   Stepping out to another location
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:23.660]   where it's mostly exteroception, maybe a little bit
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.580]   of recognition of my internal state.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.540]   Then to the horizon, then to this broader visual sphere,
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:29.620]   then back into my body.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.860]   And I would work through each of those stations
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:33.160]   maybe two or three times.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.580]   The entire thing takes about 90 seconds to three minutes,
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.580]   depending on how many breaths you do.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:40.980]   I said three, but you could do one or 10,
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.480]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.060]   Or it's also going to depend on, for instance,
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.420]   how slowly you're breathing,
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.060]   'cause your breathing might be faster than mine
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.420]   or vice versa.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.140]   What is all of this doing?
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.260]   Why do I call this space time bridging?
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:56.560]   And why is this useful for goal setting?
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.680]   The reason I call it space time bridging
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.080]   is that the visual system is not just about analyzing space,
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.300]   it's actually how we batch time.
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:06.820]   It's how we carve up time.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.260]   And the simple way to state this
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:10.460]   is that when we focus our visual attention
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.600]   on a very narrow point,
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:16.400]   that's close to our body and our immediate experience,
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:19.200]   we tend to slice up time very finely.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.840]   We're focused on our breathing.
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.800]   We're focused on our heartbeats.
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.020]   In fact, our breathing and our internal landscape
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.560]   and our heartbeats become the sort of second hand,
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.460]   if you will, on our experience.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.780]   We are carving up time
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:34.260]   according to our immediate physiological experience.
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.960]   Whereas when we focus our visual attention outside our body,
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.220]   not only do we engage
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:42.100]   that exteroceptive extrapersonal space system,
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:43.900]   and we start to engage the dopamine system,
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.780]   the goal-directed system,
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:49.280]   but we also start batching time differently.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.900]   When we focus our visual system
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.680]   into a broader sphere of space
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.480]   or into a space beyond the confines of our skin,
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.220]   we start carving up time, our frame rate changes.
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:02.480]   Now, this is useful in the context of goal setting,
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.180]   goal assessment, and goal pursuit,
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:09.180]   because with the exception of a very few isolated examples,
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:13.900]   almost all goals involve setting some goal
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.580]   that's off in the future,
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:17.940]   and then carving up the time between now
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:21.220]   and the achievement of that goal into milestones
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.160]   that range in duration.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.620]   And the rewards,
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:26.660]   even if we try and just make them every week,
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:29.720]   are going to come at some unexpected intervals.
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.200]   And that's actually can be helpful for reinforcing behavior.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.420]   Intermittent reward that's intermittent and random
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.860]   is the most effective reward schedule we know.
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.620]   But the problem is always
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:43.900]   how do we keep our cognition in line with the long-term goal
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.420]   while also being focused on these more immediate goals?
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.900]   And so this particular practice
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.160]   that I call space-time bridging,
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.560]   but we could give it a different name.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.560]   I'm sure there are better names.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.580]   Maybe you can suggest some in the comment section on YouTube
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:57.340]   that are more accurate or more mapped to it better.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:00.300]   But this behavior or this practice, rather,
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.760]   is teaching us to use our visual system
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.660]   and thereby our cognitive system
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:07.220]   and thereby our reward systems
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:09.860]   to orient to different locations in space
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.860]   and therefore at different locations in time.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:16.260]   And that is the essence of goal-directed behavior.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.500]   That is the essence of setting a goal.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.480]   It's about thinking about what you want.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:23.380]   Then it's about setting milestones
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.700]   that are intermediate to that goal.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:26.980]   Then it's about assessing
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:28.820]   whether or not you're reaching those milestones.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.220]   And then it's, of course, about updating your goals
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:32.980]   if you need to update your goals.
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:37.020]   All of that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:38.660]   if you think about it all at once.
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.780]   But if you break it down into these elements
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:43.100]   that the visual system can help you find
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.600]   and move towards those milestones,
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.540]   I think there's ample evidence to support that,
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.140]   and that your control over your visual system
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:50.100]   is indeed yours,
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:52.380]   that you can deliberately set it to different locations,
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.500]   and then you make a practice
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:57.380]   of stepping through these different stations
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.340]   on a regular basis.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:59.700]   Again, I do this each morning.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:00.960]   I do this once a day.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.540]   Rarely have I done it twice a day.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:04.940]   Rarely have I missed a day.
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.460]   But by doing that, you can be very effective
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.900]   in teaching the systems of your brain
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.840]   that are related to goal setting and reward
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.860]   to map to different timeframes.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.900]   So I found this to be a very effective protocol.
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:21.700]   The Balsettis work has mainly focused on visual tools
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.520]   that are of a single horizon.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.920]   Here I'm talking about multiple,
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:27.140]   what I called stations or horizons.
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:30.340]   But what's very clear is that an ability to move
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.300]   from different visual stations,
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.380]   and to do that in a deliberate way,
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:36.700]   in a focused and conscious way,
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:40.260]   clearly maps to an ability to conceive of different goals
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.820]   over different periods of time.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:44.280]   And I do believe can be greatly beneficial
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.100]   in allowing one to set particular goals
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:49.380]   and then move through the milestones to those goals,
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.380]   and to constantly update one's pursuit and reward
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:53.660]   in reaching those milestones,
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.900]   and eventually the overall goal.
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:58.020]   Per usual, I covered a lot of material today.
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:01.380]   We talked about some of the neuroscience and psychology
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:05.380]   and popular understanding of goal-seeking behavior,
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:07.340]   how to assess goals, et cetera.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:09.300]   Talked about the beautiful work of Emily Balsettis
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.300]   at New York University,
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:14.620]   and her work on the use of the visual system
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.620]   to better achieve goals.
[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:19.340]   And indeed, things like visualization
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:21.540]   and why forecasting failure can be more effective
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:23.100]   than forecasting success.
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.340]   As counterintuitive as that might seem,
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.900]   that's what the data point to.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.780]   And we talked about the importance of setting concrete plans
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:31.380]   and really what that means,
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:34.860]   and what intervals at which to assess progress.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.540]   And what intervals at which to assess reward
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:39.580]   and how the dopamine system is involved.
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.660]   And in addition, I described this practice
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:45.620]   that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:46.940]   of so-called space-time bridging,
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.340]   of using the visual system and your ability
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.780]   to deliberately step your visual system
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:54.300]   from stations that are within your body,
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:57.100]   so-called peripersonal or interoceptive space,
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:58.640]   out into the world further and further,
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.420]   and then back again in sequence
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.940]   as a way to harness and cultivate
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:06.400]   and build up these systems that link vision,
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:09.820]   space, time, reward systems, and so forth.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:13.420]   Ultimately, as you set out to accomplish your goals,
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:15.640]   there are going to be a number of basic steps
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:16.880]   that everyone will have to follow.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.300]   You have to clearly identify
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.660]   what the long-arching ultimate goal is.
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:23.900]   You have to identify what the milestones will be.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.480]   You might not know all of them at the outset,
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:27.700]   but you ought to have some idea about the intervals
[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:30.980]   at which you are going to set those milestones
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:35.100]   and set your reward schedule for assessing progress
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.980]   in route to those milestones and your ultimate goal.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.540]   My hope is that you'll be able to incorporate these tools,
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.100]   if not all of them, perhaps just one of them or two of them,
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.200]   in pursuit of whatever particular goals
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:49.880]   you happen to be focused on at this point and in the future.

[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.760]   That's perhaps the best way to support this podcast.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.800]   And in addition, we have a Patreon.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.400]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.700]   and there you can support the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:28.260]   at any level that you like.
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:30.100]   In today's episode and in previous episodes
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.700]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talked about supplements.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:34.780]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:36.900]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:39.420]   for things like sleep and focus and so forth.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.500]   It's really important that if you're going
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:41.500]   to take supplements,
[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.880]   that they be of the absolute highest quality.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.520]   For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-I-N-E,
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.780]   because Thorne supplements have the highest levels
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.200]   of stringency with respect to the ingredients they include
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.380]   and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.120]   they include in their products.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:56.880]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:01.880]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.480]   and you can see the supplements that I take
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.760]   and get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:08.040]   And if you navigate further into the Thorne site
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.980]   through thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:13.640]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:14.800]   that Thorne makes.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.560]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:19.160]   on Instagram and or Twitter, please do so.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:22.040]   There, I teach neuroscience and neuroscience-related tools
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.360]   that sometimes overlap with the content of the podcast,
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:27.480]   but oftentimes is unique from the content of the podcast.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.120]   Also, if you haven't already done so,
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.920]   please subscribe to the Huberman Lab
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:32.640]   neural network newsletter.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.060]   The neural network newsletter
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:36.800]   is a monthly zero-cost newsletter
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:40.360]   where I very succinctly spell out or list out protocols
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.200]   for things like sleep, learning, neuroplasticity,
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:44.860]   and other topics as well.
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.540]   You can go to hubermanlab.com, click on the menu,
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:48.560]   go to newsletter.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.320]   It's a simple signup.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:52.800]   We will not give out your email information to anybody.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.280]   All our privacy policy is there.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:56.660]   Again, at zero cost, and the tools that are there
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.800]   very cleanly spell out a number of the protocols
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.820]   that you can hear about on the podcast.
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:03.280]   And in closing, I want to thank you once again
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.480]   for joining me in this discussion
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:08.200]   about the biology, science, and in particular,
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:11.440]   the neuroscience of goal setting, goal assessment,
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.220]   and achieving goals.
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:15.780]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:17.640]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.220]   [upbeat music]
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.800]   (upbeat music)
