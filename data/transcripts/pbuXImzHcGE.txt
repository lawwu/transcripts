[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.840]   - Well, I pray your Easter Sunday was a magnificent one.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.520]   Today, we have an email from Candice
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.320]   who lives in Long Beach, California,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.480]   who asks, "Pastor John, what does the Bible say
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.200]   "or what are your thoughts about the practice
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.460]   "of using the Bible to swear truthfulness
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.800]   "in a court of law?
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.740]   "Why is this done, should it be?
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.060]   "And what about those who lie?
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.440]   "Is this act, using a Bible,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.480]   "making a lie more punishable in God's eyes?"
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.980]   - Well, let me be honest right up front.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.300]   I think Christians should resist
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.020]   taking such oaths in that traditional way.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.680]   And by that traditional way, I mean,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.340]   and this is part of my answer to her question
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.520]   about the meaning of it,
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.800]   taking a sacred object
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.980]   and swearing to tell the truth
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.260]   by that sacred object,
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.680]   like a Bible or your mother's name
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.880]   or your father's grave
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.420]   or the name of God or Christ.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.920]   Like, "I swear by my father's grave,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.800]   "I won't lie to you," something like that.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.080]   In this traditional way of taking an oath,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.300]   by calling some sacred object to mind,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.300]   the idea is that your commitment to truth
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.320]   may be weak and would be strengthened
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.920]   by the desire not to desecrate
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.540]   the sacred object you have sworn by.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540]   You see that?
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.200]   In other words, the assumption is
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.960]   you come into this courtroom or some situation
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.160]   and you're not really committed to tell the truth.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.840]   And maybe we could up your commitment to tell the truth
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.720]   if we could get you to associate
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.800]   your telling of the truth or your lying
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   with the desecration of some sacred object
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.180]   like your mother's name or your dad's grave
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.400]   or the name of God or the Bible.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.260]   So that's why I think the Bible
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.220]   was traditionally used in court
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.140]   because it was, once upon a time,
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.140]   a universally held treasure of holiness in the culture
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.980]   that no one but the most hardened person
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.980]   would want to desecrate by swearing by it
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.820]   and then lying through his teeth
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.000]   right after he had put his hand on the Bible
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   that he's now desecrating.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.640]   And the reason I want to discourage Christians
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.460]   from taking that kind of oath
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.640]   is because here's what Jesus said in Matthew 5:33.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.220]   "Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old,
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.180]   "You shall not swear falsely,
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.960]   "but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.240]   "But I say to you, do not take an oath at all,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   "either by heaven, for that is God's throne,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.540]   "or by the earth, for it is his footstool,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.860]   "or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.660]   "And do not take an oath by your head,
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.180]   "for you cannot make one hair white or black.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.180]   "Let what you say be simply yes or no.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.860]   "Anything more than this comes from evil."
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.260]   And then James picks it up, James 5, 12.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.620]   "Above all, my brothers," which is quite a statement,
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.620]   "do not swear either by heaven or earth or any other oath.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.960]   "Let your yes be yes and your no be no,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.880]   "so that you may not fall under condemnation."
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.980]   Now, as soon as those verses are quoted like that,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.320]   usually it is pointed out from the other side,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.920]   whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.060]   God himself took an oath in Hebrews 6, 13.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.160]   And angels take oaths, Revelation 10, 6.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.960]   And Paul, at least five times,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.400]   heightened his seriousness in telling this truth
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.840]   by saying he was speaking in the presence of God
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.520]   or of Christ.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.940]   Now, my response to that is to say,
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.400]   well, yes, that's important to take into consideration,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.760]   but none of those examples, as far as I can tell,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.560]   diminishes the seriousness or applicability
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   of Jesus' words in Matthew 5 or James in 5, 12.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   The burden of Jesus is that his people be so utterly
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.400]   and deeply and simply committed to tell the truth
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   that they don't need buttresses to hold up their words
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.080]   like the fear of desecrating a sacred object, whatever.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   In fact, he says, Jesus says that if you add to yes or no,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   it is likely that this is coming from evil.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   So, very practically, here's what I have thought I would do.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.880]   I've never been a witness in a courtroom, not yet,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.920]   but here's what I thought I would do
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   if I ever was deposed by lawyers or sworn in, as they say,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.240]   in a courtroom as a witness.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.800]   So, they present me with a Bible, maybe, hold out.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.360]   I don't know how the different courts
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.540]   are doing it these days.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.000]   If they presented me with a Bible
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.200]   and asked me to put my hand on it
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.960]   and nothing but the truth, I would say something like,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.360]   Your Honor, my commitment to the truth
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.600]   and to the Lord of the truth, Jesus Christ,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.680]   leads me to believe that it would dishonor
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.600]   both my commitment to the Lord and the Lord himself
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.240]   if I needed to put my hand on this sacred book
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.380]   to guarantee my truthfulness.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.720]   I am totally committed to the truth
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.640]   and to the Lord of the truth.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.360]   So, I ask that I be permitted to act without such an oath,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.240]   but I do promise, I do promise,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.820]   in reliance on the help of the Lord Jesus
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.640]   to tell the truth, the whole truth,
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.560]   and nothing but the truth.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   And I think that courts would honor that promise.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.200]   I think they would allow you to say it your way.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.320]   And it's an occasion for testimony.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.920]   And I'd use it if the Lord gave me grace.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.640]   So, the point of that little action right there
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   in the courtroom is to magnify Jesus as the Lord of truth
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.680]   and to highlight my commitment to be a person of the truth
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.580]   without any need for threats that my dishonesty
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.580]   would bring worse consequences
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.640]   because I put my hand on the Bible.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.440]   Fascinating, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.400]   And thank you, Candice, for the question.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.760]   These are the tricky pastoral questions
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.120]   we address on the podcast each week.

[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.400]   And one of the most common questions
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   that we get over and over again
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.680]   is about how faith and works work together
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.880]   in the Christian life, and we'll address that tomorrow.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
