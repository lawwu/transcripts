[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   I've interviewed thousands of people, I think,
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.960]   over my career for all the companies that I've been involved in,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.360]   whether it's been building Facebook or investing in companies like Slack or Grok.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.080]   There's one question that I always go to that I think is
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.440]   the most predictive of your ability to contribute in a company.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.200]   I say, take a few minutes to think about something that you are an absolute expert in,
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.480]   and it does not matter what it is.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840]   It could be how to play the French horn because you're a musician.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.360]   It could be how to play poker or how to play chess, and then explain it to me.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.560]   What I'm trying to figure out in those few minutes is,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.000]   do you have a very clear mind?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.640]   Can you simplify the complex and abstract,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.520]   and then can you communicate that to me?
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.240]   That's a huge filter in the people that are like coached and trained and
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.800]   robotic versus the people that can really think on their feet.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.400]   What you're testing is their mastery and their ability to communicate,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.040]   and their ability to simplify complex things that you
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.040]   can use to get somebody else on the same page with you.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.360]   That's a very powerful skill inside of a company.
