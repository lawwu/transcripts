[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.740]   When you're lost in the wild and you're scared as a child
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.600]   and death looks you bang in the eye,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400]   and you're sore as a boil,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   it's according to Hoyle to cock your revolver and die.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.220]   But the code of a man says, "Fight all you can,"
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.880]   and self-dissolution is barred.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.560]   In hunger and woe, it's easy to blow.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's the hell served for breakfast that's hard.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   You're sick of the game.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.660]   Well, now, that's a shame.
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.400]   You're young and you're brave and you're bright.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.140]   You've had a raw deal.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.940]   I know, but don't squeal.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.740]   Buck up, do your damnedest, and fight.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580]   It's the plugging away that will win you the day.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.820]   So don't be a piker, old pard.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.720]   Just draw on your grit.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   It's so easy to quit.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.060]   It's the keeping your chin up that's hard.
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.620]   That's hard.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.400]   It's easy to cry that you're beaten and die.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.660]   It's easy to crawfish and crawl,
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.500]   but to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight,
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.940]   why, that's the best game of them all.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.040]   And though you come out of each grueling bout,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.980]   all broken and beaten and scarred,
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.780]   just have one more try.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.940]   It's dead easy to die.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.440]   It's the keeping on living that's hard.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.520]   When you get what you want and you struggle for self
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.060]   and the world makes you king for a day,
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.120]   just go to the mirror and look at yourself
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.100]   and see what that man has to say.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940]   For it isn't your father or mother or wife
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.300]   whose judgment upon you must pass,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.760]   the fellow whose verdict counts the most in your life
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.340]   is the one staring back from the glass.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.280]   Some people may think you a straight shooting chum
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.040]   and call you a wonderful guy,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.520]   but the guy in the glass says you're only a bum
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   if you can't look him straight in the eye.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.160]   He's the fellow to please, nevermind all the rest,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.960]   for he's with you clear up to the end,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.560]   and you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.500]   if the man in the glass is your friend.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.300]   You may fool the whole world down the pathway of life
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.300]   and get pats on the back as you pass,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.040]   but your final reward will be heartaches and tears
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.120]   if you've cheated the man in the glass.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.280]   'Twas battered and scarred,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.960]   and the auctioneer thought it scarcely worth his while
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.820]   to waste much time on the old violin,
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.820]   but he held it up with a smile.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.260]   "What am I bidding, good folks?" he cried.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.140]   "Who'll start the bidding for me?
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.500]   "A dollar, a dollar, then two, only two,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.260]   "two dollars, and who'll make it three?
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.000]   "Three dollars once, three dollars twice,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.780]   "going for three, but no."
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.680]   From the room far back, a gray-haired man
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.180]   came forward and picked up the bow.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.880]   Then, wiping the dust from the old violin
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.020]   and tightening the loosened strings,
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.540]   he played a melody pure and sweet
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.400]   as a caroling angel sings.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.180]   The music ceased, and the auctioneer,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.600]   with a voice that was quiet and low, said,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.180]   "What am I bid for the old violin?"
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.260]   And he held it up with the bow.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.760]   "A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.140]   "Two thousand, and who'll make it three?
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.220]   "Three thousand once, three thousand twice,
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.160]   "and going and gone," said he.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.000]   The people cheered, but some of them cried.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.560]   "We do not quite understand.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.280]   "What change it's worth?"
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   Swift came the reply.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.000]   "The touch of the master's hand."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.680]   And many a man with life out of tune
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.320]   and battered and scarred with sin
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.960]   is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.400]   much like the old violin.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.880]   A mess of pottage, a glass of wine,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.120]   a game, and he travels on.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.120]   He is going once and going twice.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.600]   He's going and almost gone.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.200]   But the master comes, and the foolish crowd
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   never can quite understand the worth of a soul
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.960]   and the change that is wrought
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.820]   by the touch of the master's hand.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.520]   The holidays start here at Ralph's
