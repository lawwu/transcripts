[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   I'm a big believer in people, everybody getting ideally two or three resistance training sessions
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.500]   in per week and two, maybe three cardiovascular training sessions per week. That would be
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.820]   ideal. I'm very frankly delighted that nowadays there's such a push for women and men to resistance
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.940]   train. That wasn't the case when I was growing up. I recall taking my sister to the gym for
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.140]   the first time. I think she was the only woman in the gym when we were in high school. We've been
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.840]   talking about training, but we haven't really spelled out what you would suggest a novice,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.340]   perhaps an intermediate resistance training, cardiovascular training program would look
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.840]   like in broad terms. I realize we don't have time here to get into all the nitty-gritty details.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.340]   You've written about this elsewhere and we'll refer people to those terrific resources in the show
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.880]   note captions, but what would you like to see women doing? Maybe we can break up the age brackets
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.320]   because it sounds like this is something that is resurfacing again and again here. Women, let's say
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.880]   30 and younger, women 31 to let's say 40, and then let's say 41 to 60, and then maybe 61 and on.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.780]   In terms of how many sessions of resistance training per week, is it whole body training,
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.820]   how many sessions of cardiovascular training, and what sorts of examples could you give?
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.940]   Yeah. If we're looking at that 20 to 30-year-old, a lot of times I really try to get them to focus on
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.500]   the whole movement aspect first. We phase them in. Same with older women. Phase them in, learn how to move,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.960]   learn complex movements, so that when you are going in to do resistance training, preferably three to four
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.220]   times a week, you can look at moving well, and it doesn't have to be a long period of time. If you're doing
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.980]   to failure, which works really well when you're younger, to increase strength and a little bit of hypertrophy,
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.880]   you're going to have to spend a little bit more time in the gym, so it might be 45 to 60 minutes.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.380]   When we're looking at doing that four times a week, you can add in a sprint interval training at the end
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.380]   of one of those to get that super high intensity, or you can look at putting in, at the most, two hit
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.140]   sessions on separate days. If you're training specifically for something, so if I work with a
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.520]   lot of endurance athletes still, and they're like, well, how do I fit it in? It's like, okay, well,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.820]   we look at the quality and how that fits into your training. So if you're training for a marathon,
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.220]   you're training for a triathlon, or other endurance stuff, you can take that high intensity work and put
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.260]   it into your training program. So ideally, we look at three to four resistance training with really good
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.600]   movement when we're in the younger set with two high intensities. When we start getting into our 30s,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.720]   we start having an eye to how are we actually doing that resistance training. Instead of just going and
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.660]   doing a circuit, we're really focusing on let's do some compound movements. Let's look at doing some
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.800]   heavier work. Let's look at how we are periodizing. So we're having, you know, six week blocks and we're
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.240]   building on those blocks because we want that base foundation. So when we get to be 40 plus, we can
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.780]   actually go and do our power-based training. If you're in your 40s, you've never done resistance
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.380]   training at all, then we take between two weeks to four months to really learn how to move well,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.980]   because there's a higher incidence of soft tissue injury and overall injury as we get into our 40s
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.300]   because of perturbations of estrogen. And ideally, when we get there, we're looking at that around three,
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.220]   minimum three resistance training with compound movements and either one sprint interval or two sprint
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.660]   intervals and one hit in a week.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.040]   And just to remind people, compound movements, multi-joint movements, squats, deadlifts, chin-ups, rows,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.400]   overhead presses, bench presses, et cetera, as opposed to isolation movements where only one joint is moving.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:16.020]   Yeah. And for everybody in all those age ranges that you describe, are you suggesting they train
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.840]   the same muscle groups three or four times per week, or they do some sort of split where it's upper body,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.000]   lower body, take a day off, or upper body, take a day off, lower body, take a day off, whatever,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.400]   what might work for them?
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.640]   Yeah. What works for them? If you're looking for short amount of time in the gym because of busy lives,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.160]   then you can split it. If you're looking at, okay, well, I can allocate an hour to an hour and a half
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.680]   in the gym, then you can do total body with adequate rest. The key when you're younger is working to failure.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.260]   The key when you're older is working heavy. Interesting.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.740]   Yeah. So when we're looking at working to failure, we're trying to get more of that lean mass growth
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.900]   with strength. When we get older, because it's so difficult to put on lean mass, we really want to
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.360]   focus on the strength component because that becomes more important when we're talking about longevity.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.840]   Because if you're looking at the strength component from a central nervous system standpoint,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.300]   we see it feeds forward into better proprioception, attenuation of cognitive decline.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.480]   And this is the other thing that you in neurosciences would understand, the sex differences in things like
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.440]   dementia and Alzheimer's. There's some really interesting research looking at strength training
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.100]   and that power-based stuff when we're getting into our older ages because we get more neural growth patterns
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.460]   and more neural pathways.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.880]   Even some interesting literature about emphasizing some unilateral movements as people get older,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.260]   not just dual limb movements or dual limb simultaneous movements. You always want to
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.080]   train both sides of your body, folks. But so if I understand correctly, younger women should
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.160]   train to failure, try and generate strength and hypertrophy. As women get older, they should
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.180]   emphasize more strength training, leave some repetitions in reserve, but train heavier.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:12.120]   It makes so much sense what you're saying. Because what we know about the nervous system as we age is that
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.060]   there's some atrophy or at least some weakening of neuromuscular connections and the upper motor neurons
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.300]   in the brain that control the neuromuscular connections in the spinal cord out to the muscle.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.840]   There's something really sticky about this idea in terms of longevity that I don't think anyone else has ever said.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:37.460]   No, the thing about it is men age more in a linear fashion, whereas women, we have a definitive point
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.360]   in our late 40s, early 50s, where all of a sudden things go to shit, where it's that perimenopausal state.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.220]   And I can't tell you how many emails and DMs I get in a day from women who are like,
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.780]   I'm 46 or I'm 47.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.700]   I'm putting on body fat. I don't know what's going on.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.540]   I can't sleep.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.380]   And then we say, it's perimenopause.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.340]   They're like, what is that?
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:05.640]   And so when we're looking at perimenopause, it is a huge change in the body because you're having
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.060]   less and less of your sex hormones circulating.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.200]   More and more anovulatory cycles means no progesterone or very low progesterone.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   You're having a difference in the pulse of your estradiol to those flatline aspects.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.020]   And because every system in the body is affected by it, this is why you see more soft tissue injuries.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.400]   Like two of the biggest things that women who are in their 40s are going to PTs about are frozen shoulder
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.220]   and plantar fascia.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.980]   These are two really indicative issues that are happening in perimenopause.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:44.240]   So that whole section of mid to mid 40s to early 50s is a definitive aging point where I really
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.960]   tried to get women to get into the heavy lifting and get into the patterns of polarizing their
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.640]   training, not putting an emphasis on zone two, just really looking at how am I polarizing?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.060]   How am I affecting my central nervous system?
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.520]   So that when they get into that one point in time of that perimenopause, their body is already
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.600]   conditioned for the stress that's coming.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   Whereas men, we see that kind of stuff happens in their late 50s, early 60s.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.120]   So the soft tissue injuries, the change in body comp comes at a later time.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.900]   So yes, looking at how we're scoping our strength training, definitely something to think about
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.320]   in a longevity factor.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.700]   But for women, there's a better indication of the timing across the ages of when you should
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.420]   start implementing.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.980]   For men, I think you have a better bandwidth of when you should start implementing.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:41.480]   My observation is that most women sort of, unless they know better, default to cardiovascular
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.540]   exercise as opposed to resistance training.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:52.760]   So if a woman in her 40s, late 30s to let's say 50, is doing two to four sessions of resistance
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.560]   training workouts per week, and they also really like cardio or they feel they want to or should
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.580]   do cardio, should they be careful about how much cardio they're doing?
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.280]   And is there a best form of cardio?
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.100]   Should they really emphasize the high-intensity interval training?
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.380]   Should they avoid zone two?
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.240]   We should probably also define for people what zone two is if they don't already know.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:22.180]   So I am notorious for slamming things like Orange Theory and F45 because they market specifically
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.700]   to that age group of women.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.160]   And it's not appropriate because it's not true high-intensity work.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:34.420]   When we're looking at women who are really trying to maximize body composition change and longevity
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.160]   and unfortunately default to cardio because they think, oh, that's going to help change
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.040]   my body composition.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.460]   It's going to help me lose body fat.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.720]   It doesn't.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.580]   Is this things like soul cycle as well?
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.200]   Okay.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.580]   I've never done any of these.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.740]   But I imagine there's a lot of spinning, a lot of moving, a lot of sweating, and a lot
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.900]   of, quote unquote, calories burned emphasis.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.200]   Yes, there is.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.760]   But it puts women squarely in moderate intensity where they're so used to leaving one of those
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.780]   classes feeling absolutely smashed that when you tell them, actually, that training doesn't
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.740]   work for you because it's putting you in a state of intensity that drives cortisol up.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.460]   But it's not a strong enough stress to invoke the post-exercise growth hormone and testosterone
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.640]   responses that we want to dampen that cortisol.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.960]   So this is why we have that hyperbole of women who are in their 40s plus shouldn't do high-intensity
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.360]   work.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.640]   It's like, well, actually, they shouldn't do moderate intensity.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.040]   They need to avoid that.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.580]   Polarizing, absolutely.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.700]   That's what we want.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:39.580]   We want true high-intensity work, which is one to four minutes of 80% or more.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.080]   Or if you're doing sprint interval, it's full gas for 30 seconds or less.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.540]   And you're doing that a couple of times a week.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:52.680]   You're not doing it every day because you need to have enough recovery to hit those intensities
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.740]   truly because those are the intensities that are going to give you those post-exercise hormonal
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.200]   responses to drop cortisol.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.740]   When we're looking at women who are like, oh, well, I love going out for hours and hours on
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.960]   my bike and I love, you know, doing my spin classes, it's like, okay, but we need to look
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.900]   at the big rock here.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:19.180]   If you are looking for longevity and body composition change and cognition and all those things, you
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.960]   have to polarize your training and that has to be the focus.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.440]   But soul food, like I come up with a long background of endurance.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.700]   I now love riding my gravel bike on the weekends for long periods of time, which is not optimal
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:37.980]   for me, my age, that kind of stuff for all the things that I want to see improvements in.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.920]   But mentally, it's great.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.540]   So when we talk about going out for that long stuff, zone two is at low conversation and that's fine
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.720]   for mental health and being out in nature.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.260]   But for optimal health and well-being, we don't want to do that.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:01.920]   We want to look at resistance training as a bedrock and true high-intensity work to help with body
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.020]   composition change, metabolic control, insulin sensitivity, brain health, and dropping that
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.360]   cortisol.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.300]   So you've mentioned polarized training.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.920]   If I understand correctly, this would be a woman doing three or four days of high-intensity
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.660]   resistance training for 45 to 60 or 45 to 75 minutes per session.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:29.560]   And then at the opposite extreme, maybe just walking a lot or jogging a lot.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.840]   So is that what you're talking about, polarized training, as opposed to these other forms
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.340]   of training where it's designed to get people sweating like crazy, breathing hard for long
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.060]   periods of time, but neither putting them in the landscape of inducing muscle strength adaptations
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:51.360]   and hypertrophy adaptations, nor really taxing the cardiovascular system enough to create an
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.960]   increase in longevity, for instance.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.760]   When I talk about polarizing, I look at the high-intensity strength.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.940]   That's really hard on the central nervous system.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.020]   And then we look from a cardiovascular standpoint of doing true high-intensity work.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.240]   So the walking is more of the recovery.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.740]   So if you're going to go out and do something long, it has to be very, very easy.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:19.040]   If you are looking at cardiovascular and you want that big sweat, then we are talking true
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.220]   sprint interval training.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:28.120]   So what I have a lot of women do is a 20-minute lower body heavy set, and then they'll go on
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.660]   the assault bike and do as hard as they can for 30 seconds, and then recover as much as
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.780]   they need to, to go then do another 30 seconds as hard as they can.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.640]   Most people go, oh, I can do four or five of those.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.260]   After two, they're completely gassed because it's that hard of work.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.840]   And that's what I mean by polarizing.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.060]   You have very, very low intensity for recovery and super, super high intensity for metabolic
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.660]   and cardiovascular changes is what we're after.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:03.120]   You have very, very low intensity for recovery and super high intensity for recovery and super high intensity.
