[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880]   show.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.400]   I wasn't able to get in front of the computer last week to do it on Friday, so I'm doing
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.720]   it this morning.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:51.120]   Welcome to a new week.

[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.280]   and the computer and all of that, I record a live Q&A show, works just like live radio
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.480]   call-in show.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   My listeners get a phone number, they call in and we chat.

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   We begin with Mark.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.560]   Mark, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.520]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.480]   I'm calling about my friend.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.240]   He's in the unfortunate position that his wife divorced him.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240]   Your friend, uh-huh, yes.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   Sorry.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200]   I was making a joke and all of a sudden I made the joke over top and it wasn't very
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.600]   funny because you talked about a very serious situation.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.320]   So I hereby retract the joke.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.240]   I'm sorry for interrupting you.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.200]   Oh, no, that's fine.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.400]   That's fine.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.280]   And so they're kind of getting down to the final details of the divorce and they're stuck
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.760]   over what to do with the house.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.200]   She would like to keep it, but they want to divide the equity.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.160]   And so I was wondering if you had advice or suggestions on how to equity strip that so
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.700]   that he can get half the equity of the house, but she could retain ownership.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.600]   Why does she want to keep the house?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   You know, I haven't had that conversation with them.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.240]   I believe she's just comfortable with it and likes it.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.360]   And that's as far as that's my guess.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.440]   I don't know the exact reason.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   Okay.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.600]   Well, there can be good reasons to keep the house.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   So I want to begin.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.300]   I'm not saying, you know, don't do it.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.320]   Some people really love a certain house.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.480]   They really want to have that house.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.800]   It's just, you know, maybe it's the family home.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.380]   Maybe it's a brick, you know, a brick straw roofed family cottage that they've lived in
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.120]   since the 1600s, you know, or something like that.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.320]   But very rarely is that the case.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.220]   Usually a house is just a house.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.540]   Now if we were asking her, do they have children?
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.540]   They do not.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.540]   Okay.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.900]   So another thing is when couples have children, a lot of times they say, "Well, we want to
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900]   keep the children.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.700]   We want to stay in this house for the stability of the children."
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.400]   After all, these are their rooms and we're going through a traumatic experience and these
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.260]   are their rooms in the house or they're in this particular school because of the school
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.240]   district and we want them to stay in that school so their lives are as, you know, maintain
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.880]   as much continuity as possible.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.480]   Those are some reasons that people want to keep a house.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.380]   But in general, I think it's a bad idea to try to keep the house.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.080]   And I'll give you a few reasons why to think about that, to present to them before we try
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.580]   to actually solve the problem.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.480]   The first thing is when keeping the house, it's often financially messy and it's often
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.180]   messy when working through divorce court documents, working through refinancing, etc.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.340]   If they have followed the normal path when couples buy houses, they own the house jointly
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.260]   and they have a jointly held mortgage on the house.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.360]   It's simpler if the house were in her name and she held the mortgage, but that's not
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   the common path.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.220]   The common path is that they own the house jointly and that they have a joint mortgage.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.100]   So a lot of times couples will try to settle this in a divorce decree.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.180]   They'll say, "Okay, well, he's going toâ€”she's going to keep the house, but he's going to
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.180]   move out.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.380]   She's going to get the house in the divorce decree, but she's going to pay the mortgage."
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.820]   The problem is can she actually refinance that?
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.740]   And so, for example, if she's going to stay in the house, but they're going to keep the
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.700]   mortgage as a joint mortgage, that puts him in a tremendously dangerous position because
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.260]   he's legally liable to the mortgage company to pay the mortgage if she doesn't pay.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.780]   No matter what the divorce document says, what matters is the mortgage that he signed.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.220]   And so if I were giving him advice, I would make sure, I would say never ever maintain
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   yourself on the mortgage.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.300]   It's just simply too big of a risk for you to be basically a cosigner on a debt that
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.140]   you're not in charge of anymore.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.340]   And if she gets behind, she gets sick, she becomes unemployed or something like that
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.820]   and she can't make those mortgage payments, it's a tremendous risk for him.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.140]   Now how could that be solved?
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.140]   Well, it could be solved if she bought the house, if she bought him out of the house
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.060]   and she refinanced it.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.220]   Why is that usually difficult?
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.820]   Well, it's usually difficult because most couples buy a house based upon a dual income
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.820]   household.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.300]   Most couples, especially most couples who don't have children, do their financial planning
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.460]   based upon a dual income household.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.080]   And so if those incomes are split apart, the house is probably more than she could comfortably
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.900]   afford on a single income.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.780]   And if there are no children involved, I don't know if they've worked out any kind of alimony
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.620]   payments or not, but usually her income would be lower.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.200]   And it's even worse if it's just a single income because then she has no source of income
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.940]   until she goes out and reestablishes herself in a job and in a career.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.820]   And the house that a couple would buy, especially a couple that's planning for marriage, planning
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.620]   for children, is probably a very different house than an individual single person would
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.620]   buy.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.060]   And so it's probably not a great fit because there were different ideas in mind.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.020]   And then the final component is what about if there's a profit, if there's profit in
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.020]   the house?
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.460]   So it gets complex with the tax planning, for example.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.780]   If they own the house jointly and they sell the house, then if there's a profit on the
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.180]   house, a gain, then they can just split the profit.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.460]   They may qualify for the Section 121 exclusion of capital gains from the sale of a personal
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.460]   residence.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.460]   Are they living in the United States?
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.460]   I didn't ask that.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.180]   They are living in the United States.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.140]   And if this is relevant, when they got the house, she was a paralegal and has now passed
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.140]   the bar.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.780]   And so her income, I believe, would have jumped sufficiently enough that she could sustain
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   the current mortgage payments.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.460]   I don't know all the details, but that would be my guess is that she's at that level where
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.460]   she could sustain it.
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.460]   Perfect.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.460]   So we'll get to that.
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.460]   That is very important because that will make all the difference in the world.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.300]   Let me just finish kind of the general advice and then we'll go to the specific solutions
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.300]   there.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:06.140]   So the tax situation is complex because what do you do?
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.140]   How do we qualify that?
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.100]   If he sells the house to her, does he receive the exclusion on the gain in the property?
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.940]   What do we actually â€“ how do we qualify for this?
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.980]   Now is it possible to do?
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.980]   Yes.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.760]   You can do it.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.540]   You can separate the property.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.180]   But the basic point that I'm driving at is you don't want to continue on in a business
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.620]   relationship after the fact.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.300]   If you look at people who get divorced, divorce stinks all around the world.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.860]   But why does divorce stink?
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.780]   Well, basically it turns into a really bad, nasty business partnership in almost every
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.220]   circumstance, even in the best of divorces where everyone's talking to each other,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.220]   etc.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.980]   Because you've got a financial life gathered together with somebody who was a romantic
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.940]   partner, a life partner and is now a business partner but the business partner has gone
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.380]   wrong or the business partnership has gone wrong.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:06.100]   So unwinding all of that is really hard and the best thing to do is to unwind it as quickly
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.980]   as possible so that you can go on with your life.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.600]   So you want to work towards complete and total financial separation.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.420]   You don't want to continue with, "Okay, I'm going to be on the mortgage for a while,"
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.420]   etc.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.740]   So that's my goal is complete and total financial separation and do it as quickly
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:27.700]   as possible to minimize years of pain, minimize frustration going on.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.140]   Complete and total financial separation.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.780]   That's usually best achieved by simply selling the house.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.900]   And if you sell the house, sell all the property, the only assets you usually don't want to
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.660]   just sell completely are business assets.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.900]   That's harder than a house.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.140]   But houses are a dime a dozen.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.460]   There's a house on every street corner.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.260]   A house is a house is a house basically in almost every circumstance.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.700]   So it's best usually just sell it, split it, pay off all the debts and part ways and not
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.540]   have anything going forward.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:09:03.940]   Now, if on the other hand she has the money and she can put herself in a situation where
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.940]   she can comfortably afford the house, she says, "I want to live in this house.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.260]   This is where I want to live," for her own reasons, then the answer is simple.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.980]   Have her refinance the house, have her get a new mortgage, get him off the mortgage and
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.460]   have him sell or deed his ownership interest to her.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.260]   That's the answer.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.420]   But it just depends on her borrowing capacity if she can do that.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.420]   Okay.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:39.380]   That's good to know.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.980]   In doing that, I assume that turns out technically as a sale.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.780]   Is that correct how that would be treated for tax purposes?
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.500]   Sort of.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:58.100]   So in a divorce settlement, you have some unique tax transfer rules that are available
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.220]   to you.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:11.420]   And so in divorce tax planning, there are three â€“ let's talk about the section 120.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.620]   What I'm assuming you're asking about is how does the 120 â€“ first of all, do they
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.620]   have a gain on the property?
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.620]   Does this matter at all?
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.740]   Do you know if they have a gain?
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.020]   I'm assuming so.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   I'm assuming so.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.020]   They've had the house about six years.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.020]   Okay.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.740]   So if there's a transfer by one spouse to the other of their interest in the home so
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:37.860]   that one spouse owns the whole home and there's a â€“ then in that situation, the acquiring
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.300]   spouse would just pay the other spouse and the spouse that is selling should qualify
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.340]   for the exclusion on capital gains.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.780]   So it's a fairly clear thing.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.540]   Now they can make various changes to it but yeah, that would be the simplest thing.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.740]   Just have her buy him out on his share of the property.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.820]   He'll get the section 121 exclusion on the gain and she can have the property and the
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.860]   debt that goes with it.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.780]   Okay.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.380]   And then he would also qualify then for the 1031 exchange?
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.380]   No.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.020]   You can't do a 1031 exchange on a privately held residence.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.780]   So this is â€“ I'm just talking about the â€“ the 1031 exchange is where you have capital
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.740]   gain property that's business or investment property that you transfer for other business
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.540]   or investment property of a like kind and you avoid triggering capital gains tax on
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.540]   the sale.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.060]   But in this situation, we're talking about the $250,000 exclusion for a single person
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.020]   or $500,000 exclusion for a married couple on the sale of their personal residence that
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.980]   they have lived in for two out of the last five years.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.540]   Got it.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.860]   Got it.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.380]   That makes sense.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.380]   Well, awesome.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.020]   In the divorce, there is â€“ it's called section 1041 of the tax code.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:58.300]   In the divorce, then property transfers between spouses don't generally recognize gains or
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   losses and so they can transfer the property around.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.140]   So back to your equity stripping question, if there's a way that they can sit down
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.860]   and adjust the assets based upon their individual balance sheet, yeah, they can do that.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.060]   The court will generally ignore embedded tax obligations.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.820]   They consider that to be basically hypothetical and so most judges and courts will ignore
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.780]   embedded tax obligations.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.260]   But what they should do is not ignore them.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.900]   They should look at them.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.020]   And I think that the general â€“ again, the general goal is part ways, have everything
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.460]   finished, sell the property, incur the taxes if necessary and just part ways.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.760]   I would â€“ even though it may work out financially and again, she's a smart girl.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.100]   She says, "I want to live in this house."
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   Fine.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.260]   I don't think that's a bad idea even just for her.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.380]   I think it's just a better idea.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.380]   Sell the house, start fresh, especially even if she has a much higher income, start â€“ rent
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.220]   a little condo, rent a little apartment, start fresh.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.860]   Get a clean start, have a clean break, start a new life and make fresh decisions so that
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.900]   that chapter of your life is gone.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.900]   Okay.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   Thank you for that.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.900]   I appreciate it.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.980]   I've got a couple of other questions but I'll go ahead and let you move on and if
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.820]   no one else pops in, would there be time?
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.540]   We've got one other caller on the line right now so go ahead.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.940]   We've got time for you.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.220]   Oh, awesome.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.220]   Okay.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.660]   So like you, I'm looking to invest in real estate and like you, I live overseas.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:30.940]   So I was wondering just what your plan was for finding a deal for closing it, for managing
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.340]   renters from overseas.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.860]   Are you looking family, management companies?
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.860]   Have you built up a team in place?
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.060]   And alongside that, I know margins are tight.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.220]   So if you're paying all those people to manage a property while you're overseas, what
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.100]   are you thinking in terms of margins?
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.940]   I think it depends on the market and I am not â€“ I don't know.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.420]   I have not purchased any property overseas yet.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.340]   I'm still kind of stuck in this back and forth situation of am I going to go back to
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.220]   the United States or am I going to stay outside of the United States and I'm sitting and
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.420]   watching and waiting.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.800]   So I can't answer from personal experience because I haven't developed a large property
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.260]   portfolio outside of the United States.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.460]   I have some plans.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:21.380]   I have some specific markets that I'm looking at but I can't speak from a place of experience.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:27.460]   That said, I think the answer is as with any real estate option is move slowly and contact
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.300]   local experts and get local expertise.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.820]   The most important â€“ in my opinion, one of the very important differences between
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.500]   working in the United States and working in some other markets is going to be access to
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.780]   local resources, local people.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.140]   One of the great benefits of investing in the United States is you have a largely commoditized
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.140]   market.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.180]   For example, you have the MLS that every real estate agent has access to.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.780]   There's a very commoditized market.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:00.740]   The marketplace in the United States works well from hands off or arm's length transactions.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.820]   You don't have to get involved and know somebody.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.140]   But in other markets around the world, that is very different where you have to get involved
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.140]   and know somebody.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:13.980]   Now, there's a big difference between Cambodia and Portugal.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:19.340]   There's a big difference between Panama and Kuala Lumpur.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:26.180]   There's a big difference between buying a Singapore apartment versus buying teak land
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.100]   in Nicaragua or something like that.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.380]   So every investment is going to come with its unique things.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.700]   But I think number one, you need local people because some markets, especially some of the
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.980]   more profitable markets, you need insiders.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.940]   You need inside people in the market.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.580]   Number two, I think you need to be really careful and thoughtful about being slow to
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.580]   get into it.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.660]   The thing that bothers me most about a lot of overseas investments is that many markets
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.260]   are much less liquid.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.780]   So in the United States, what we're accustomed to in the real estate market, we're accustomed
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.540]   to a very liquid market.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.140]   You can go into a deal and you can know, "All right, if I put the property on the market
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:09.460]   at this price, then it'll sell in one week at this price.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.340]   This is my fire sale price."
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.900]   There are many markets around the world that just simply do not work like that.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.660]   They don't have a fire sale price.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.220]   The markets are not based upon the ability to sell quickly.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.300]   I have a lot of friends who own a decent amount of real estate throughout Latin America.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:31.660]   It's one of the interesting vagaries of the Latin American marketplace is that a lot of
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.620]   times you don't need the right price, you need the right buyer.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.500]   And so it's not so much that you're price sensitive, you're buyer sensitive.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.900]   And so there can be an extremely long lead time on those scenarios.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.220]   I would say it's complex.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.540]   And so you can, and if you're going to get the highest margins, you're going to have
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.580]   to choose an area, you're going to have to develop a local team, and largely you're probably
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.020]   going to have some kind of local business come with you.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.940]   Now, many people who buy property, they just buy, "Hey, I want to buy a beach condo in
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.940]   Costa Rica."
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.860]   So they buy some retail beach condo in Costa Rica.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.180]   That's not exactly what we're talking about here.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.260]   I think if you're going to do income property, then you need to choose a market, develop
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.420]   a local team, and answer some of those questions.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.620]   But I couldn't answer them on a global basis.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.140]   They're too localized in nature.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.580]   I'm sorry, it was probably unclear.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.940]   I live outside the US, but I'm looking to buy inside the United States.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.700]   I don't know if that gives a little more focus in terms of finding renters, managing property,
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.700]   etc.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700]   I'm sorry, I didn't say that before.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.700]   Yeah, totally different.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.580]   I mean, well, actually not totally different.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.980]   I mean, the answer is if you're not going to be in the United States, then you're going
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.500]   to have to find someone that's going to work with you.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.100]   So either you have a house â€“ I would say that in the US market, my number one focus
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.700]   would be to try to find low-maintenance tenants.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.420]   And so I think you find low-maintenance tenants by having a certain quality of house and a
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.540]   certain kind of market.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.140]   I would look for that middle-income market.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:09.220]   There are places in the South Florida market where just standard developments where you
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.340]   can buy a big three-bedroom, four-bedroom house and the kind of tenant that you put
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.060]   in there at $2,000 a month or $2,200 a month, at $2,400 a month, that kind of tenant is
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.380]   going to be generally a low-maintenance tenant.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.660]   You can get a very high â€“ someone's got a high credit score, they're a working professional.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:32.660]   It's a very different scenario than if you're managing a trailer park in Central Florida.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.460]   The trailer park in Central Florida will have higher yields, but it's going to be very
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.660]   management-intensive.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.940]   So I would focus â€“ if I'm going to be outside the United States and buying property
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.020]   in the United States, I would focus on low-management properties.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:53.340]   So I would try to find upper-class, middle-class and upper-middle-class tenants.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.020]   And then you're going to need somebody local to help you and then just hire professionals
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.580]   for the various maintenance tasks that are needed.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.860]   Is it probably even also just worth thinking about â€“ I don't love condo investing generally.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.940]   I think it's less advisable, but there may be plimes and places where you just go ahead
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:19.620]   and invest in condos because then your maintenance tasks are handled by your homeowner's fees.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.060]   So run the numbers on that.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.500]   Or you might just walk away from the rental properties completely and invest in some kind
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   of property fund.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.100]   There are wonderful property funds available.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.100]   There are lots of investors who would be happy to do the management for you.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.100]   And I think for an absentee landlord, that should be seriously considered.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.100]   Excellent.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.100]   Thank you for that input.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.100]   I appreciate it.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.100]   Cool.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.100]   I'm going to go on, Mark.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.100]   Do you have one more question?
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.820]   I'm going to go on to the next caller, but I can come back at the end if you've got
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.740]   another question.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.820]   I do have several more, but I will gladly wait until the end.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.100]   I'll swing back to you at the end.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.100]   All right.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.100]   Speaking of overseas, we go to Al in Tbilisi, Georgia.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.100]   Al, welcome to the show.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.100]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.340]   Josh, first off, I very much appreciate what you do.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.140]   And I want to thank you for that.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.140]   Truly, it's great.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.140]   My pleasure.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.060]   So I'm a relatively new listener, but I do believe that I've gone back and listened to
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.060]   most if not all of your episodes that touch upon whole life.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.140]   But I wanted to call personally and get your thoughts on this because I've got my annual
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.660]   review with my insurance agent coming up.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:30.060]   And bottom line, I kind of want to go into this call better armed with a plan, some information
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.140]   than I have generally in the past.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.620]   And normally these calls, my agent will say, "Well, how much more money can you put in
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.620]   the policy?"
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.780]   And that's a hard question for me to answer.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.100]   It could be a lot, it could be a little.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.900]   I don't know where these policies sit in my priorities.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.300]   So I'm trying to understand, should I have a goal?
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.380]   Should it be like a certain death benefit, a certain amount?
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.740]   Or should the premiums be a certain percentage of our income or the premiums are a certain
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.780]   percentage of our investment allotments?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.020]   I'm trying to understand how these policies fit into our broader framework.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.340]   And I can give you detailed numbers if that will help.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:12.460]   But the last piece of background is that I'm looking at taking a one to two year sabbatical
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.900]   and probably six to eight years roughly.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:21.020]   When I look across my expenses, it's really the only one to me that seems I have no control
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.620]   over that as far as drastically reduced.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.980]   That makes sense.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.420]   That is a major disadvantage of whole life insurance.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.980]   Now it can be pitched either as an advantage or as a disadvantage.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.460]   So the advantage is it's a forced savings program.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.300]   That's the way that it's often positioned.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.500]   So for somebody who has poor self-control, who needs to be forced to make a premium payment,
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:48.380]   being forced to make a premium payment into a whole life insurance policy can be an advantage.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.100]   On the other hand, for somebody who wants to keep maximum flexibility of their expenses,
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.180]   take a sabbatical, do an early retirement, have total flexibility, it's a major disadvantage
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.180]   to whole life insurance.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.500]   And you should be very cautious there with the numbers.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.340]   To begin with, tell me just broadly about your financial situation, your income, your
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.300]   assets, your investment component, your investment portfolio, etc.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.780]   So roughly about 125 annual.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.540]   I am in the military, so a good portion of that is non-taxed.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.420]   That's why I'm overseas.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:39.140]   We've got probably another 150, 175 in various IRAs or TSP combos between myself and my wife.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:47.860]   We are continuing to probably save probably 12, maybe 12% of our income into those accounts.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:58.380]   Then we have these policies, which are about maybe 450 in whole life and then another a
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:06.500]   million in term, term till 80 with some conversion options there.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:11.740]   We own two rental properties and I think that's kind of where we're at.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:17.260]   How old are your life insurance policies?
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:27.340]   First one was in 2013 and I've converted a few years, 14, 2018, 2019.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.420]   Sure.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.820]   And total annual premiums into whole life insurance right now?
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.860]   About 680 a month.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.420]   680 a month.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:47.900]   So 680 a month would come out to be about 8,000 a year, which on an income of 125,000.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.420]   Does your wife have additional income on top of your 125?
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:58.140]   She does, but it's almost completely separate because we don't count on that income.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.080]   So that's kind of just getting socked away.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:07.060]   So we're saving about probably 15 to 20,000 a year that's going into investments, taxable
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.220]   events, investments, vendors.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.260]   If you took a sabbatical in six to eight years, a one to two year sabbatical in six to eight
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:20.700]   years, what would be your guess, not including your $8,000 of life insurance premiums, what
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:25.660]   would you guess would be your living expenses at that time?
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:33.380]   I think we could safely probably get down to maybe 2,000.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.220]   We could get into one of our rentals that's paid off.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.580]   We have some flexibility there.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:43.340]   And how old are you and your wife?
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.380]   I'm 36, she's 34.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.180]   Do you guys hope to have children in the future?
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:56.820]   We have a nine month old and hope to have more.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.700]   So the answer to the question is there is no precise answer.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.740]   Now I'll give you a couple of rules of thumb, but the rules of thumb that you hear will
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.380]   vary based upon somebody's commissions that they're going to earn based upon the sale
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.700]   of life insurance.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.740]   For example, somebody who sells whole life insurance will generally recommend a higher
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.420]   amount of whole life insurance than somebody who sells stocks.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.780]   So you got to filter the advice that you hear through that.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:29.300]   So if we start with the assumption that we appreciate the benefits of a whole life insurance
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.980]   policy, a well-built policy with a good company, we appreciate the features and attributes
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   that it gives us.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:42.140]   It's got some unique wrinkles that make it disadvantageous in some circumstances, but
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.500]   on the whole we're comfortable with it.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.980]   The most important thing is to get clear about what our plan is for it.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.980]   Now what you've heard me say in the past is I'm comfortable with whole life insurance
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:26:00.300]   being a component of an overall financial plan where we keep some of our longer term
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.740]   safer dollars.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.300]   That's the positioning that's always made sense to me.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.940]   I don't want to prioritize whole life insurance over a Roth IRA.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.660]   That would be a mistake because a Roth IRA is superior to a whole life insurance policy
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.940]   as long as it's filled with good investments.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.940]   I don't want to prioritize a whole life insurance policy frankly over any kind of tax advantaged
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.920]   account including TSPs, 401ks.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.140]   Although I don't have that as a hard and fast rule, maybe if somebody's â€“ let's say somebody's
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:32.060]   earning $100,000 a year and they're putting $2,000 a year in a whole life insurance policy
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.860]   and they're putting $12,000 into a 401k, I'm not going to freak out, right?
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.060]   But I do like to see Roth IRAs funded and I like to see tax qualified accounts funded
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   first.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.180]   Those accounts are generally superior to whole life insurance as long as the investments
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   work out.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.180]   They're better from a tax perspective and they're better â€“ and they have the potential
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.900]   for longer term growth, for higher longer term growth.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:02.220]   On the whole, stocks and equities should outperform whole life insurance because life insurance
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.820]   is more of a fixed income perspective.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.740]   And so if we flip the question and you just simply said, "What percentage of my investments
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.620]   or my income should I invest into fixed income investments?"
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.900]   Then we start to get closer to the answer.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:23.220]   Now I don't like that analogy perfectly because it still has some trouble.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.740]   For example, I wouldn't recommend to a 36-year-old that you have very much money in fixed income
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.820]   investments unless it's part of your chosen investment strategy.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.540]   So for example, I'm a fan of the permanent portfolio and you say, "I'm going to put
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.460]   25% into bonds because that works during this particular economic situation."
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   Great.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.580]   No problem with that because that's a plan.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.060]   But in general, as far as the mainstream financial planning, should you have a 60/40 portfolio?
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.060]   No.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:54.020]   I think that equities in the long run will outperform fixed income and as long as you
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.380]   don't need the income in the short term or need the money in the short term so you can
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:02.100]   deal with the volatility, you're more concerned about outdoing inflation than you are with
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.360]   temporary short term volatility.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.100]   But life insurance is unique though because unlike some other fixed income portfolios
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:14.740]   or especially unlike a fixed income portfolio in your retirement accounts, you have the
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.660]   ability to access the money temporarily.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.420]   So if you've got a hundred grand in there and you need 50 grand for a down payment on
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.980]   another rental, boom, you grab 50 grand, do the down payment, refinance the property and
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.640]   then go ahead and pay it back.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:32.900]   So it's a really useful asset that doesn't fit well into the mainstream planning solutions
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.100]   and that's where it's so hard to find the advice.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.820]   You have the anti-whole life crowd that says don't ever have any kind of whole life insurance,
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.820]   only buy term insurance, don't have any more.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:51.340]   I think that's â€“ although that plan can work fine, I don't think that that's a thoughtful
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.460]   approach that appreciates the benefits of whole life insurance.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.380]   Then you've got the totally 100% whole life insurance crowd, the bank on yourself, put
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.100]   all the money in life insurance, don't buy stocks, don't buy anything else.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:06.460]   I think that's really â€“ I'm uncomfortable with that and so we're stuck in this frustrating
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.460]   middle.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.260]   So here are some things that I think make sense.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.460]   Number one, if you have hard numbers to your situation, so you specifically have a plan
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   to take a sabbatical, you need to look at what your expected income would be during
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.820]   that period of time.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.620]   Now maybe you look at your rental properties and it sounds like you have one rental paid
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:30.020]   off and that pays you a thousand a month or how much is your income on that?
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:35.180]   That rental will be paid off by the time the sabbatical will come around and yeah, it would
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.620]   be like 800 a month.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.260]   So you could look at that rental and you could say, "You know what?
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.700]   This rental, what this rental is going to do is during the sabbatical, this rental is
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.700]   going to pay my life insurance.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.860]   Now I'm going to have other money of course that I need to pay for living expenses but
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.200]   this rental is going to pay for life insurance."
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.740]   You need to be really careful if you're going to take time off, okay, that life insurance
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.740]   policies are properly structured.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:01.300]   So you've got six to eight years of runway between here and your sabbatical.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.220]   That's enough time to get a policy working pretty well.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.620]   That's enough time where the policies that you bought last year or the year before.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.780]   If you for example make a plan that I'm going to pay these for six to eight years but then
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.440]   at that point in time I'm going to have dividends reduce the premium instead of having dividends
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.740]   by paid up additions, I'm going to turn the dividends to reduce the premium and my net
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.700]   premium outflow instead of being $8,000 a year, my net premium outflow is going to be
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.260]   $2,500 a year.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.340]   That's okay but I don't want you to keep buying more life insurance every single year for
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.120]   the next six years to where you got $15,000 of annual premiums and the policies are too
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.320]   new to cover it.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.020]   So that's a big concern.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.500]   You've got to make sure that you plan for that.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:47.580]   Now if you've got plenty of cash in the bank, you could cover it for a year, it's no problem.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.100]   I've always liked the 5% number.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:55.300]   I've always felt like and depending on someone's â€“ there's no science to this number but
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:01.620]   when you sit down and you say what feels right, to me someone to say I'm going to put 5% of
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:06.820]   my income into something that's conservative, that's safe, etc. that feels pretty good to
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820]   me.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.820]   It doesn't feel like extreme.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.900]   Just like I said the same thing, it's almost like if somebody says the same thing with
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.580]   gold and silver.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.060]   I get really nervous when somebody says I'm going to put 100% of my investments into gold
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.060]   and silver.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.140]   I get nervous when somebody says I'm going to put 50% of my investments in gold and silver
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.660]   but if someone says I'm going to put 5% or 10% of my investments or 5% or 10% of my net
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.020]   worth into gold and silver, okay that doesn't seem extreme.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.660]   So I feel the same way with life insurance.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.920]   5% of your income feels about right because it's not going to control your life.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.520]   You have the ability to reduce your income, etc.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.320]   So that's often been my number.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.100]   If it starts to get higher than that and right now you're at 7%, I feel like that's a little
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.460]   excessive and it doesn't give you enough flexibility.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.280]   So two answers to your question.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   Number one, model the specific numbers.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.620]   What I would ask my insurance agent to do, I would ask him to do a projection and I would
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.640]   say listen, take all my policies together.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.560]   If all your policies are with the same company, I would say take all my policies together,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.960]   aggregate them under one sheet.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   Illustrate that I pay the premiums for the next six years with the dividends going to
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.840]   paid up additions and then in six years illustrate what my premiums would be if I then use my
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.720]   dividends to reduce my premiums.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:31.000]   So now you would know if your total annual premiums are going to go from $8,000 to $4,000.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.520]   And then if in your mind you simply say $8,000, I'm going to have $4,000 of expense, I've
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:41.200]   got this rental property over here that's going to produce $9,000 or $10,000 of net
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.720]   rental income, that's going to pay my life insurance premiums for me, then I'm okay with
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   that.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.760]   But that's the projection that your insurance agent needs to do.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.080]   I'm uncomfortable if you get much more than 5%.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.000]   I feel like that's too heavy.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.240]   I made the mistake when I was a new insurance agent, I made the mistake of selling people
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.200]   too much whole life insurance.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.440]   And it felt good in the short term because I'm like, yeah, this is great, you know, I
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.560]   set them up with a good well-built policy, etc.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.520]   But what I learned was that they would change, right?
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.480]   They would leave a job, they would just decide I'm going to quit and something would happen.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.580]   And then what happened is that then they started canceling the policies.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.000]   And when you cancel a policy two years in, three years in, it stinks.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You lose all your money.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.580]   It's a terrible thing.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.560]   And so I learned, even as an insurance agent who had the bias of getting paid commissions,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.480]   I learned that I would rather pull back and sell less, but have it enforced over the long
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.520]   term.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.640]   And that in order to do that, I needed to make sure that my clients always had tons
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.480]   of flexibility in their cash flow.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.640]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.000]   I really appreciate that.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.120]   I've heard in the past you talk about having additional premiums.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.560]   Or is that, am I too late for that?
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.220]   Because that would have had to been written into the policy when I purchased it.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.540]   Not necessarily too late.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.580]   And so it depends on if you're willing to do additional underwriting.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.660]   So that would be a good option.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.620]   If you've got a little bit of extra cash right now, talk to the insurance agent and tell
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.020]   the insurance agent, listen, I've got some extra money right now that I could put in,
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.120]   but I don't want to convert any more insurance.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.340]   What I'd like to do is see if I can go ahead and add some additional premiums to any of
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.300]   my previous policies.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.140]   And what the insurance agent can do is they can calculate how much additional premiums
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:30.860]   your policies can absorb without turning them into a modified endowment contract, a MEC,
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.400]   which you don't want to do at this stage of your life.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.580]   So they'll calculate how much additional premiums your policies can absorb.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:43.140]   Now anytime you go up with a whole life insurance policy, anytime you go up in amount, face
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.780]   amount, anytime you go up in premium, the insurance company has the right to request
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.900]   additional underwriting.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.940]   So there's no guarantee that you can add additional premiums to the policies now.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.220]   But they may allow it with additional underwriting.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.420]   That underwriting can be simple.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.680]   It might be as simple as a health questionnaire.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.700]   It might be a review of your medical records or it might be a fresh new physical.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.900]   But if you feel like, you know what, I'd like to go ahead and increase a little bit, but
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.220]   I don't want to sign up for new policies, then that would be one good way for you to
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:19.020]   go ahead and for you to go ahead and for you to go ahead and add the premiums.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.620]   The other option you could take, as long as you're at that eight year time horizon for
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:29.260]   your sabbatical, if you want to convert more insurance, then this time instead of converting
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.540]   a traditional whole life insurance contract, build a contract with an eight year premium
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.540]   target.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:41.200]   So in US tax rules, you need to pay premiums on a life insurance policy for at least seven
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   years.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.500]   Otherwise, the policy becomes a modified endowment contract.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.620]   And the reason you don't want the policy to become a modified endowment contract is that
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:56.980]   instead of having tax free access to the cash values in the form of a loan, or instead of
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:04.140]   being able to have tax free distributions of premiums first from the contract, what
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   happens is the money becomes instantly taxable when it comes out as ordinary income.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.780]   You lose those benefits if the policy becomes a modified endowment contract.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:19.480]   And a policy becomes a modified endowment contract if it is either paid in fewer than
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   seven years.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.460]   So for example, a single premium whole life policy is automatically a MEC from day one.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.140]   So either if it's paid for fewer than seven years or if it breaks the seven pay test,
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.820]   which is a test that has to do with how much premium versus how much face amount.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.140]   But you can design a contract that won't trigger the MEC rules, but that is designed to be
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.340]   paid up in seven or eight years.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.960]   So if you've got a six to eight year time horizon, that could work well.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.480]   So what you would do is have the, instead of buying a traditional whole life contract,
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:57.200]   you know, a life paid up at 90 or 100 or life paid up at 65, have them design an aggressive
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:04.180]   contract with a short term quick pay option with lots and lots of additional premiums
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.140]   and have them target eight years to have the premium paid up in eight years and have the
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.160]   policy and have no additional premiums go in after seven years.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.680]   And they can design that for you.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.020]   And so that way you'll know if you buy that contract and you go ahead and convert, you
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:24.220]   know, a $50,000 policy from your term to your whole life, that contract will be scheduled
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:29.380]   to be paid up in, again, in seven years.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.940]   Now you may be able to quick pay some of your other contracts.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:37.140]   So again, if the insurance company will allow you to do it based upon underwriting, and
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.540]   each contract is different, it has to do with what they'll allow, but the insurance company
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.660]   may allow you to go ahead and start quick paying and putting additional premiums into
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.740]   your other contracts, which would accomplish the same thing.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.460]   You should do that first before you buy a new policy.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.260]   Your most efficient contracts to work with are always your older contracts.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.980]   So if the older contracts will allow additional premiums into them and you want to quick pay
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:06.620]   them, then you should do that before you buy a new policy.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.260]   Do you understand that, that the older contracts are more efficient because you bought them
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.540]   when you were younger, they have fewer commissions, et cetera, associated with them?
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.900]   Okay.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.800]   Now the only reason why you would change that would be what would you project your cash
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.620]   flow to be after you are, after your sabbatical?
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.500]   So if I were your insurance agent and you're sitting here and let's say you come in and
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.100]   say, "I just heard this guy on a podcast that told me I could put additional premiums on
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.500]   all my contracts and quick pay them all in seven years," I would say, "Yes, maybe," right,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.060]   depending on the specific language of the contract, if the insurance company will let
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.380]   you do that subject to additional underwriting, but then what are you going to do nine years
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.260]   from now after your sabbatical?
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.980]   Do you not want to be able to put more insurance into the contract?
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.100]   Sorry, put more money into the contract at that point in time?
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.060]   If you didn't want to do that, then quick paying them in seven years would be fine,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:01.620]   but that's the reason why that not every contract is a seven-pay contract because you want to
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.180]   be able to get more money into it.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.740]   So if you put all the money in front loaded over the life of the contract, you'll be able
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.060]   to get less money in over the life of the contract.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.460]   And then you don't want to necessarily be buying more insurance when you're 43 years
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.940]   old and buying new contracts then and starting the process all over would have been better
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.980]   for you to get those, keep those policies that you bought at 33, but where you plan
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   to pay them longer.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:27.820]   I know this is confusing when it's over audio, but there's a balance because when you design
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:32.580]   a whole life contract, you have the death benefit and the cash value.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.380]   And so there's a ratio between these.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.820]   Sometimes as an insurance agent, you design a contract that has a minimal premium for
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:47.300]   the maximum death benefit because the client says, "I need a lot of death benefit."
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.540]   The obvious example there is when you're doing estate planning.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.140]   You need a policy that's enforced forever, so it's got to be a whole life policy.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.420]   Term doesn't work in that situation.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.360]   We're not talking about protecting my children while I got young children.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.780]   That's what term insurance is for.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.620]   We're talking about I want a policy that's enforced for the duration of my life and I
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.820]   want a lot of death benefit.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:10.440]   Well, you can design a very lean policy that has low premiums, but that will keep the death
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.780]   benefit enforced.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.460]   But the cash value in it is very modest.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:19.120]   If you were doing a rate of return analysis, it would be a very, very low rate of return.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.260]   On the other hand, you can have a policy that's designed for minimal death benefit and maximum
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.260]   cash value.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.260]   Why do you want to do that?
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.020]   Well, because the death benefit costs money, whereas the cash value doesn't really cost
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.020]   money.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:36.540]   You've got to follow the rules and have an adequate death benefit, but you can cut the
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.700]   death benefit down.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.300]   You can ramp up the premium as maximum possible, and those policies will perform at the highest
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.980]   possible margin.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   So a quick pay, a seven-pay life insurance policy where you design it with seven years
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.300]   of premiums and then no premiums for then on, will have your highest â€“ with lots of
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.060]   additional premiums inside the policy â€“ will have your highest cash value rate of return
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.480]   of cash on cash.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.660]   So if somebody wants a very rich policy and they say, "Eh, the death benefit, yeah,
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.900]   I mean it's nice to have, but my primary goal is cash accumulation," then you shorten
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.480]   up the policy.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.100]   But then that creates the problem of you're limited as to how much cash you can get into
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   it.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.500]   So that's where you often stretch it out and you say, "Okay, well, if you're going
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.860]   to put $10,000 a year in and you only do this for seven years, you can only get $70,000
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.140]   of cash into it.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.660]   But if you're going to put $10,000 a year in for 25 years, you can get $250,000 of cash
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.660]   into it."
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.380]   When you project forward 20, 25, 30 years, there's going to be a huge difference in
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.500]   the value of those policies based upon the amount of cash that's in them.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.300]   But you've got to build them in the early years.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.500]   And the earlier you start, it's going to be better for you in the long run if you
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.620]   buy the policy when you're 30 years old with $10,000 a year into it, planning to go
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:57.080]   into it for 35 years because you start the contract at 30 years old under the mortality
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:03.140]   table of a 30-year-old who's very unlikely to die rather than doing a seven-pay at 30
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:08.100]   and then doing another seven-pay at 37 and then doing another seven-pay at 43 because
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:13.580]   those mortality tables make a big difference in the overall cash value of the contract.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.860]   So that's why every insurance agent doesn't recommend a seven-pay life from the beginning.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.060]   Man, we got deep into the weeds here.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.020]   The point for your situation is those are your options.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.580]   If you feel like, "I've got excess money that I don't have other profitable investments
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   for.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.860]   I don't want to put more money in my TSP.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.940]   I don't want to put more money into real estate.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.460]   I don't want to put more money into something else," which I want to be clear, at 7% of
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.300]   your income, I feel like that's enough in life insurance.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   That's enough.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   It doesn't need to be more.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   Okay.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.740]   When your income goes up, I don't think you need much more life insurance.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:50.100]   So my first goal, my first recommendation is focus on more aggressive investments, investments
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.180]   with a higher rate of return.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.700]   Can you get rich with life insurance?
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.080]   Maybe but it's going to take a really long time.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.300]   You can get a lot richer a lot quicker by investing the money in much higher returning
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.540]   activities.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.780]   So I don't think you need more life insurance.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:12.180]   If at 7% of your income, unless there's some other factor, I'm unconvinced you need more.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.700]   Number two, second option, if you have excess cash flow that you'd like to put into life
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:23.300]   insurance policies, investigate the option of adding additional premiums onto some of
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.840]   the policies that you have now.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.860]   If the insurance company will allow that, subject to almost assuredly additional underwriting.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.740]   If you can qualify based upon the additional underwriting, fine.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.340]   And there's no reason not to try that if they'll allow you to.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.860]   They can't, based upon additional underwriting, they can't cancel what you've got.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.980]   They'll just allow you to do that.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.500]   Now the insurance agent won't make as much as he will on a new commission for a new policy.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:49.260]   So the insurance agent might not be really anxious to do that, but that if the company
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.500]   will allow it, that's your most efficient way to increase your coverage.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:58.940]   Number three, on the sabbatical, model the income that you expect during the sabbatical,
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.660]   the amount of savings that you expect to have to cover your living expenses on the sabbatical,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:11.380]   and consider if there's a cash flowing asset that will simply pay for your policies.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.540]   Ask the insurance agent to model for you what the totality of your life insurance portfolio
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.380]   would look like six years from now, seven years from now, if you then put all the dividends
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.860]   to reducing the premium, and how much your net premium requirement would be.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:32.620]   And it would probably drop your premiums from $8,000 to maybe $4,000 or $3,500 in the year.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.580]   That solves your cash flow problem.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.700]   Number four, if you do decide to buy more life insurance and you're going to do the
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:43.740]   sabbatical, consider adding a quick pay policy to your portfolio and keeping the rest of
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.500]   them at the standard table.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.220]   So add a seven-pay or an eight-pay life policy to your portfolio, and that's a policy that
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.900]   you can just have now, that you can pay extra into for the next seven or eight years.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:01.340]   And then the rest of the policies will just continue over the long term.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.340]   But you don't want to sign up to where you've got always increasing premiums.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:09.340]   You want your life insurance premiums to slope off as your income goes down.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:14.740]   That's why the classic 65 life is such a great policy.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:21.220]   The classic 65 life policy is a great balance between these things, where it's front-loaded,
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:26.380]   but it's also lined â€“ meaning that it produces more cash value internally than a
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:31.140]   90 life or an ordinary life paid up at 120 under the current mortality tables.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:36.300]   The 65 life is an aggressive policy, but the premiums are scheduled to stop at 65.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.740]   So it works really well where when you go into retirement, it eliminates the need to
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.140]   budget for life insurance.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.740]   I like that idea a whole lot more than I like the idea of you having to budget for life
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:53.740]   insurance off of a volatile equity portfolio, for example.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.740]   This has absolutely been great.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.700]   I definitely will have to probably re-listen a few times to fully digest, but I feel confident
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.100]   now going into this review.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.420]   And thanks for that advice.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.180]   I was thinking that I was getting a little too heavy, and you absolutely confirmed that
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.140]   with a lot more knowledge than I had going into this.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.740]   You're balancing two things.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:21.700]   If you put all your money into some aggressive investment, what's the benefit of that?
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.060]   Well, the benefit of that is that you might make a million, right?
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.220]   You put all your money to some super aggressive business venture or some super aggressive
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:35.460]   speculative investment opportunity, you might come out like a king.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.820]   Fortunes are minted very quickly doing that.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.940]   On the other hand, you might lose it all, and fortunes are lost very quickly doing that.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:49.660]   And so if we're talking about an aggressive investment opportunity, we want to balance
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:50.660]   it.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.660]   We want to say it's useful, but we've got to be careful.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:00.220]   Now on the flip side, the exact same analysis applies for a very conservative investment
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.400]   or savings vehicle like a life insurance policy.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.660]   On the one hand, if everything is super conservative, it could work out, and that's what life insurance
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.140]   does well.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.160]   It's guaranteed to go up, and that is awesome in times of great volatility.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.100]   But the problem is it's never going to go up very much, and so you're never going to
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.520]   get rich quick.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.420]   And so I'm nervous about somebody taking 100% of their wealth and putting it all into an
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   aggressive investment.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.920]   I think that's foolish.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:32.000]   But I still say have the aggressive investment, and by the same method of analysis, I'm nervous
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.220]   about somebody getting too heavy into a conservative investment.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.060]   Somebody who doesn't have any conservative stable income, I think that's a mistake.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.140]   But â€“ sorry, stable investments.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.300]   I think that's a mistake.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:48.420]   I think there are a lot of people right now sweating bullets who all their money is in
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.220]   an S&P 500 index fund, and they've got three months of living expenses.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:58.020]   All of a sudden when there's a global pandemic on hand, and you're looking at three months
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.180]   and saying, "If I lose my job today, how on earth am I going to get employed again
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.540]   in three months, I'm going to be doing door dash deliveries trying to make my bills,"
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.260]   now all of a sudden it seems foolish when you have such massive market volatility to
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.720]   have all the money in the market and have a three-month emergency fund.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.220]   And so that's always where my opinion on life insurance has come in really nicely,
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.540]   that if you've got a couple hundred thousand dollars sitting in a life insurance policy,
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:26.180]   you have a huge amount of cash which buys you the ability to keep investing aggressively,
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:32.300]   to keep going for those home run opportunities, but to do it with a vehicle that's far superior
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.620]   to keeping a couple hundred thousand dollars in a savings account in your local bank.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:41.820]   And so after years of doing it, that's where I've come to with life insurance.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.420]   I gave you a lot of lingo.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.420]   I talked about quick pay.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.540]   I talked about additional premiums.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.540]   The insurance agent will know all those terms.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:54.020]   That's just a bunch of insurance lingo that usually agents don't use with customers
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:59.620]   because it makes their eyes glaze over, but the insurance agent will know those terms.
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.860]   And so if you'll give them those instructions and have them model those things for you,
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.140]   you'll be able to get the right answer.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   Mike: Awesome.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.140]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.140]   I appreciate it.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.140]   Josh: Thanks, Al.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   All right.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.420]   Our other caller dropped off, so we'll pivot back to Mark.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.740]   Mark, go ahead with your next question.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.780]   You probably got 22 of them, but go ahead with your next one.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:21.300]   Mark: Well, I keep a list, so I'll try not to overwhelm you.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.300]   Josh: I like it.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.300]   All right.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:29.980]   The question I have next is, I heard you mention in some call-in show about affirmations, and
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:34.060]   you spoke of it in the context of what you do to encourage yourself when you're down
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.060]   and things like that.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:39.900]   And I just wanted to hear you talk a little bit more about those because I've heard
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:45.180]   self-help gurus speak of it, self-hypnosis, affirmations, things like that, and it just
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.300]   seemed like a lot of psycho mumbo jumbo to me.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.620]   You're intelligent, and you're doing some kind of affirmation.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.540]   And so I was just wondering if you could share a little bit more why, what influence you've
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:03.660]   seen in your life, how you've done it, what purpose they're serving, and how do you
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:09.980]   deal with the already-not-yet aspect of your character that this is who you want to be,
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   and yet it is also often not who you actually are.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:28.340]   It's hard to imagine anybody who's consumed anything out there with regard to self-help
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.460]   or anything who hasn't come across affirmations.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.620]   Usually, I've never seen the movie The Secret.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:42.020]   It made the big notes, but from what I heard about it, I assumed, I may have assumed wrongly,
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.780]   but I assumed like, "This is not for me.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:50.980]   I have no interest in the silliness of just sit and visualize checks flowing into your
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.700]   mailbox," which is how it was caricatured.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:51:01.540]   Sit and visualize checks flowing into your mailbox, and then it'll just happen.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.620]   I think that's silly.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:09.500]   Now, again, I never saw it, so I've never said a negative thing about The Secret because
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.380]   I've never seen it, and I don't say negative things about things I haven't seen other than,
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.900]   I guess, maybe I just did.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.540]   But I'm unattracted to most of that stuff.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:25.640]   I find it very non-attractive because it's just psychological mumbo-jumbo, and a lot
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.340]   of it doesn't work.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:46.180]   On the other hand, if we take a more nuanced view of things, can we say that affirmations
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.180]   don't work?
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.700]   Well, I think that the way we speak to ourself is really, really important.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.420]   For example, I like to use this with my children.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:52:00.500]   If I come across my children and if I hear my child saying, "I'm so stupid," I immediately
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.500]   correct them.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.500]   I say, "Don't ever call yourself stupid.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.300]   You're not stupid," or, "I'm worthless."
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:05.300]   I stop them.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.700]   I say, "Don't ever say things about yourself that aren't true."
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:14.220]   Now, I want to always be honest, so if there's an honest outward expression of, "This is
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:18.380]   the way that I actually am," then fine.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.220]   But I'm not going to allow one of my children to say that they're stupid because they're
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.580]   not stupid.
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.920]   They may have made a foolish mistake.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.380]   They may have failed.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.940]   They may have gotten something wrong.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.220]   They may have been careless.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.620]   Those are all fine.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.780]   I want to affirm the truth, but the truth is that we're not stupid.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.620]   It's like one of the things that my wife is super hardcore about, and I am too, but she's
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.620]   hardcore about it.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.080]   She never calls the dogs bad dogs.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.500]   We never say to the dogs, "You're a bad dog," because they're not bad dogs.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.900]   They're good dogs, but they're dogs.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.060]   They make a mistake.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.620]   This behavior is unacceptable.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.860]   This digging or this boisterousness of something is unacceptable, but I'm not going to do that,
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:01.060]   and I'm not going to say things about myself that tear myself down because the reality
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.020]   is that I am a child of the King.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.660]   That's where I start my affirmations.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.580]   I am a child of the King, right?
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:13.580]   And so for me as a Christian, when I believe that I am a child of God Most High, the God
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:19.220]   who spoke heaven and earth into existence, and that God loves me, and that God died for
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:23.180]   me, and that God forgives me, and that God doesn't hold my past against me, then how
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:27.380]   on earth can I slap Him in the face and say, "Well, I'm worthless.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.380]   I'm no good.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.380]   I'm worth nothing."
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.380]   Nonsense.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.780]   That's an absolute lie.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:38.220]   And so I start every singleâ€¦every time I do an affirmation, I begin with, "I am a
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.980]   child of the King," right?
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:46.820]   I am a child of the King, of God Most High, and there's a reality that flows from that
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.420]   that flows into everything else.
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.700]   Now, I want to always be honest, and so here's where I think we draw the line.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.540]   What can we say honestly about ourselves?
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:03.900]   Well, if I'm not achieving something, then I'm going to honestly acknowledge I'm not
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:09.780]   achieving this because I'm doing something this way, but I'm not going to say to my
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.620]   brain something that is not true.
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.380]   For example, I am not stupid, okay?
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:19.100]   We use these crass, disgusting, like harsh words.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.060]   I am not stupid.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:26.340]   I may behave foolishly, and I will always acknowledge I made a foolish mistake.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.420]   I may behave insensitively, right?
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.940]   I may acknowledge I was insensitive.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.380]   I spoke harshly to you.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.740]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.940]   I may make a mistake.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.820]   I may be ignorant.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:42.860]   I may not be knowledgeable in a certain area, but I am not stupid, and I will never say
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:47.740]   that I'm stupid, and I will never allow anybody else to say that I'm stupid because I'm not
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:48.740]   stupid.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.260]   And in every aspect of life, to me, that's the proper thing.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.220]   Let's say that I'm broke, okay?
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:58.020]   I think it's fine to acknowledge I'm broke, right?
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.020]   I'm broke.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.380]   Don'tâ€”and that's whereâ€”why lie to yourself?
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.980]   Don't say I'm rich.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:08.580]   Say I'm broke, but acknowledge that I don't have to be this way and focus on it.
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:14.460]   Now, to your brain, I think there's very good evidence to believe that what you feed your
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.220]   brain makes all the difference in the world.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:22.860]   So I feed my brain the fact that I am a child of the king, a child of God Most High.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.740]   That transforms my psychology.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.420]   It's one of the most empowering things in the world.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.820]   You know, it's funny.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.140]   I obviouslyâ€”I think a lot about Christian theology.
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.700]   I think a lot about theology of other religions.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.540]   I think a lot about the current debates with secularism in the United States that are very,
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.540]   very strong.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.980]   And I often thinkâ€”I've had this thought.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:45.980]   I've never formalized it in an essay, but I've often had this thought that one of the
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:52.180]   healthiest things about believing in the existence of God, especially the Christian God, is that
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.380]   you create this guaranteed-for-success mindset.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:04.060]   So I believe that God is conspiring and supernaturally ordering all of the circumstances of the universe
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.500]   for my own good.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.500]   That's my belief.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.060]   That's my hardcore conviction.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:14.020]   I believe that the God of the universe who controls the affairs of the world is conspiring
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:22.580]   for me, is conspiring to divinely arrange every circumstance in my life for my own good.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:27.000]   And so when something comes in that I look and I see that this is a blessing, it seems
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.140]   like a stroke of luck, right?
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:35.540]   I'm talkingâ€”I'm trying to conjure in your mind the positive things, the ideas that there's
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.780]   aâ€”you know, something happens to you, right?
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:42.860]   You get a lot of money or you get somebodyâ€”you win, price is right, or something like that.
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:46.260]   Then I believe that God is divinely ordering that for my good.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.700]   And then when I face a challenge, when I face a circumstance that doesn't seem pleasant
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:55.100]   from the outside, I believe that God is divinely ordering that for my good, because I don't
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.380]   believe that only the things that feel like blessings are actually blessings.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.300]   I believe that the hard times are blessings.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.460]   I believe that the difficult circumstances are blessings.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.220]   I believe that God disciplines those he loves.
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.480]   So if I'm under the discipline of God, I know that God loves me.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.980]   And what this creates is it creates this fabulously robust psychology where you basically go through
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:17.300]   life being convinced that the world is conspiring for your good.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:23.580]   Now if I compare that to the psychology of some of my friends who areâ€”my friends who
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:24.580]   don't believe in God, right?
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.620]   They don't believe that God exists.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:31.560]   They have to contendâ€”and so I begin with God foreknew me.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.740]   Before he created the world, God foreknew me.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:37.260]   He knew that he was going to create Joshua sheets with these unique characteristics and
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.260]   attributes.
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:44.860]   And then God foreknew that he was going to divinely order Joshua's life in the perfect
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:50.740]   way for Joshua's good, so that Joshua's life on earth could be richly meaningful and
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:56.180]   satisfactory and fulfilling, and so that Joshua's eternal life can be filled with joy in the
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.900]   presence of God.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:06.380]   Now compare that to my friends who, by virtue of their worldview, are forced to believe
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:13.660]   that their existence is an accident of time, that their existence is pure happenstance
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:18.180]   of biological chemical properties over which they have no control.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:23.400]   And in fact, the very essence of their life, their very ability to make decisions, is actually
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:31.380]   something that's out of their control, because they're subject to random mutations of cells,
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.020]   random chemical processes, and that creates the stuff of life.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:40.260]   Well, you could imagine why it's difficult for people with that worldview to stay away
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.820]   from abject nihilism, right?
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:43.820]   It's hard.
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:47.820]   Now there are people who do it, but they usually ignore the natural consequences of their worldview.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:52.100]   And so when I think about affirmations, I want to affirm what is true, and so I have
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.260]   no problem affirming what is true, that God loves me.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.260]   I'm a child of the King.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.860]   He divinely foreknew me.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:02.100]   Before he knit me in my mother's womb, he knew who I was going to be.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:07.700]   And every circumstance in my life is providentially provided for my good.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:14.300]   And so if that circumstance is joyful, if that circumstance feels really fun, if I'm
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:19.380]   rich, if I'm well-liked, et cetera, praise the Lord.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:26.660]   If that circumstance seems like a trial, if I'm poor, if I'm abused, if I'm discriminated
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.140]   against, praise the Lord.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:32.020]   This is something that God has provided for me.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:38.420]   So I didn't mean to get so theological, but to me, that's an empowering, a powerful psychology.
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:43.140]   And again, I've often thought thatâ€”now, I think we should be honest, right?
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.140]   Honesty is important.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   If someone just doesn't believe that God exists, you're not.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:49.660]   If someone's on the fence, I often thought, like, "Dude, you ought to just embrace a
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:53.540]   theistic worldview because it'll radically transform your experience of life."
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:58.220]   When you believe that the world is conspiring against you for your good and that everything
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:03.780]   that comes into your life is providentially arranged for your benefit, it totally transforms
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780]   your experience of life.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.860]   Now, back to affirmation.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:12.380]   You could take a softer view of affirmations, and you could say that affirmations activateâ€”I
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.220]   call it the reticular activating system.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.340]   I've never looked it up and seen if that's actually true, but all the self-help people
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.660]   say it.
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.620]   And so the example that's always used is the red sports car.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.660]   You think about buying a red sports car, or your brother buys a red sports car, and all
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.460]   of a sudden you see red sports cars everywhere.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:33.880]   To me, I think that's absolutely, unequivocally, without question true, that what you focus
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.700]   on is what you see.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.460]   And so think about this, right?
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:45.940]   In the current scenario, if you focus on racism and you spend all your days talking about
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:52.820]   racism, thinking about racism, reading about racism, worrying about racism, railing against
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:58.140]   racism, basically all you see in your life is racism.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:05.420]   Now, on the other hand, if you look around and you say, "I'm going to look forâ€”" and
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:11.380]   you focus on non-racism, or anti-racism, or racial reconciliation, and you look around
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:16.780]   and all you think about is racial reconciliation and cooperation, and all you talk about is
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.420]   racial reconciliation and cooperation, and all you read about is racial reconciliation
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:26.700]   and cooperation, what happens is basically all you see is racial reconciliation and cooperation.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.340]   Now that doesn't require you to ignore what is.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.180]   It's fine to acknowledge what racism is.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.460]   Okay, this bad exists.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.740]   I think it's foolish to be ignorant and say that this bad exists.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.340]   But what you focus on is where your attention goes, and where your attention goes is where
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.060]   you wind up spending most of your time.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:50.780]   And so to the extent that I spend my time focused on opportunity for myself, I see nothing
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.140]   but opportunity.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:56.000]   To the extent that I focus on the good things happening in the world, right?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.060]   In the last decade, millions of people have come out of poverty, and to me, that's exciting.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.740]   And so because I spend all my time focusing on that, then I see it.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:12.460]   Now every time I let myself go away from that, if I start thinking about catastrophe, or
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.640]   economic crisis, or all this stuff, what happens is it just builds, and you see this again
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.640]   and again.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.180]   Somebody starts worrying about, "Well, there's going to be an economic crisis," and then
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.260]   it just gets a hold of them, and they focus, and they focus, and they focus, and they focus,
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.100]   and it almost becomes this self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.060]   So I try to handle it with honesty.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.860]   I try to acknowledge economic catastrophe could come.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.940]   Racism could happen.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.060]   But I'm not going to spend time there.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.060]   I'm going to focus on what's good.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:44.340]   And so what affirmations do is they always focus your mind, and they focus your attention.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.140]   Now the final thing that's been helpful for me, what I have always sought to do is be
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:55.460]   honest in affirmations, and to use things that are areas where I'm convinced they're
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.460]   skills.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:01.860]   So the person who made this click for me, the motivational person, was Zig Ziglar.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.140]   And Zig Ziglar made a statement.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.740]   I used to drive to work every day, and I have binders of Zig Ziglar CDs, and I would listen
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.980]   to Zig.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.140]   And I liked his personality.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:16.020]   I liked his kind of charming, down-home, southern accent and everything.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.540]   And I would listen to Zig, and Zig made the point, and he talked about almost all of the
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:28.460]   attributes that we admire are not things that are put into you, but they are skills.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.700]   And when he used that word "skill" and hammered that into my head, it radically transformed
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.620]   the way that I think about things.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.700]   And it's even radically transformed my parenting.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.860]   Like with my children, I don't talk about attributes.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.940]   I don't talk about things that are there.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:43.740]   I believe there are immutable attributes.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.420]   I can't change my height.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.620]   I can't change my skin color.
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:53.660]   I can't change my eye color or my hair color without the obvious cosmetic solutions.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.540]   What I can change, though, are my skills.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:02.380]   And when I realized that the vast majority of the things that matter in life are skills
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:08.580]   that can be learned and practiced and developed, it allowed me to make affirmations in a really
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.620]   positive and without fear of error.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:18.940]   So the self-taught card that I memorized when I was younger was Zig's self-taught card.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.340]   And I still have this.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:30.980]   What I have doneâ€”I'll share my geeky secretsâ€”what I do is I go to YouTube and I put on movie
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   soundtracks.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.660]   And so they have these movie soundtracks, you know, Pirates of the Caribbean or Lord
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.660]   of the Rings.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.380]   These are these rich, uplifting music.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.620]   And I play the music as a music bed.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.660]   And then I record my own voice saying my affirmation and I keep that on my phone.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:52.580]   So anytime I want to, I can just hit play and I can hear myself actually doing my affirmations.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.340]   And you know, hold on a second, Mark.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.340]   I hate this.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.940]   It makes me feel weird, but I'll play it.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.940]   Just a moment.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.940]   Hold on a moment.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.340]   Mark, you're not going to be able to hear this because it's not going to come through,
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   but you'll be able to listen to this later.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.340]   But I'll just play this for a minute for the audience.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.100]   And this is my morning affirmation.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.100]   This is Geeky Joshua.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.780]   So a good payoff for those who are an hour and five minutes into a podcast.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:36.300]   Here we go.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.620]   I am a child of the king.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:44.060]   I live each and every day in the will of God.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:49.180]   I listen for the voice of the Holy Spirit in every moment of every day.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:55.300]   And I am sensitive to his leading in all things.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:06:01.000]   I pray without ceasing, asking God to give me the wisdom, discernment, and strength that
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.940]   I need in every moment.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:10.700]   I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   I claim the following attributes because I have the mind of Christ, the power of the
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:22.860]   indwelling Holy Spirit, and I am a son of the most high God, maker of heaven and earth.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:28.060]   Although I am weak in some of these qualities, I am specifically commanded to let the weak
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.580]   say that I am strong.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.460]   Thus, I am strong.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.660]   By God's grace, I am strong.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:44.020]   Through Christ who gives me strength, I am strong.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.500]   By claiming and developing these biblical qualities, I will become the person God created
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.700]   me to be.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:54.740]   I will glorify God in all things and my life will benefit mankind.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:05.420]   I am an honest, intelligent, organized, responsible, committed, and teachable person who is sober,
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:12.860]   loyal, and who clearly understands that regardless of who signs my paycheck, I am self-employed.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:20.220]   I am an optimistic, punctual, enthusiastic, goal-setting, smart-working self-starter who
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:26.900]   is a disciplined, focused, dependable, persistent positive thinker.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:33.380]   I have tremendous self-control and I am an energetic and diligent team player.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.500]   I'm a hard worker who appreciates the opportunity that my business and the free enterprise system
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.100]   offer me.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:46.020]   I am thrifty with all of my resources and I apply common sense to my daily tasks.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.740]   I take honest pride in my competence, appearance, and manners.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.780]   I am motivated to be and do my best so that my healthy self-image will remain on solid
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.900]   ground.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:03.240]   These are the qualities which enable me to manage myself and give me the stable character
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.420]   that I need to succeed in all things to which I put my hand.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:16.100]   I am a compassionate, respectful, encourager of others who is a considerate, generous,
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:23.420]   gentle, patient, caring, sensitive, personable, attentive, and fun-loving person.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.820]   I am supportive of others in their needs and goals.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:34.500]   I am a giving person, quick to forgive all people for all things, clean, kind, unselfish,
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:41.660]   affectionate, loving, family-oriented human being, and I am a sincere and open-minded
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:48.300]   good listener and good finder.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.540]   I am trustworthy.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:54.420]   These are the qualities which enable me to build good relationships with my associates,
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.380]   neighbors, spouse, and family.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.220]   I am a man of integrity with the faith and wisdom to know what I should do and the courage
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.460]   and convictions to follow through.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.180]   I have the vision to manage myself and to lead others.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:14.580]   I am authoritative, confident, and humbly grateful for the opportunity life offers me.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:23.060]   I am fair, flexible, resourceful, creative, knowledgeable, decisive, and an extra miler
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.660]   with a servant's attitude who communicates well with others.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:32.180]   I am a consistent, pragmatic teacher with character, and I have a finely tuned sense
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.660]   of humor.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:39.940]   I am an honorable man and am balanced in my personal, family, and business life.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:45.940]   I have a passion for being, doing, and learning more today so I can be, do, and have more
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.260]   tomorrow.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:51.140]   These are the qualities of the winner I was born to be, and today I will develop these
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.380]   qualities to achieve my worthy objectives.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:10:01.340]   Today is a brand new day, and it's mine to use in a marvelously productive way.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.420]   Thank you, Lord, for allowing me to be awake and alive today.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:12.220]   May I know your strength, power, and wisdom in every moment of this day.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:24.700]   So, it's probably a little embarrassing to acknowledge that stuff, but for me, the nice
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:30.140]   thing is it's a five-minute audio file that I can just simply play easily for myself.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.740]   It sits on my phone.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.940]   It's a five-minute audio file, and the nice thing about it at five minutes is that five
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.300]   minutes is exactly the amount of time that I need to do a French press, to wait for my
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.900]   French press coffee to go down in the morning.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:47.540]   And so, when you begin a day with that, and everything that I said in that, and I've never
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:52.580]   planned for that to be played, but everything that I said in that is absolutely unequivocally
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.780]   true.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.900]   I'm an optimistic person, and so whenever I hear and say that every day, "I'm optimistic,"
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.260]   then it reminds me, "I'm optimistic."
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:05.980]   And what happens is when you declare things that are true, you notice the ways that you're
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:06.980]   slipping.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:12.020]   You notice where things are starting to go, but all of those things are skills.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.060]   All of those things are things that can be developed, and so that was the thing that
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.260]   brought me the fresh understanding of my willingness to use an affirmation.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.380]   Now, there are other things as well.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.740]   I do this weird, again, I'm not going to play this one, but I do this weird thing as well
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.680]   where I put the movie soundtrack on, and I often record my goals, and I have my list
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.780]   of goals, and I can do that, because a lot of times, I don't feel like sitting and standing
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.220]   in front of the mirror and staring at myself.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:39.860]   I don't like to make my goals obvious, but I like to listen to them, and so it makes
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:44.540]   me happy to listen to my goals, and I got a good soundtrack underneath, and I record
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:48.620]   myself, and I listen to myself sketching those out, because as those pictures in my head
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.740]   affirm, then what happens is they become clearer.
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:12:00.300]   And to the extent that those character qualities, those affirmations, if I say that I am confident,
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:05.060]   if I say again and again, "I am authoritative, confident, and humbly grateful for the opportunity
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.100]   life offers me," then it allows me to recognize, "You know what?
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.220]   I'm not behaving confidently at the moment.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.980]   I'm not doing this right now."
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:19.500]   And almost every day, when you listen to that list of attributes and that list of characteristics,
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.340]   you think about one thing that you can change, and then that progress just creates a self-fulfilling
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:28.320]   prophecy where you change one thing day after day after day, and then you become more and
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.060]   more and you embody these character qualities.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:35.180]   So I think that's why affirmations matter, is you have to model for yourself.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:40.780]   You have to clearly sketch out exactly what you're going for, exactly what you're building,
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.620]   exactly the kind of person that you want to be, and then hold that clearly in your head.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:49.900]   And the way that your brain gets input is through your eyes, through your ears, and
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.100]   through your other senses.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.740]   And so, you know, people who put things on their wall, I used to do that.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:59.220]   I used to, you know, create a vision board, but at this point I've found that most of
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:04.260]   those things, they're not particularly visualizable, although I still do have that.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.900]   I keep them on my iPad.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.620]   And so you can be simple as you create an album on your phone that has pictures of things
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.980]   that inspire you, but most of the things that inspire me are non-physical, they're non-tangible.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.460]   And so I find the audio description of them really powerful.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:24.380]   So that's my lengthy answer to your question about affirmations, is that I only affirm
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:30.620]   things that are true, because I'm notâ€”one of my most important affirmations is that
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.940]   I'm honest, right?
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:37.300]   I am an honest man, and honesty starts with myself, and so I've never been able to lie
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:41.860]   toâ€”I've never been willing to lie to myself and then claim honesty to other people.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:47.100]   And soâ€”but all of those things that I said in that, they're true.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100]   They are absolutely true.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:53.540]   Now, they might be true in small quantities, which is totally fine, right?
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:59.380]   I'm happy to acknowledge that these are things that I have in modest qualities, but I'm getting
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.380]   better, right?
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.380]   Today's a good day.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.380]   I have this, and I'm getting better.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:07.660]   And that's what I teach my children, is that life is a function of skills.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.220]   And so you have this.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:13.740]   I never use "you are" language unless it's something that you actually are.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.900]   So I'm happy to say to my children, "You are a child of the king."
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.260]   But I'm not willing to say to my child, "You are lazy."
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:25.180]   I'll say, "You're behaving in a lazy way.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:27.180]   You're practicing laziness.
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.580]   You need to change your behavior," because those things are behavior.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.580]   You're not lazy.
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.780]   "You are diligent, and you're proving that to yourself by behaving diligently."
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:41.100]   So hopefully that's a balance of between kind of the mystical world.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.100]   Some people like it.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:47.100]   I just feel like there's so many lies in that world that it causesâ€”it can be a real danger.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:53.260]   Everybody is so focused on only saying things that are positive, only being optimistic.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.140]   There are times in life when you need to run, run away, and you don't just sit there and
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:02.900]   if somebody's coming and attacking you, don't just close your eyes and say, "I live a peaceful
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:03.900]   life."
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.740]   No, you turn around and run away, or you go and fight.
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.700]   And so a lot of the namby-pamby world of self-development, I feel like it's just simply not honest.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:16.340]   But there's also a point in which you find freedom when you're honest, but you find freedom
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.060]   when you continually focus on the things that are positive.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:22.860]   So Mark, I know you couldn't hear the five-minute audio file that I played.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:25.940]   You can come back and listen to it later, but did that get close to some of your concerns
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:30.420]   and give you some thoughts from my perspective?
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.420]   That was awesome.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.940]   That was exactly what I was looking for.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:37.860]   Thank you for sharing that and for the vulnerability ofâ€”or maybe notâ€”but the vulnerability of
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860]   sharing your affirmations.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.460]   I look forward to listening to that.
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.460]   Cool.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.340]   All right, man, I got one more caller who popped on after the other one left.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:47.540]   So I'll call back in next week with your other questions, and I thank you for the questions.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.260]   We'll finish up in the great state of Indiana.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.260]   Welcome to the show.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.260]   How can I serve you today?
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.260]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:53.260]   This is Andy.
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:16:01.620]   This fits in with the theme you've had so far, but a question about sort of in this
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:10.140]   particular time, developing the home strategy that you've talked about for troubled times
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:14.020]   versus a place to go.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.100]   I have a piece of property.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:22.700]   We have some acreage, but we're fairly new to it, and it's not super self-sufficient
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:23.700]   yet.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:30.220]   I'd like for it to be someday, and I'm just sort of wondering how you would go about
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:36.140]   thinking of continuing to develop that right now today with the money that I have and more
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:44.820]   in the near future versus something more along the lines of taking a vacation somewhere we
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:53.020]   want to move potentially if we needed to leave the area that we're in and just sort of not
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.940]   necessarily setting down roots there, but getting that idea of could we live here, do
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:02.900]   we like it, is it as safe as it looks online, that sort of thing versus putting in solar
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:08.180]   panels or buying animals or whatever to make our current place more sustainable?
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:14.580]   I need to do an update show with kind of what I see happening with the current pandemic,
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:22.060]   the current coronavirus pandemic, but I do not see at the moment, I do not see any kind
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:28.980]   of precipitous event in the United States.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:35.820]   I have been â€“ so first, one of the surprising things that I have learned from this current
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:42.820]   pandemic is how excruciatingly slow it is, and I had thought that intellectually.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.340]   If you go back and listen to the shows I did on the pandemic at the end of January, I said
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:50.140]   that one of the reasons a pandemic is really bad is because it's really, really slow
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:54.940]   to come on, and it's really slow to hang around, and it's really slow to go away,
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.140]   and the slowness is frustrating and furious because you never know if you're making the
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.520]   right decision.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.700]   If your house is on fire, literally, then you know I've got to move now, and you immediately
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.960]   spring into action and you respond.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.300]   If there's an earthquake, then you know that, yes, I should go and use my stores of
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:16.100]   water, right, because there's been an earthquake, but a pandemic is not like that.
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:17.100]   It's so slow.
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.020]   You never know, am I preparing appropriately?
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.020]   Am I overpreparing?
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.140]   Am I underpreparing, et cetera?
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:29.340]   It's just maddening, and even through this current scenario, we're living in a disaster,
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.140]   but on the whole, it's not the end of the world as we know it.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.140]   The internet still works.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.140]   The power still works.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.740]   There's still been food on the shelves.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:40.660]   There were some real concerns about food shortages some months ago.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:45.540]   I was concerned about those things, but thankfully, most of them, although there were shortages
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:49.460]   in the United States, and there are shortages around the world right now, most of those
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:54.060]   shortages were not as severe as feared, and so that's great.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:58.100]   Now, on the other hand, we're stuck in this maddening middle of the ground world, so right
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:04.980]   now nonpayment of rent, massive increase.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.260]   They're going to start to be â€“ we're starting to head into foreclosure season.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.820]   We're coming up on the end of the excess unemployment compensation that the US government
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.580]   authorized.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:17.740]   The pandemic is just really in many countries of the world kicking off, and where it's
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:21.860]   got an exponential curve in many places, and it's growing and growing and growing.
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.260]   You still see borders closed.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:26.580]   You still see â€“ the risk has not gone away.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:32.340]   Meanwhile, in the United States, what is really frustrating is it's not been an isolated
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.060]   medical problem.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:40.740]   In some places, it is more treated and has been more treated as an isolated medical debate,
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:46.300]   but in the United States, all of the political strife and all of the tension in the society
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:51.700]   has exacerbated the decision about â€“ the arguments about the medical stuff, and so
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:55.860]   it's almost impossible right now to separate most people's opinions about the medical
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:01.020]   stuff from their political views, and that's really frustrating because it makes it for
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:05.020]   kind of a more volatile situation.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:14.540]   But that said, I don't see why the pandemic should cause a precipitous, immediate calamity.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:20.500]   I think that the economic effects have been less severe than I worried about, and I think
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:25.860]   that we should be grateful that they're less severe due to our ability to be connected
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.660]   by knowledge work done through the Internet.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.620]   If we were to go back to the early 20th century and we were to relive this pandemic in that
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:37.700]   situation, just imagine how devastating it would be when you can only work face-to-face
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:42.660]   with people, and yet businesses are shut down and people are not able to â€“ no one's
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.820]   able to interact.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:48.140]   But in today's world, the majority of the most productive people, the highest earning
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:51.220]   people, the most productive people who keep most companies going, most of that is knowledge
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:55.500]   work, and they've been able to keep going because they're just entering into a new
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.120]   situation of working from home, doing knowledge work.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.540]   So I don't see a precipitous, calamitous scenario in the current environment.
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:07.660]   I think that even â€“ like, what's concerning?
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:12.300]   Well, I think the election is going to be really concerning in November, because no
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:16.860]   matter who wins, I think that there's going to be a whole lot of people who are angry
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.500]   and frustrated about that.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.180]   It's hard for me to see a scenario in which we don't come out the other side with a
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:28.340]   whole bunch of people angry and ready to be the resistance, no matter the outcome.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:33.940]   But at the end of the day, that's fairly isolated, even though, yes, there are riots
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:34.940]   in lots of cities.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940]   That's a big city problem.
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.700]   So if you're living in downtown New York, I would be saying, "Don't put a solar
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.940]   panel on your roof.
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:47.020]   Go and get your extended â€“ your property out in the country."
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.820]   If you're living in downtown Chicago, no, you need a place to go, and so that should
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:51.820]   go up.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:56.620]   But for you, living on some acreage in Indiana, I don't see any reason why that wouldn't
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.820]   be a perfectly viable place to be.
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:07.040]   And so I would just do more of the same, and I would focus on more on the long, slow decline,
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.340]   and how do I do well in the midst of it, building local community, et cetera, rather than worrying
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.980]   about running to the other side of the country.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:21.980]   One of the things that has been remarkable is how travel freedom has basically imploded.
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:27.460]   As a US passport holder, there's not many places in the world you can go.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:34.900]   And for all of the strengths of my conversation and advice about the value of being able to
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:41.460]   translate from one place to another, the pandemic, the global pandemic, certainly shows that
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:48.000]   it does not work in the global pandemic, at least not with just one â€“ not with one passport.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.380]   When I first released my "How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis"
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:58.460]   course, I focused a lot in that course on how my students could gain multiple passports,
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.900]   multiple citizenships, how they could establish residency permits in other countries, et cetera.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:07.980]   Then after about six months of even doing all the stuff that I recommended in that course,
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.460]   I came to the other side and I released an update to my students.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:15.660]   And I said, "One of the things that I've changed my opinion on is that a lot of this
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:17.540]   stuff is no longer necessary."
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:21.460]   I said, "If you've got a passport from a strong country, a US passport, a Canadian
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:25.500]   passport, a British passport, a German passport, whatever, like a good strong passport, not
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:30.780]   a Pakistani passport, not a Syrian passport, but a strong passport with significant levels
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:34.820]   of travel freedom, my answer was, you probably don't need residence permits.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:37.900]   You probably don't need passports, second passports, et cetera.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:41.820]   Just having one is good to go."
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:48.940]   Seeing the pandemic though, I've changed my mind again and I've been willing to raise
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.820]   the importance of some of those things.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:59.420]   Right now, if a US passport holder had a simple, you know, Dominica passport or a St. Lucia
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:05.140]   passport or a Granada passport or a St. Kitts passport, a Caribbean citizenship by investment
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:11.020]   passport that they paid $100,000 to $150,000 for depending on the family structure, that
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:16.900]   person has untold travel freedom that US passport holders simply don't have on a global basis
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.340]   right now.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.460]   And how long will this continue?
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:21.460]   I don't know.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.580]   But I'm not â€“ I got off track there, Andy.
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.900]   I'm not worried about a precipitous thing at the moment.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:30.460]   I think it's always good to be familiar with the precipitous thing, but I'm not freaking
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.460]   out.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.540]   I think that this is much more likely to be a long, hard recession and not as long or
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:40.540]   hard as I feared several months ago, but a long, hard recession of more ordinary quality
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:44.660]   rather than any kind of Mad Max, end of the world as we know it, shooting our neighbors
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.140]   in the street kind of scenario.
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.060]   >>Andrew: Okay, thanks.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:55.500]   So you'd say, I guess I wasn't necessarily speaking about the current pandemic situation
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.940]   so much as just if I â€“ you wouldn't see a problem with continuing to the next year
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:09.580]   or two to pretty well pour all of my excess money into a fixed location and improving
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:15.900]   that while having very undeveloped other places to go.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:16.900]   >>Steve: I wouldn't.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.260]   Do you have a car or a pickup truck or a trailer?
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.260]   >>Andrew: Yeah.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:24.540]   >>Steve: So you've got more than a lot of people.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.980]   And at the end of the day, maybe you pick up a $1,000 travel trailer somewhere, an old
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:35.180]   kind of junky travel trailer that you can have beds in and have your children in.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.380]   But I think that having some simple plans like that is sufficient.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:42.900]   If you've got a pickup truck and a couple thousand dollar travel trailer, then you've
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.220]   got the ability to go somewhere.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:51.340]   And what I've always done is just have camping gear and I could roll up in a national park
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:55.460]   two states away and if I've got â€“ you don't have to have the travel trailer, right?
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.020]   A tent is fine or a van or a trailer.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.340]   A cargo trailer with some cots inside can be very, very comfortable.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:09.180]   But if I can roll up on a national park, I can set up a propane stove and I got a couple
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.180]   bottles of propane.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.540]   That doesn't cost much.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:12.660]   I've got cookware.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:17.420]   I've got food including shelf stable and storage food that's easy to toss in the trailer and
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.420]   take with me.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:21.540]   I've got cots that are comfortable to sleep in so we're not going to be sleeping on the
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.300]   ground like millions of people around the world are doing right now.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:29.380]   I've got a battery or a generator and some stored fuel.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:34.940]   I've got the ability to have electric lights and that makes all the difference in the world.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:39.140]   If I've got the ability to get some water so that we can keep clean, I can live very
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:43.420]   comfortably and I guess to me, yes, that should be done.
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.580]   But your total cost in that is probably â€“ I mean you probably have all that stuff already.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:51.660]   It's just a matter of thinking through what would I take and where.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:27:00.740]   And so in the United States, right now I've been continuing to be involved in relief work
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:04.900]   in Venezuela and one of the things that's happening right now is that many Venezuelans
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.500]   left Venezuela.
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:11.420]   They went to other places, Colombia to try to find work.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:18.140]   But what's happening is due to the nightmare of coronavirus, the economy in Colombia has
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:19.140]   collapsed.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:22.540]   And so now all the refugees are going back the other way.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:27.180]   And there's one church that we support that's involved at the border and they provide food
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:32.940]   for refugees and they provide supplement for nursing mothers in a place where they can
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.380]   breastfeed their babies and clean water sources for the travelers, etc.
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:42.800]   In the last three months, they've quadrupled in the number of people that they're serving
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.880]   in the last three months.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.740]   But it's primarily now people going back the other way of people fleeing from Venezuelans,
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:56.900]   leaving Colombia, heading back into Venezuela simply because it's bad in both situations,
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:01.300]   but they're provided â€“ but at least it's familiar in Venezuela.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.780]   And so â€“ but what it is though is those people â€“ and I don't publish this stuff
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.500]   online, but those people are sleeping on dirt, right?
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:14.460]   They have a sheet that they carry and they spread out a sheet on an empty soccer field
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.340]   that has a dirt floor, not even grass, and they spread out the sheet and that's where
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:20.580]   they sleep and they got nothing or one little blanket to put over them.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:26.140]   And so when you come to the context that you live in as an American, to have a little cargo
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.260]   trailer that you can hook up to your pickup truck and have some cots in that so you can
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:33.100]   be out of the rain, have a tent that you can set up to store your stuff in if you're
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.900]   sleeping in the cargo trailer, have a propane stove that you can cook on, have some food,
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.980]   have some water, I think that's sufficient.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:45.700]   I think that to go beyond that is not necessary for the vast majority of people.
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:49.860]   If you got 10 million bucks, get the missile â€“ build the bunker in the missile silo,
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:50.860]   no question.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:54.540]   But for ordinary circumstances, I don't think you need anything more than that.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.580]   >>Steve: Great, thank you.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.580]   >>Adam: My pleasure.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.860]   Thank you all for listening to today's Q&A show.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.260]   I appreciate your being here.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.460]   If you'd like to join us next week on the Q&A show, as you can see, you can talk to
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.380]   me about anything.
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.540]   Sometimes when you get me on a Q&A show, I'm willing to share things honestly.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:21.420]   I never would put out a recording of my morning affirmation thing in a normal show.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.220]   I would just never expose myself like that.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.200]   It's too humbling to do that.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.260]   But a lot of times you catch me in a Q&A show, sometimes you get that out of me.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:34.700]   So I invite you to go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up for the show on Patreon, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.060]   and join me on next week's Q&A show.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:36.740]   Have a great week, everybody.
