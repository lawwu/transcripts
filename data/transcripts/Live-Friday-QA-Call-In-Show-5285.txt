[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.440]   Make it work then that's when I do so working out the details on how to do a live show
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.960]   What with Q&A with video live streaming on the internet on Facebook on YouTube
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.920]   YouTube and all over the place. That's today's challenge, but I think we got it worked out mark. You're up first
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.180]   Welcome to radical personal finance. How can I serve you today?
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.180]   Mark can you hear me?
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:42.160]   Okay, we are going to go to the backup plan here real quick hang on the phone lines
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.520]   We're gonna switch internet networks and see if we can fix the problem
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   Just
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.960]   A minute here guys. Thanks on the live stream. We'll get this going in just a second here

[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   Okay
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:27.960]   Let's try again mark, can you hear me mark? You're up. Can you hear me now?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.160]   Mark you're up in first plate. Can you hear me now? I can't hear you
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.400]   All right
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.580]   Hold on a second mark. It looks like that's you over there. Try again
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.760]   Okay, can you hear me now now I can hear you somehow I had to go to the backup internet network
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.160]   And we're there but we're live now. Welcome mark. How can I serve you today, sir? Oh great. Excellent. I
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.440]   Have two questions for you. I have a house buying question and a side business
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.240]   Question for you. Okay, let's do it
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.340]   Do you care which ones first? Okay, so
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.800]   First is we're preparing to buy a house in roughly a year
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.160]   I spoke to you previously about this and so I'm trying to make sure my credit is in the right spot
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.720]   we are around 770 and the main reason is just our
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.280]   age of credit is too
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   Frequent too young and so we just have to wait for that. But the secondary reason is our mix is
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.720]   Not mixed they just I've only ever had credit cards
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.240]   And so I was wondering or considering looking at taking out a quote-unquote credit building loan
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.880]   It would not put a hard inquiry on my credit report
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.800]   But instead would get reported as a loan essentially what the banks do is they give you a loan they put it in a
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.680]   Certificate of deposit then you quote-unquote pay it back until the loan matures
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.040]   And so it's a way to add in a little different kind of credit. Is that something you're familiar with?
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.200]   Do you recommend it doesn't make any difference. I know it's only 10% of the mix. Yes
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   So yes, yes, and yes, it definitely is important to have a mixture of the different credit types
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.280]   and so if all you have is credit cards and you want to
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.440]   improve your credit score then you definitely want to start by going ahead and
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.200]   Moving in the direction of adding in but more of a diversity add in a car loan add in a bank loan add in some
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.060]   Kind of installment loan and that will improve your credit score
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.080]   Excellent that's good to know excellent that was quick the second question
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   Have started a new venture
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.160]   Seen it the prepared expat
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.880]   and so I've
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.880]   I'm trying to develop it into a
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.200]   Kind of side business have a vision for where it goes and I'm debating whether to make it written form
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.680]   a podcast or both and I was wondering your advice on how to think through
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.240]   making that decision of medium
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.960]   Did you hear at the end of last Friday's Q&A where I talked about
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.280]   Kind of my new venture and I talked with a listener who was thinking about building some kind of local media platform to meet people
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:36.200]   Okay, so let me
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.360]   Because in the last Friday Q&A show I gave an
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.280]   in-depth overview for a listener who was trying to come up with an idea of how they could connect with their audience in in a
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.640]   How they could connect with their audience and build an overall platform that would help them to make connections
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.400]   And I talked about the media strategy. I talked about things. I regret personally with regard to
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.440]   Radical personal finance things I would do differently, but basically going forward if I were starting over again today going forward
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   I would not focus on just one medium
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.640]   I would start with one and I would try to start with where I'm best but going forward
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   I think it's best to focus on
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.960]   multiple media that's obviously more difficult because
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.280]   It's hard to do all things
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.520]   well
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.120]   and the skills you need to be a good writer are not necessarily the skills that you need to be a good podcaster and the
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.680]   Skills that need to be a good podcaster are definitely not the skills that you need to be a good video broadcaster
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.680]   They're both they're they're all very different. And so what you've got to do is you've got to develop the ability to
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.640]   work in the different media
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.200]   podcasts are
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.160]   Really good for building a close relationship with your listeners
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.280]   They're really hard to get found
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.280]   They're really hard for people to share them
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   Because basically either you are a podcast listener or you're not a podcast listener
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.240]   And so people don't usually do a very good job of actually sharing whole episodes
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.040]   So if I were gonna do one or the other I wouldn't writing certainly is gonna be good
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   The benefits of writing is much more shareable
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.080]   It's much more findable. The SEO is gonna be a lot better people can connect with the content
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.320]   They can look through it very quickly, which is gonna help you to attract a broader audience. So
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.880]   The podcast will go deeper, but I wouldn't just do one. I would do all of the above
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.720]   That's I think where we stand in May of 2020 is it's not sufficient to just do one thing
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.520]   You've got to do all of the above because that meets people in different places
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.880]   So to the extent that you're able I would choose where you want to start
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.680]   But my long-term plan would be to expand into all the different platforms and the different formats
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.800]   Okay, that's helpful
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:03.600]   Go back and listen to last week's Friday Q&A and I cover it in depth on that Friday Q&A of a lot of details
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   of how you can
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.360]   You know build the different the different models and you can leverage what you're doing on different platforms
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   But that would be where I would sent you
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.440]   Okay, that'd be great. I will go back make sure I get to that. Thank you
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.320]   Thank you mark and good luck with the new venture again
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.240]   Mark's venture is called the prepared expat so you can find him
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.400]   I know on Twitter if you want to find him there you can find the prepared expat and find his website
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.600]   He's been writing some interesting articles there. All right, let's go to James in Massachusetts James. You're up. Welcome to the show
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.080]   Said a question about buying property at a good price. So
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.940]   My wife and I are considering buying
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:52.200]   property that we may or may want to you know, put a house on or just farm or homestead on and
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   essentially, I'm trying to think holistically like
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.080]   I've heard you say that you are considering buying property if if
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.880]   Or properties if the opportunity presents itself with downturn with distressed properties and good prices
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.560]   What's your strategy for keeping an eye open? Are you looking for private sales? Are you looking at any specific?
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.760]   listing
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:22.120]   Companies or how do you even think about like trying to be ready for when the opportunity comes?
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.040]   And how do you even know when the opportunity comes? What kind of property are you interested in investing in?
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.760]   So
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.880]   We're mostly interested in buying
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.720]   Either a house on a little bit more acreage than we have now or just some acreage
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.480]   Do you have a specific geographic location chosen that you'd like to pursue
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.640]   New England. Okay, that's pretty broad anything more specific. Ah
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.280]   New Hampshire
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:00.640]   Okay. So I think the answer to your question of where to look is going to depend on
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.520]   What type of property you're dealing with?
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.240]   So for me if I'm interested in buying rental real estate
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:14.660]   My plan in buying that rental real estate is going to be to focus on the type of neighborhood that I want to buy
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.160]   the city that I want to buy in and the region that I want to buy in and so
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:28.160]   If you I'm laughing because as I'm recording this I've got Facebook comments coming in about my murdery eyes there was a
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.080]   listener
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.620]   There was a listener in the the Facebook group this last week that says I like Joshua's new video
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.120]   Feed but I can't handle it because evidently Joshua has murdery eyes
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.520]   Slightly murdery eyes, so I'll zoom in so you can see my my slightly murdery eyes
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:52.400]   Forgive me back to property. I'm still learning how to juggle all of these all of these interesting aspects
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.480]   So for me, my my plan is to buy
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.200]   single-family rental houses in specific cities region and towns
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.880]   And so I have a certain neighborhood type that I personally am looking for my neighborhood type
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.320]   What I've chosen is the best type of of property for me is to focus on
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.480]   Owners neighborhoods where there's more owners than renters on kind of older but not too old
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.900]   Properties kind of the night in South Florida the 1980s kind of style of construction
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.400]   1980s 1990s and to find houses where there's no HOA
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.220]   Where you have three bedroom two bath two houses two car garage kind of just that middle
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.560]   Slightly under slightly over the middle range of property
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.440]   So there aren't a ton of neighborhoods that fit those markets
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.560]   So what I've done is I've identified the neighborhood and they just simply gotten on an MLS list
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.080]   So I can keep an eye on the MLS listings for those neighborhoods
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.240]   And then what I have done in the past is gone out walk the neighborhoods
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.840]   You can go walk the neighborhoods knock on doors find out if there's you know
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.160]   Anything for sale talk to the neighbors things like that
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.240]   But that's a very specific strategy based upon the kind of thing that you're looking for
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.640]   Now if you're looking for farmland and you say I'd like raw land
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.400]   That's maybe 50 to 100 acres. That's gonna be a totally different scenario in that case. I'd be on land watch
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.480]   I'd be driving around in the counties talking to people getting on some real estate agent lists
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.240]   Basically doing anything you can think of that's gonna lead to that property eventually coming to you
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:39.420]   But there's a dramatic difference between finding a single-family house between finding a condo for sale between finding
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.320]   You know a bunch of land and what I would say is the first thing you should do is
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.680]   Work out your strategy of what you want to do and then if necessary
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.000]   Talk to some real estate agents and say listen if you were looking for this kind of property, how would you find it?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.520]   What list would you get on where would you look for it and then follow their advice for your local network network?
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   That's what I would do
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   Okay, cool, that's more or less what I was expecting I didn't know if there were any like
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.960]   Special sort of like hand-to-hand techniques that you would recommend
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.840]   But that I think going into the communities that I'm interested in and narrowing down makes a lot of sense
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.600]   So, all right. Thanks a lot. Yeah, my pleasure. I do think what you should do for whatever your
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.520]   Chosen area of focus is is look at the information that's publicly available
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.840]   Look for the properties that are listed on the MLS
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.920]   Look for the properties that are listed on land watch or on the internet on some random site
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.360]   But I think it's also worth it to go and get involved in the community and try to find you know
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:49.340]   Put shoe leather on sidewalk put rubber under the tires or I guess road under the rubber whatever
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:57.760]   Idiom we want to come up with but the idea is your best deals are probably not going to be advertised
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.080]   sometimes they are but
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.160]   most real estate investors have developed their own source of
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:12.520]   High quality property and they've figured out a way to gain access to that property before there's a lot of competition
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:19.680]   So to this day, there are lots of people who go out and knock on doors and it really is an effective technique
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.760]   So if there's knocking on doors if it's going to local
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.840]   Auctions if it's going to the sale barn if and talking to farmers and saying do you know anybody who's selling their property?
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.720]   All of those would be good strategies
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.360]   But but you do want to use the lists, but you want to find the properties that aren't on the list as well
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.560]   We go to Daniel Daniel. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.080]   Well, Joshua, can you hear me? Yes, sounds good, sir
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   All right, so my question is concerning my parents right now they're in the early 50s
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.960]   Combined they earn
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.720]   More than 150 K a year
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:08.320]   They have one apartment in Eastern Europe and also one piece of land that's been laying vacant for over a decade
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.280]   So it's not for living it's for I guess
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.840]   Vacation homes, but they can't do anything with it at the moment
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.520]   and
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.800]   My question is basically they're not really financially
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.480]   educated they come from a
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.760]   Like communist background and the attitude is basically well, the money is here right now. That's good and
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.440]   We give we give handouts to the family back home even
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.520]   Even if the relatives have like failing businesses for years and the money is never coming back
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.800]   so they're quite generous in that way, but
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.600]   I'm just afraid they're not
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.520]   taking care of
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   their next
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.320]   10 20 years where they could like right now. They're in the best position. They're earning well
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.000]   But
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.920]   How should I approach that what I did so far is over like half a year
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.120]   I got them to go to a wealth center and make an appointment. They got some tips how to
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.320]   optimize their taxes and so on
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.440]   But I know that they could do much more
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.360]   But since it's coming from me like the Sun
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.200]   I can tell them really how to do I can just tell them hey
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.880]   Look into it
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.840]   There is much you can optimize because things are not going to stay the same and you are not going to earn
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.880]   This much money in a couple years. So now you have the chance to set yourself up
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.720]   for retirement and I'm not too sure
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.400]   in 10 years the world is going to be as rosy as it is right now and
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.440]   Maybe they expected I'm gonna be
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:59.600]   Like handing out things as well in 10 years. So this is kind of the situation. I don't know if that's enough for you
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.280]   to
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:08.720]   Make some comments or should I ask anymore? Do they have any kind of retirement plan a government pension a pension from their job?
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   Not from the job but from the government, yes, do you have reason to think that that would be insufficient for them
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.880]   Yes, I'm just not trusting in that right yes
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.960]   How much money do you think they could save out of their income based upon their current lifestyle?
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:40.040]   From what I heard they could save my dad's salary which is more than 10k a month
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.520]   That's a lot. It could do that. They could they could do that
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.480]   They could live off the salary of my mom, which is half of that or less than half. All right
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   But they're not doing it what are they doing with the money instead
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.640]   Just
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.960]   You know handouts or just putting it in the bank or
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:17.080]   Spending in the restaurants, they're not spending much. So they're thrifty and looking for cheap deals still like they did 15 20 years ago
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.640]   But there back then they
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.320]   were keeping book of everything they spent and
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:31.720]   Since they were earning much more they didn't do that anymore because well the money's here. So now we can just do whatever
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.280]   Well when you have somebody in a situation I think of it in a number of different different approaches so throughout human history
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.040]   What's the most common way that people have?
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:52.320]   Retired the most common way that people have retired throughout human history has always been based upon people. It's been based upon
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.160]   Living with your children. It's been based upon living with somebody in the community
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.440]   And so just because your parents are not skilled at saving money doesn't mean that they're destitute
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:08.200]   It doesn't mean that they are without options if they're building relationships in the community. They have friends
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.440]   They have a network of family
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.360]   That's been throughout the millennia the primary solution that most people have relied on for their retirement needs
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.720]   Now the second thing is they do have a government pension or a an employer pension or a government pension
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.760]   And so that's good because it gives them some basic level of support all around the world
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.640]   There are millions of people who without the government pension Social Security in the United States
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   Whatever the version is within your local country
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.680]   Without that they would have no savings because they fundamentally not been trained to save money
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.240]   and so they're probably gonna be okay between their government pension and also you and
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.120]   Possibly other siblings that you might have you wouldn't let your parents, you know go homeless and starve on the street
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.600]   What you do see however is an opportunity that if they could learn some skills of financial management
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.280]   They could dramatically increase their opportunities
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.760]   They have the ability to save ten thousand dollars a month and with this ability to save ten thousand dollars a month
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   They could become very very wealthy. So I would do a few things
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.760]   I think that that there are a number of things that you could do and
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   To begin with what I would try to focus on is I would try to lay out for them
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.600]   What they could do and how they could genuinely
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.000]   massively increase their possibilities of
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.520]   Wealth if they actually invest it, so let's just assume that they're in their early 50s
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.200]   Let's just say 50 for the sake of easy math. Let's say they have 15 years of
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.720]   retirement and
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.840]   there could they could save ten thousand dollars of
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.080]   Pay did you say per month or per year?
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   If they wanted to they could do it per month, okay, so what I would focus on
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.480]   Go ahead
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.440]   If they didn't didn't want to cut too dramatically
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:13.000]   5k is reasonable. Let's say between 5 and 10. Okay, so let's say 5,000 because it's a little bit more
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.720]   Believable probably for them. So I would sit down and
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.360]   Running on a financial calculator right now five thousand dollars per month. So we do five thousand dollars
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   per month 15 years and let's just say that they could earn, you know, six percent interest
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   Starting with nothing at the end of 15 years if they could save five thousand dollars per month
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:43.040]   They could potentially have one million four hundred fifty four thousand dollars saved almost one and a half million dollars at six percent
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:49.520]   So to me, I would sit down with them and start by saying listen mom and dad
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.200]   I know that you grew up under communism. I know that you didn't start by focusing on
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.880]   money and investment, but there's tremendous opportunity here and yeah, you think that
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.840]   You couldn't build wealth
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.640]   But if you could save five thousand dollars per month and if you could invest it at six percent over the next 15 years
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.160]   You could become genuinely wealthy within the next 15 years
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.920]   You could become genuinely wealthy within that period of time, which would be really really remarkable
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.800]   So I would start by that and see if they're interested now
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:28.480]   What I think you need to be cautious of with someone like that is by making sure they choose an investment
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.520]   plan or an investment product that's going to be a good fit for them and
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.960]   Those of us who are more knowledge about investing often go to the products that we would choose
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.000]   Without realizing that these products or these plans are probably not right for them
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   So for example, we'll often go to an aggressive stock portfolio and a lot of times when you're in a situation
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.680]   Like that for for your parents, they just they couldn't handle the volatility
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.240]   And so maybe you would go into some kind of term deposit and just get them invested into bank accounts
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.800]   Maybe you would go into some kind of bond portfolio what I would try to do
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.960]   Especially since they already know own some property
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.360]   I would try to get them to buy some more real estate if they bought a couple of simple flats in the middle of town
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.880]   In a good area in the town that they live. There's a decent chance that in most places in the world
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.160]   That's probably not a losing investment
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.720]   That's probably a place where they could break even and in time if they choose well and you guide them towards maybe like a city center
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.200]   apartment that could be the kind of
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.360]   investment that could pay income and the nice thing about real estate is
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.960]   It's it's more intuitive. I think for most investors where they don't have to worry about, you know
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.600]   Figuring out how to hold on through the difficult times
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   They just spend the rent payments and so at five thousand dollars per month if they could say five to ten thousand dollars per month
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.440]   They could probably just pay cash for an apartment every you know year two years
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.880]   Depending on what market in Eastern Europe they're in or where you're living
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.760]   And I think that would be really appropriate. So I would probably try to go in that direction
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.520]   I would say mom dad look if you were to buy four or five apartments in
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.920]   You know the downtown area or help them choose a good neighborhood where they already live
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:21.840]   Figure out the prices of those apartments and then lay it out and show them if you could buy one apartment every other year and that
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   apartment pays us maybe
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.340]   $800 a month or $1,000 a month or 15 whatever your market is
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.600]   That's a really good strong financial plan and they have enough money that they could do it
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.440]   So that's where I would go is I would try to keep it super simple save money in the bank buy paid-off apartments
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.640]   Something like that
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.560]   Okay, one thing that the apartment they bought they bought it for
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:52.240]   When they would go back to visit the family and I told him for like five years. Why don't you rent it out?
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.480]   It's not like 98% of the year. It's it's standing empty and
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.400]   The
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.080]   Aunt is living in the same house
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.360]   so she could take care of people going in or out or whatever if it's Airbnb, but
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.840]   They decided not to rent it out. So that's one thing that this like
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.160]   This left to understand that that's the one thing and the other
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.040]   That you talked about about choosing the right investment
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.720]   Maybe you could answer this as well
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.260]   Like they're Christian and my mom always says
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:34.700]   Making money with money is unethical. It's like usually it's against against the commandments and stuff like that
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:42.320]   I don't know if she really believes that or she just says that to not do the hard work of researching financial stuff
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   But these are like also some mental blocks that they have against these things. So maybe you're taking that
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.160]   Do they invest in anything?
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.560]   They
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   Invested in some
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.000]   Stocks at the peak of the tech bubble
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.880]   and
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.840]   That's break-even after 20 years
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   So it was down for like two decades and they always joke about that a little bit, but it was not much
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.320]   he was not much and
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.440]   My dad chose some
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.800]   single biotech stocks
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.360]   But
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.000]   That's just random stuff. So they don't really know what they're doing
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And they burnt their fingers a couple times. So they're not really doing anything
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.720]   Yeah, that's fairly common with people who are not particularly
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.200]   experienced with
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:49.320]   Stock investing. What is the Christian tradition that they're a part of is there a denomination? Is there a tradition name of a church?
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.360]   Roman Catholic, okay Roman Catholic
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   So
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.680]   There are that's probably a bigger question than we can tackle here because
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.640]   There are definitely
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.800]   religious
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   Convictions that are going to affect somebody and you've got to
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:19.760]   Work within that now. There are almost two ways of working with that. The first way is you can say
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.080]   you have this conviction and
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.080]   It's wrong, right?
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.960]   So maybe if I had a different conviction and I'm sitting and talking with somebody and they say I'm Roman Catholic
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.600]   This is what I believe. This is what I believe the Bible teaches and I'm gonna I'm willing to use
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.280]   The authority of Scripture. Well, then I would go to Scripture and start talking through that of course
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.400]   Roman Catholic there would be the authority of Scripture and also the authority of
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:54.320]   The church tradition and the church teaching and so we would talk through that and and discuss it from a theological perspective and try to understand
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:02.840]   If there were a way that they could change their theology, maybe it's possible. Maybe it's not I have friends of mine who are
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:09.880]   Very fundamentalist and when for example, Jesus says do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.140]   They understand that to be a wooden Lee literal
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:21.260]   Fundamentalist command of Jesus and they are very diligent about not laying up for themselves treasures on earth
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.640]   They don't save money. They don't try to stack up wealth. I
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.520]   Respect that, you know, and so I don't try to change them
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.400]   I try to create a financial plan within that context and there you often go back to
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.280]   community the power of community because
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:44.480]   In those kinds of traditions what you have is you have a community that works together to support one another
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:51.600]   So it's not that people who understand that to be the the proper interpretation of the words of Christ
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.920]   It's not as though they just go and spend all their money
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   What they do is they invest into the community and the community cares one for another and so there are ways to do it
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.080]   So that's the second way is that let's say that I'm not gonna change their theology
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.480]   I'm not gonna persuade them that you're wrong and I'm right or you just have a flawed understanding
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.320]   I would just try to understand the extent of what do you understand?
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.880]   The restrictions to be there's not a strong
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:26.320]   There's no that I'm aware of there's no official Roman Catholic teaching against investing. Okay now there are
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.560]   That's what it seems that they just use it as an excuse
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.080]   Not to look into it that that's my understanding of it. They're not really saying well
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.480]   This is a part of the scripture that tells it they're not praying every day
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.400]   So they just go to church once a week so that I think they're pretty educated
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.920]   And they would respond well if somebody laid out to them the numbers and all of that
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:58.800]   So I think that approach would work. Yeah, what I would do is I would try to find are you Roman Catholic yourself?
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.000]   Do you share that tradition? I grew I grew up like that, but it's more like a cultural thing
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.040]   I am another fundamentalist. Okay, so what I would do is I would try to find some Roman Catholic
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.560]   You know
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.760]   oriented
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.280]   Resources if somebody hasn't created it
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.880]   then I'm sure I have a listener that can and should but I'm sure somebody out there is
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.760]   Teaching about finance from a Roman Catholic perspective
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.400]   Who understands I'm not an expert on Roman Catholicism
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.520]   I'm not Roman Catholic and so but I'm sure there is somebody out there who's done that
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.840]   There are many Roman Catholic writers who would have written books on money
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.640]   and so I would try to find that understand a little bit about where they're coming from and then work within the constraints of their
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:51.320]   Doctrinal commitments, that's what I would do. But there's no that I'm aware of there's no
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.120]   strong Roman Catholic tradition or
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.920]   prohibition against
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.960]   Lending money the the comments on usury you can go back and and and look at it
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:09.320]   And and think about it, but I think probably there Gary North would be the best guy read his commentaries on usury
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:17.840]   If somebody is actually interested in the biblical approach and in dealing with the Old Testament laws on usury
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.040]   Gary North's
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.960]   Writings there would probably the best place to start
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.800]   But I would just try to understand what their constraints are and then try to build a financial plan that is sensitive to those constraints
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.400]   That may be term deposits in the bank
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.160]   For some people it may be just investing in other people and I think that that's a worthy thing to do
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.620]   I think there are a lot of 50 year olds that if a financial planner came to them and said
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:48.440]   What we're gonna do with your money is we're gonna use it and we're gonna open an orphanage and we're gonna invest your money
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.320]   into the orphanage and
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.840]   build a
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.400]   System of caring for the children who are fatherless here in our city
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.920]   as far as I'm concerned, that's a great retirement plan and
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.720]   The children in the community would be happy to provide for them on the other end of the day
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.640]   So those are my answers anything else Daniel?
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:15.280]   Yeah, I think that's a that's good, thank you very much thanks for the work you do my pleasure
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   I appreciate it. All right, we go to
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.320]   Jason and Texas Jason. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:28.920]   My pleasure
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.120]   A quick question. I don't know if you've done a podcast
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:39.000]   Children's insurance or adding a rider to your current insurance for a newborn
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:48.240]   But we're expecting at first this fall and just wondering if you could expand on kind of your thoughts on
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.080]   Child insurance and what's he there?
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:57.120]   I've covered it in the context of Q&A shows here and there. I'll do it briefly. I intend
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:04.320]   As soon as I can I intend to come out with a standalone course where I can teach through some of the details
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.540]   But I'll go ahead and give you a short answer here and I'm gonna mute you out Jason for a minute
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:17.160]   Just to keep the audio clear. So when it comes to children's life insurance, there are a few different reasons as to why
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:22.680]   People would want it. The first reason that some people think about is burial cost
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.800]   So I have a child the child dies and I need to provide for them. Well, I need money
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.920]   to be able to pay for a funeral to buy a casket and to go ahead and
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:40.360]   Pay for those costs. That's one thing another aspect would be maybe things like recognizing that I've
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.280]   You know, there would be hard for me to go to work
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.720]   If one of my children died, it's hard for me to imagine that I'd be here on the microphone the next day
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.020]   so maybe a time of
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:56.960]   Emotional adjustment for the family. There are other things that you can consider. So for example
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:04.280]   Some people would say if a child died then my financial expenses are based upon the investments
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.240]   That I have made into those children if I bought I paid for their early child education
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.660]   I've invested in their schooling. I've paid for private school for 12 years of private school and then I paid for college
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:23.280]   It wouldn't be unusual for a parent to have invested six figures or multiple six figures into their children
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.900]   And then all of a sudden that child dies. Well, that's a real loss
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:32.720]   Certainly an emotional loss, but there's also a real financial loss that's associated with that
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.440]   And so people might say I've lost the money. I need to be recouped for some of that
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:45.120]   in many cultures around the world children are a primary as we were talking about earlier children are a primary form of a retirement plan a
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:52.800]   Security plan for the parents you'll see this if you're coming from the United States where you most often see this is in Indian communities
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.080]   In the United States where it's like the mom and dad will pour out everything for their children
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.480]   They'll pay for everything get their parents their children to the best schools possible and then on the flip side
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.920]   They're expecting that their children will support them as they get older also very common in Latin communities
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:15.240]   So all of these have a financial cost that's associated with it that you're actually talking about the money
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:21.440]   Involved and so that's the first step of insurance now when it comes to these
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Almost nobody is really comfortable
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.280]   Dealing with some of these costs most people it's such an emotionally heavy issue that they think if my child died. I
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.440]   Appreciate that that might be important, but I'm not going to to want to profit off of that
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.320]   I'm not so bothered by the emotion of it. I don't have any emotional, you know fear of death
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.160]   It's a fact of life and I think it's important to point some of these things out now the burial cost to me seems not
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:55.920]   Particularly important at least for most of my clients and most of my listeners
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.440]   You know, it's not that much to bury somebody
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.000]   It costs a few thousand dollars to bury somebody and you can save the money so you can easily
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.760]   Self-insure through that an emotional adjustment same exact thing you can
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.520]   Self-insure it's not hard to self-insure through that as well
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.440]   if you have a three month emergency fund if you have a six month emergency fund and you can't work for a few months because
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.640]   You're grieving the loss of your child. Well, you can self-insure through that as well
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.080]   The financial investment side of it certainly is kind of more relevant
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:33.200]   I I think it's worth thinking about but I've almost never met a parent who is excited about talking to me about you know
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:40.480]   Recouping the financial investment on their child. So you there is it is valuable to have insurance on the child for those reasons
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:47.380]   But most people genuinely can self-insure. It's not that big of a of a financial commitment
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.800]   So insurance is not always the perfect fit for it. It's one of those optional fits
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.160]   And so the other thing is what about insurance for the benefit of the child?
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.880]   So do you want insurance for the child?
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.480]   So that in the future in case something happens with the child that they can
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.120]   That they can adjust that they can own their own insurance policy. Maybe they start working as a
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.060]   Excuse me, maybe they start working as a professional
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.380]   You know stunt pilot in their middle 20s. Well, they're gonna have a hard time getting life insurance
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.440]   So you need life insurance for that?
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:29.660]   Well when you start to do this analysis what you'll find is that different types of insurance policies are appropriate in different solutions
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:36.000]   So term life insurance if it were available would cover the burial cost term life insurance
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.880]   If it's available covers emotional adjustment and term life insurance if available covers the financial investment
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.560]   The problem is you can't buy term insurance
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.940]   You can't buy term for those who are less than 18 years old
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.580]   So I do think that term insurance makes a lot of sense
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.220]   If you have a child that you're sending off to college when I used to sell life insurance
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.260]   I had a couple of clients who they would be sending their child off to school
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.260]   they knew where they were getting set up for a
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.780]   $150,000 of cost or possibly in some cases
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:11.980]   $150,000 of debt and one of the things that we would do is we would buy a couple hundred thousand dollar term life insurance policy
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.620]   On the child when the child is getting ready to go off to school
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:19.700]   But the child has to be at least 18 years old if you want term life insurance for children
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:26.280]   Under 18, it's generally only available as a rider on another policy
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.260]   So this might be a group policy at your job where you can go into your job and you can add
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.340]   $5,000 or $10,000 of coverage there
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:40.680]   Sometimes it can be available as a rider on an individual term life insurance policy or as a rider if you have like all your
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.340]   auto insurance and home insurance and a little bit term life insurance with
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:50.740]   With a company sometimes they'll offer those kinds of riders, but it's not common when you get into real term life insurance
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.120]   If you got a two million dollar term life insurance policy with Guardian, they're not going to give you a term life insurance policy
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:02.740]   It just don't they don't write them for children under the age of 18 now when you get to insurance for the child
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:10.560]   That's when you move over into the world of whole life insurance and whole life insurance can also cover some of those same
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:16.460]   Those same needs so you can do whole life and use whole life insurance for the burial
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:20.660]   You can use whole life insurance for the emotional adjustment
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:26.260]   what you often can't use whole life insurance for because just too expensive is if you're gonna buy a lot of it for a
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:33.980]   Lot of it for the child. So what I recommend just to cut right to the actual recommendations for the vast majority of families
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.520]   What I recommend is if you have access to a term life insurance policy
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.020]   Then go ahead and put a rider on it. If they'll give you a rider then add a rider
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.020]   Rider is so cheap
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.100]   It's just not going to be a problem and that will cover the needs that you have
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.220]   For the burial fund and an emotional adjustment fund
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:40:00.300]   There's no reason not to go ahead and have a rider if you do need something where you're trying to have something more
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.760]   Permanent you're gonna wind up buying some kind of whole life insurance policy
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.060]   And I really do like as long as you have other savings other investments as well
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:17.020]   Where you're you're actually you're not just saying this is gonna be my ticket to wealth because it's not whole life insurance policies for children
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:23.140]   Do not perform well for cash value for the first 20 years. It's brutal in terms of the actual cash value
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:28.660]   They're much more they perform much worse than whole life insurance policies for adults do from the cash value perspective
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.900]   But what I do is for all of my children when they're two weeks old and I can get a policy
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.980]   I buy a small whole life insurance policy for them and
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.280]   What I do is I buy something, you know
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.320]   You can the the figures can vary if you have a million dollars of life insurance on you
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.780]   Then you might get you know
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:51.320]   25k on the child on each of your children if you've got millions of dollars and you have a lot of income
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.080]   You know, you might get 100k something like that for each for your for your children
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.320]   But with those I buy traditional whole life insurance
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:05.640]   So it'll be in force forever. And what I do is I make sure that I add two important
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.100]   benefits to that policy
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:15.820]   The first benefit is an APB which is called an additional purchase benefit and what an additional purchase benefit allows is
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.780]   It allows the insured to buy more insurance at a certain age
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:25.780]   So for example with my children's policies at the age of 20 at the age of 23 26 29
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.540]   32 35
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:35.380]   38 and 41 they can buy additional amounts of insurance and I think I've got a hundred thousand dollars either a hundred thousand or a
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.780]   Hundred and fifty thousand dollar APB on those policies
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.180]   So that means that if my child turns 20 and maybe my child has some kind of disease
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.660]   That they can't get any life insurance. They could buy another hundred thousand dollars of whole life insurance
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:53.220]   It'll be expensive because it's whole life insurance, but it's better than nothing if they've developed some kind of disease more likely
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.420]   They may have started doing something that's risky
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.380]   So for example, I got a family member who's a pilot and started flying as a private pilot and became professional pilot
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.060]   That kind of thing gets you some big ratings a lot of times on life insurance
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.400]   And so the nice thing is that with an additional purchase benefit in this kind of insurance setup
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:14.180]   Then your child is protected where they always have the ability to buy more amounts of life insurance
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.740]   Caveat it is going to be whole life insurance
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.540]   You can't do this with term life insurance
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:24.280]   But that can still be work out really well for them to at least have some life insurance coverage
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.980]   the other thing that I always put on the policies is a
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.620]   disability waiver of premium and so what that means is if the child is
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.540]   disabled then
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.160]   You don't have to pay the premiums for them
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.980]   And so that's a big big deal because there are certain kinds of presumptive
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.900]   Disabilities that the child can get and if they're disabled you don't have to pay the premiums
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:51.420]   But with the premier companies the premium companies if the child is disabled
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:57.780]   They'll actually keep on there the additional purchase benefit and they'll let the child buy the bail pay for the additional purchase benefits when they come
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:03.980]   Available to them and so what I do is split the difference on these and I buy whole life insurance policies
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.100]   Relatively small for each of my children
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:12.740]   So that they have some insurance if they die. I've got some money to cover burial costs, etc
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:18.020]   I've got some cash value, but the cash value returns are really bad on these kinds of policies
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.660]   basically if it breaks even
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.700]   That's good in terms of over the course of 20 years something like that
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:29.460]   But they'll always have some insurance that's in force and with the additional purchase benefit
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.860]   I feel like that's a really huge benefit and help because it
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:41.380]   Allows me or my children to buy more insurance in the future. So that's kind of the the fast lesson on it Jason
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:48.820]   Nope hold on this Jason I unmuted the wrong person any follow-up questions Jason
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.820]   Oh
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   One last one as far as
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.660]   life insurance on myself
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.700]   My wife will be quitting her job once we have kids
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:04.560]   And we'll have a household income about 100 K. I currently have 250
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:10.180]   On myself and 250 on my wife. Would you recommend upping that once we have a kid?
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.860]   Do you are you financially independent? Do you have millions of dollars in savings?
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.980]   No, okay. So yes
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:25.180]   You can do a needs analysis and that's the proper way to do it you calculate how much money you would need if
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.860]   you
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:33.500]   Died how much debt you would want to pay off how much income your family would need and then you subtract all your assets that are
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.980]   Available. So the proper way to do it is to perform a proper needs analysis
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.940]   And this is life insurance 101 talk to any life insurance agent. They can do that for you
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:47.940]   What you will find out is it's gonna be somewhere between 10 to 20 times your annual income
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.860]   That's always where it is
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.720]   If you actually sit down with a hundred people with 98 of them
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.540]   It'll be somewhere between 10 to 20 times your life and you sorry your annual income
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:04.220]   so you'll be at somewhere between a million to two million dollars of total coverage for you and
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:10.820]   I would buy if your wife is going to be a stay-at-home mom. I would buy minimum half of that for her
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.460]   I would buy more if she's still working and she can qualify
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:20.900]   She won't be able to qualify as a stay-at-home mom for the same amount that you can qualify for
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:27.860]   So what you want to do is at an early age while she's still working and can financially qualify for more insurance
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.580]   Go ahead and get more
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.180]   so
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:35.860]   you know where you're gonna wind up when you do that needs analysis with an insurance agent is you're gonna wind up doing a
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   million and a half on you and
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:43.540]   750 or a million on her but the great thing is if you guys are relatively young non-smokers
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:48.700]   This is a total net cost with you know for you to have a million and a half is probably forty dollars a month for
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.860]   term life insurance and for her to have
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:56.180]   750 is probably you know thirty dollars a month and by I'm not gonna explain it right now
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.140]   But by a type of life insurance called annual
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:07.600]   Renewable term life insurance do not buy level term life insurance when you're under the age of about 45
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:14.700]   So if you're in your 30s by annual renewable term life insurance and you can go and investigate that elsewhere
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:24.000]   My pleasure, all right, that was Jason I've got too many colors here. Let's go to
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.360]   The Florida Keys welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:35.280]   Hey, good morning, Joshua John here. I'm gonna stick with the theme of this episode. It seems like real estate. I got a
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.620]   Decision to make and was looking for your insight. Okay
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:47.060]   So I'm currently active-duty military and I just received what will be my final set of orders
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:52.340]   Taking me back to New Orleans, Louisiana where I intend to retire
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.600]   I was there previously during my career and I already have
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.720]   one riddle rental property there in
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.840]   Louisiana so the decision is is now we're looking at
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.760]   The orders are three-year orders, but we know this is our long-term
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.720]   desired location to stay at
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.000]   So do we buy another three two for a second rental property?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.480]   Or do we go and look to make the decision to buy that longer five to ten year?
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.140]   Forever home so to speak do you have children?
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:32.200]   One children one child and one on the way, okay, how old is your child that you have?
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.700]   She's three. Yeah, I
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.780]   Would buy a rental first I would buy a house
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   That's a good rental with a three-year-old
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:46.620]   The good thing is she's kind of right at that cusp where you're gonna start to appreciate some of the amenities
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:53.060]   but I would I would buy the rental first and maybe even two over the next three years and
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.220]   Then and live in them, you know while you
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:03.100]   While you're while you're there live in them and then rent them out do the the nomad investing strategy read James Orr's book
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.480]   And kind of let that be your inspiration
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:11.120]   But I would do yeah, I would do the rentals first and then you know, if you have another child
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.400]   If you move into kind of the long-term
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.480]   House when you have a seven year old and a four year old that would be really ideal
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.000]   I would I would go ahead and build that rental property portfolio first and then
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.820]   Have that ticking away there before I move to the forever home because you guys are used to moving
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.120]   You know, you've got to move. You've got a three-year-old doesn't need that much space
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.000]   You're gonna have a baby doesn't need that much space if you'll stretch it out for another three years
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.280]   Purchase one or two rentals in the interim then you'll be much on a much higher
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:53.200]   Financial independence trajectory than you would be if you go ahead and move to the big house you get comfortable you start
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:00.120]   You know settling in doing that nesting thing defer it just a little bit till you have more houses and then go ahead and make
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   That lifestyle upgrade. That's what I would do
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.520]   Sounds
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.540]   Sounds what we were thinking about doing and I appreciate your insight there Joshua
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:15.680]   Yeah, I think it's important to acknowledge that you don't want to live like a pauper forever. Your goal is not to
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.920]   Kind of always be stuck in this place where we're just gonna move and it's money money money money
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:26.320]   It's nice to set up that home base that nest that forever home
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.160]   Your wife is gonna be thrilled when you're done with the military
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.200]   She doesn't have to be a worry about moving too much two years from now
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.040]   But it's a lot nicer to do that if you've got a good solid financial base
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:46.520]   And so I would definitely just defer it a little tiny longer and you'll get more benefits out of it
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:51.360]   When you are settled what book I'd recommend if you haven't read it
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:58.320]   It's available free online, but search for James or and it's called Nomad real estate
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.880]   investing and
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.520]   He has that book available online for free
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.560]   but it's basically the strategy of buy a house move into it live there for a year or so and
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.720]   Then move out and do it again and you can do this with your VA loans
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.960]   There's a little bit of trickiness with regard to the technicalities of how many VA loans you're supposed to have you can investigate that
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.280]   But there are a lot of people who have used the VA loans
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:28.480]   purchased a large rental state port portfolio of multiple properties and it seems that
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.120]   It's something that they've been able to do. So that would be my approach
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.400]   All right. Let's go to
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.000]   Charleston, South Carolina. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.880]   Hey Josh, my name is Steven. I was just tolerant actually on a
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:48.400]   Somewhat similar topic. I'm 27 years old got two kids and a wife and we live in Tennessee actually
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.480]   Okay, I'm joining the military in September as an officer and that will
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.560]   produce a significant increase in salary just because uh
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.760]   I've been I'm only just now getting into being physically
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.040]   physically
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.040]   responsible with my personal finances
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.520]   We have four goals to pay off student loans
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:13.300]   Adopt a child buy real estate back in Tennessee for when we get out of the military and begin savings
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.040]   how do I do you have any resources you would recommend for how I
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   strategize accomplishing those goals
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:25.480]   Considering I'm gonna see a pay increase, but I also I'm just trying to figure out how to how to maneuver on that
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.200]   So well, the first thing I would do is save money. It's never a wrong thing to save money
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:36.320]   So that would be priority number one. I would live on the minimum that is
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:43.360]   Comfortable for your family and save the maximum amount of money now with regard to student loans
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   I would think carefully through my overall strategy. Am I gonna pay them off?
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:54.600]   and is that gonna help me or is it more strategic for me to keep them and
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.760]   Invest the money as well. Should I pay off the debt or should I invest?
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:04.360]   I've got an entire episode on that just go back in the archives of radical personal finance and you'll find that episode and
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:11.480]   You can you can think through that but I would especially in an environment like now where they'll give you deferrals
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.520]   They'll freeze the interest etc. I would build up a big
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:22.080]   savings account and if you're gonna move in the direction of buying real estate then
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.520]   You know, I would
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:30.160]   This is probably going to be a good time to buy now with regard to having a child
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:37.720]   I would say this is time dependent not money dependent. So sorry with adopting a child so I
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:43.960]   Would not wait on the money to adopt a child if I knew I wanted to have a child
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:50.480]   We would adopt a child when the child is available when we see the opportunity and we say
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.160]   This is the child that we want to adopt. I would do it
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:57.000]   I think it's although I appreciate that it seems
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.060]   Sensible to try to wait on big life decisions until you've got the money thing all figured out
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.960]   You know, there's people who especially in the the fire community
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.520]   It's all about I'm gonna be financially independent by the time. I'm 30 and have children. I
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.640]   personally have come to the conclusion that
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:20.960]   Those things are life decisions that are more important than money. Do you need to be able to afford it?
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.280]   Yes, but a lot of times, you know
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.120]   If I didn't have the money and I felt the desire to adopt a child
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:33.440]   I would pursue the adoption and wait for the money to show up. Maybe I worked it. Maybe I did a deal
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.680]   Maybe friends and family donated money. Maybe I was able to find some discounts
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.760]   I just would not wait on money to get married would not wait on money to have children
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.800]   I would make those decisions because I felt the time was right and then I would make the money
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.260]   make sense over time so in my
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.120]   My order would be savings
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.720]   Because you can do that now
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:05.080]   Adoption would be whenever it's appropriate number three would be real estate
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.680]   when I find the deal and
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.360]   Then number four would be student loans. And if you're gonna be
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.080]   You know aggressive
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.120]   About building a real estate portfolio
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.440]   You have to do that when the property is available and when they're a good deal
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:30.480]   Now if you can pay off the student loans quickly and be debt-free that can go now it can go after savings
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:37.160]   It can go at anywhere along the line. That's the big question mark, but I don't that's how I would order them myself
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:42.280]   Yeah, no that totally makes sense I'm tracking with you it sounds like a
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.640]   It's almost more of a what are what are my personal?
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.400]   priorities
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   rather than you know and
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.040]   Having savings helps to accomplish a lot of those so right
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:55:00.080]   Great. Well, thank you very much. Good my pleasure. All right, we're gonna go a little bit faster. I've got, Indiana
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:07.240]   Minnesota and Texas and then maybe back to Daniel. Nope, Daniel. We're done, Indiana. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:12.960]   I am a doctor looking to join a new group
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.440]   They currently offer a 401k but no match on it and I was talking to him about that
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:25.200]   They would like to offer a match to the doctors. I think it'd be too expensive to offer the match to everyone
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.840]   Is there a way to?
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:34.960]   Set up your 401k so that you can offer a match to certain positions. They're not others. No
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.160]   No, there's not. Okay
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:46.080]   Well that somebody in the Facebook group had mentioned something about setting up an affiliated services group. Is that something you're familiar with?
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   Wait, essentially get the regret
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:54.440]   the idea being of an affiliated services group the idea is
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:59.640]   that if you set up a separate company that is focused on
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:07.260]   You know that employs the doctors but then a different company that employs the staff is that the idea
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.640]   That's my understanding of it. Yes
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:15.120]   So is it technically possible? I would say most likely
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.480]   It is technically Paula possible. But the important thing is to
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:28.960]   Understand that there's still restrictions. So if you have companies that have common ownership, so let's say that I own a
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:36.360]   Company called company a and my wife and I are the sole employees of company a we pay ourselves
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:42.460]   $200,000 per year and then I also own and my wife and I own company B and in company B
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.500]   We have five low-level staff that all get paid
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.420]   $20,000 per year. Well in that situation
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.720]   we
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.720]   When we look at it in that situation
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:57:00.460]   We're not going to be able to just set up a 401k in company a but not in company B because the companies have common
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:08.340]   Ownership, so could you set up some kind of affiliated services group where there was just an employment in that separate?
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.880]   Company and there were different ownership than the low-level group
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.560]   Yes
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:21.520]   but you're gonna need to talk to a specialist who will follow the rules very carefully because the number one thing that's
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.640]   important to the government with regard to 401k plans is
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.200]   nondiscrimination they do not want
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:34.680]   401ks used to set up extra special benefits for
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.620]   high-level highly compensated employees to the
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:42.480]   detriment of the low-level staff and so that's the
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.760]   That's the doctrine that is hammered through every single part of the code in
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.080]   Every qualified plan be it a 401k or some other qualified plan
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:58:00.280]   You cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees and key key owners. So
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.940]   Is as long as you study those laws it is theoretically possible to set up multiple companies and do that
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.500]   my answer to you is it's probably not going to be worth it and
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.440]   You need to know that you better button it up
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:22.860]   exactly in the right way because if you don't you're dealing in an area that that they're very serious about and so
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:30.220]   You're gonna need professional advice. You need to make sure that you have all of the all of the T's crossed and the eyes dotted
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:32.220]   Okay
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:36.300]   Thank you that I will anything else
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:42.780]   I've got a separate question. Go ahead. It's completely unrelated if you've got time go ahead
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:49.840]   So my wife and I are expecting our first child in December
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:56.260]   you know, I've really appreciated a lot of your philosophies on child raising and you've kind of expanded a lot of
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:04.160]   You know what I think about as possible new children give me recommendations on resources for a new parent
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.160]   She read classes
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.780]   anything like that
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.300]   But you think a new parent should be looking into
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.060]   So I would say the first thing is
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:20.340]   With regard to having a new child is going to be to think about the birth of the child
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:24.140]   I've got a lot about the child, but what I'll do for the sake of
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.780]   the
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:32.480]   What I'll do for the sake of the this Q&A show is I'll focus on the birth and I'll just kind of give you my
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.580]   standard new father speech
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.220]   Hey
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:38.580]   Congratulations, you're expecting a baby now
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:45.160]   Let's talk about some things that you need to know and the things that you need to consider just purely from my experience
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:52.060]   You're a doctor. I'm not but I'll give you some things from my experience. What I would say is your first priority
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.500]   with regard to your
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.420]   with regard to your new child is
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.540]   certainly to have a
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:07.040]   Safe birth of your child, but to work with your wife with a goal of having a healthy
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.340]   enjoyable safe
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.660]   natural childbirth and
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:17.220]   That's one of the most important things that you can do for the child
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.780]   one of the most important things that you can do for your wife one of the most important things that you can do for
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.220]   Your family and there are a lot of things that you can do to work towards those goals
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   but in order for you to do them
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:34.980]   I think you're gonna have to what I've learned is you got to be a little bit countercultural because in the West we have a
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.100]   strange view of
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:43.100]   Childbirth that childbirth is somehow a medical emergency and a medical event and therefore
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.820]   We need tons and tons of medical intervention
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:50.820]   The first thing that I would do if I were you is apply your medical knowledge and study
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:56.460]   Childbirth and study kind of the different trends kind of the classic place to start
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:02.340]   Would be there's an older documentary that I forget the name of the lady that that did it
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:08.980]   But I think it's usually the place that I encourage people start the business of being born is a good documentary to start with
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.140]   There are a bunch of books that are good
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:17.380]   There's a book called the business of baby that might be interesting to you. And so you want to consider carefully
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:20.540]   the childbirth process
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:26.700]   Basically, my summary statement is childbirth does not have to be difficult childbirth does not have to be painful
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.020]   Childbirth does not have to be a horrific experience in
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:36.460]   Most women's lives there are some women who do have significant medical conditions, etc
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.300]   And so of course that's unique where you need medical intervention
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   But I'd encourage you and your wife to to really become educated and really become knowledgeable
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   About the process of childbirth so that you can understand
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:56.180]   Kind of what you want and talk to her and think about what does she want? What kind of birth?
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:03.140]   Experience does she want your three basic options that you're gonna think about is do we want a hospital birth?
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:09.140]   I would guess that that's probably almost an automatic thing for you being a physician
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.900]   But I don't think that it necessarily should be I think you should consider other options
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:19.180]   there are birth center births all around the United States and then of course you could do a home birth and
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.420]   So each of them has a different advantages and different disadvantages
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:29.980]   What I would tell you is I'm convinced personally that a lot of times having a hospital birth
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:38.900]   increases the risk of birth for the mother and the father because it takes what can be a really rich and and
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:44.940]   Wonderful experience for the mother and father and it turns it into a very medical event
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.140]   Now we chose with our first baby that we were gonna have a birth center birth
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.960]   We didn't wind up making it out of the house
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.840]   I wound up delivering the baby at home because when it was time to go the baby was already there and I've gone on and
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.580]   I've delivered all four of my babies at home with a midwife assistant now
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:08.420]   We had low low risk birth. We everything we looked great. But what we found through that experience is
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.060]   that for us our
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:17.780]   Experience and our memories of childbirth are some of the most intimate really just wonderful
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.820]   rewarding
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.620]   Experiments experiences that we ever had and
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:31.020]   We did something that I would commend to you. There are a number of different childbirth methodologies that you can look into
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.620]   We did something called hypnobirthing
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.100]   Which is weird and crunchy
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:42.380]   But we really enjoyed it in terms of and and got good results from it in terms of the childbirth and basically
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:47.420]   Hypnobirthing is all about how can you learn about childbirth to the point where you can?
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:52.140]   minimize and to some extent even eliminate the pain of childbirth and
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:57.820]   So by having a child at home or in a birth center where it's a non-medical environment
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:04.380]   What I think that has helped is it made the the entire birth experience into an intimate and enjoyable?
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:13.180]   Just experience rather than in a medical event and what what what my wife found is that she found herself much
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:20.740]   feeling much safer and much more relaxed than if she were in a birthing suite at a hospital with
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:25.540]   Nurses and doctors coming in and stuff strapped to her stomach and the fluorescent lights, etc
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.820]   Now in most modern birthing hospitals
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:34.340]   What they've done is they've they've stripped out all the old-fashioned birthing suites and they brought in more of a home like environment
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:41.020]   And I think that can be a great great solution, but I would really encourage you to consider kind of some other solution
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.100]   We never had the confidence to have a home birth with our first baby
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.420]   We wanted to have a birth center birth and we chose a birth center that was very near the hospital so that if there were
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:53.540]   complications we could go ahead and transfer to the hospital and have the appropriate medical intervention, but
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:05:00.740]   Our experience has been that having a child with the use of a midwife rather than a physician
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.380]   Sorry rather than just an obstetrician just lent
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.260]   immeasurably to a far better
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:14.940]   Experience because the midwives have so much more experience birthing a baby. It just completely transformed everything and from a financial perspective
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:21.180]   While none of us would ever start with saying I'm gonna think about the money
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.540]   I think it's also foolish to ignore the money
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:28.340]   And so anything you can do to minimize the risk of having a $30,000 c-section
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:34.300]   Which then generally turns into if you have more than one child multiple c-sections down the road
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:41.980]   It's well worth the investment spending the money spending the time and really thinking carefully about it
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:48.340]   And so what I'd recommend to you is don't don't just assume because you are a physician that you know
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.620]   I don't know what your specialty is
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.660]   But don't assume anything about childbirth and really dig into it and work with your wife
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:58.140]   You got plenty of time and figure out with her. What is going to
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:06.380]   What is going to lead her to have the best experience I give you two more pieces of advice one mental and one physical
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.420]   with
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.620]   most women
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:13.460]   Especially first-time mothers the prospect of giving fear unless they've worked
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:17.780]   Sorry, the prospect of giving birth for the first time can be a very fearful experience
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.980]   I don't know how many birds you attended as part of your training and how many births you've been at
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:28.580]   But for the average new father and the average new mother they've never been to a single childbirth in their life
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:32.800]   And so all of their impression of childbirth comes from TV
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:39.660]   It comes from some mother, you know splayed out on a gurney in a bright fluorescent hospital room with her legs
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.740]   Splayed open a bunch of strangers in the room screaming your head off
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:48.700]   Like that's the basic picture that most new fathers and mothers have childbirth, which is a ridiculous picture
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.940]   but all that does is build fear and so one of the things that is
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:59.440]   Extraordinarily valuable is if you can help to build a plan that helps your wife release all of the fear that she has
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.980]   Associated with childbirth then it can help her to feel much more confident and when she feels much more confident
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.420]   Then the whole experience can go much better now
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:11.060]   Some of that is going to be related to understanding the process of childbirth
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:16.420]   So for example, one of the things that we were taught when we had our first child that dramatically transformed
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:22.060]   Our experience and also dramatically transformed has transformed the experience of other people
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.940]   I've shared this with is just physically understanding what happens with the process of birth
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:32.980]   So most women don't have any understanding of what a contraction is. They just feel like a contraction is this stunning?
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:38.260]   Bit of pain where all of a sudden they just can't control it and they've got to go through all this pain
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.820]   But a contraction is simply the natural process
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:48.820]   Where the muscles of the uterus press the baby down through the birth path until it's born and it's a natural process
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:56.420]   whereby the cervix thins and open so the baby can pass through the birth path and yet it's a physical event and so
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.180]   When we understood that it was a muscular event
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.220]   where you had
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.740]   you know the muscles of the uterus that that are kind of
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:08.780]   Crosshatch against each other and one pulls one way and one pulls the other way and that gentle process over time
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:13.340]   Presses the baby's head against the cervix and then in time the baby passes through it
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.700]   Transformed it because what we did was we started associating
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:22.380]   Contractions with a workout we started associating the physical pain of
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:26.060]   Contractions with the kind of physical pain that you have going into the gym
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.460]   So if you go into the gym and you're in there pumping iron and you're doing you know squats or you're doing chest presses
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:35.660]   Or benching and all of a sudden your muscles are screaming in pain
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.380]   You understand that this really hurts
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.940]   But it's not this
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:46.180]   emotional overwhelming thing that you just can't handle and and the secret solution to
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:52.060]   The the pain and your quadriceps from your squats is to stick a needle in your pen in your your quads and get rid of
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.580]   The pain you understand this is muscular pain that comes for a purpose
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:01.180]   and so once we started comparing the experience of contractions to
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:07.060]   Something like a really intense really difficult workout. It changed the emotional experience
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.620]   for my wife and
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.740]   Allowed her to use some of the tools and skills to manage the pain and not be
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.980]   Emotionally debilitated by it feeling like she had to have a needle stuck in her spine
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.480]   To somehow, you know get through it and so little things like that
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480]   I found when I've talked to other
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.580]   Expectant mothers and fathers and explained it and they come back later and said that was so valuable
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:35.820]   Another simple thing that we did was and this was part of the hypnobirthing curriculum if you choose to go through that
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:43.020]   but we did this kind of fear release exercise where I had my wife write down all of the things that she was scared about and
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:50.860]   Then we made a plan for them. So I'm of course sharing intimate details, but it's not I don't think it's it's a bad thing here
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:56.820]   But like my wife was scared of being pressured. She hates to be pressured or to be
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.500]   You know hurried she despises being hurried
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:07.260]   And so she didn't want to feel any pressure about the baby coming especially on the due date
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:13.400]   So to speak the natural range when a baby is expected is a four-week range
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:19.480]   It's anywhere from 38 to 42 weeks. That's normal. That's the normal normal range. And of course, it's different for us first time
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:26.060]   Childbirth versus a later childbirth, but what happens for a lot of mothers is they say hey
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:31.260]   My baby is due on June 1st and all of a sudden on June 1st all their friends start saying is the baby here
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.740]   Is the baby here then on June 2nd is the baby here and her mother-in-law says hey, is there any is there any news?
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.740]   Is there any news and then by June 7th?
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.340]   The poor mom is so freaked out by everyone saying where's the baby and what's wrong?
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:46.780]   And is everything okay that she can hardly relax and and enjoy things when the reality is
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:51.200]   The normal expected path time is anywhere from a 15 to June 15
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.980]   And as long as you're getting appropriate medical care through that period
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.460]   The baby's being monitored making sure the baby's okay. Everything's okay. That's normal
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.420]   and so
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:05.180]   Once I understood that that was one of my wife's fears we did some some stuff that just to get rid of it
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.060]   And so for example when we are expecting a child
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:12.180]   We don't tell anybody the expected due date of the child
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:18.420]   We just don't tell anybody the only person that needs to know is her me and the midwife and our backup doctor, right?
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:21.720]   That's it beyond that. Nobody else has any need to know
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.380]   So if the baby's expected due date is June 15, we say sometime in June or July
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.080]   Then you buy yourself lots of time and is that a little bit annoying?
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:37.260]   It is but it it was one of things that just completely released my wife from all of the the mental
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:41.760]   Kind of fear and stress of the the event now there are other things as well
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.580]   So just what I would encourage you is work with your wife to help her to understand
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:52.460]   What she's afraid of and then when you release those things then it dramatically improves
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:12:01.180]   the probability of having a comfortable healthy safe natural childbirth if you talk to start talking to doulas and midwives and they start telling
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.120]   you about some of the things where the woman is is in labor and
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.540]   Everything is advancing and all of a sudden it just stops. It's not
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:13.940]   Always and then I would now I'm not a pediatrician. I'm not a obstetrician. I'm not a midwife
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:17.620]   I don't know but I would say it's probably from listening to them
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:21.800]   It's probably a majority of the time something in the brain something mental
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:28.880]   where the woman is scared about something or there's a problem in a relationship and then the and it's and then the
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.540]   childbirth process doesn't advance appropriately and so
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.800]   Playing the mental game is super super important and whatever
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.400]   Situation is gonna make your wife feel totally confident totally at rest
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.840]   That's where you need to be and that's where you need to focus
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:53.440]   Focus your time and attention last thing. I am convinced that one of the important things to do during the process of
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.080]   childbirth is to
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.600]   Make sure that she gets regular chiropractic adjustments, especially that her pelvis is not twisted
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.300]   So I'll show on the video, but if you imagine that this is if you hold up
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:11.080]   If you hold up your hands in front of you and you make a V with your hands and you look through them
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.000]   This is the bones of your wife's pelvis
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.900]   And so if you tilt that and you just push one hand forward and one hand back
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:25.440]   What you see is that it makes a dramatically the dramatic difference in the amount of space that's available for the baby's head and body
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.360]   To pass through when the baby's head is passing through her pelvis on the birth path
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:37.600]   and so one of the things that we've always worked really hard at is making sure that my wife receives regular chiropractic adjustments during
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:44.000]   Pregnancy, especially if she's carrying that weight, especially if it's pushing lots of pressure on her bones
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.040]   And that's been one of the many things that we've done to try to focus on having
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.400]   really
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.700]   successful simple smooth childbirth
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:14:00.360]   Experiences you can't I'm convinced. Of course, you can't guarantee anything. Every woman's body is different
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.240]   There are many things that can happen that are out of our control
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:09.880]   But we've always just worked and worked and worked and worked for months just really diligently to make sure that we've done
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.660]   Everything possible to prepare for a really comfortable safe childbirth and thus far we've had four really awesome
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:20.600]   Comfortable safe childbirths last thing and Joshua's kind of standard new father speech
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:26.060]   You will spend a lot of time preparing for the childbirth
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:34.740]   The thing that I wish someone had told me before we had our first child was it's not all done after the birth
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:42.920]   The first few days in the first couple weeks of a new baby, especially the first baby are really really tough
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:46.160]   And so we were very prepared for childbirth
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:52.360]   What we were not prepared for was how difficult those first few days were going to be how difficult breastfeeding was going to be
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.720]   How difficult just settling into the baby was going to be
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:00.120]   We weren't prepared for that now second time third time fourth time around things were a lot better
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.960]   but
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.620]   Don't think that it's all over with the birth focus on the birth and focus on the new mom and making sure that you've got
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.400]   Lots of help and support and care for her and then
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:17.620]   After your baby is a few months old, then you can start thinking about all the other stuff all of the child raising stuff
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:23.080]   But that stuff there's plenty of time right now focus on the childbirth and those first couple of weeks
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:29.040]   It's a really special awesome time as a four-time father who has delivered all of his own babies. I
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.020]   Recommend to you and that's one of the last things I would say to you is that get in there and
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:37.340]   Receive your own babies. It's a it's a really
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.980]   empowering experience
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.120]   For a father. I remember after our first baby was born. I
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.640]   Felt like the king of the world. I felt like I
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.480]   Don't know how to describe it. I just felt like the king of the world. I felt like the most
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.040]   extraordinarily
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:16:01.680]   Accomplished and successful man in the universe and it was a really special experience for us. So there's Joshua's standard speech
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.440]   consider those things work them out do your research and
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.080]   Figure out what's going to make for the best
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.840]   Experience for both of you and you really can in a majority of cases
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:21.960]   Transform something that some people fear some people dread into some of the richest
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.160]   closest
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160]   Experiences that you and your wife can experience together
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:37.200]   Approach
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:46.480]   She's really not on board with that so, you know, so we follow what she wants obviously, but yeah
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.680]   Good things to look into at the business being born hitting a birthing looking at some of these other options that are out there
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:00.200]   So I'll definitely go dive on to her and let her look at some the other stuff
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.920]   I love birth tourism birth tourism is awesome. I
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:11.280]   Cannot imagine how we ever could have done it with our first child. I've talked to parents who've done it
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.800]   There it's amazing
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:19.760]   But I would not even as much as I like birth tourism when I think back to what it was like for the first baby
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.720]   I
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.760]   Wouldn't want to be anywhere except home. I want to be at home
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.360]   I'd want to be at home where our family can be there our friends
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.960]   to me, I think that's just more valuable than a passport, so
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:42.080]   Whatever is gonna make her comfortable is is where you got to focus but do the research and
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:50.120]   I'm convinced that you'll find the right solution. All right, I am going to go rapid-fire here. Let's see
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:55.160]   Cory in Minnesota, I'm gonna answer your question in two minutes or less if it's worse than that
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.600]   If it's bigger than that, then we're gonna move it to next week's to go fast
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.960]   Go ahead Cory
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   All right, Cory is right there, oh Cory is that we just came back Cory go ahead I can't hear you go ahead
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.800]   I
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.760]   Yes, go fast with your question, please
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:25.600]   $80,000 in sort of cash
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.280]   emergency fund maybe
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:33.000]   possibly some of it for real estate at some point, but I'm currently sitting in
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.480]   Partially checking account partially like high interest
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.880]   High interest 1.5% you know online savings account this morning. I
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.000]   heard on your last
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.720]   year your last show talked a little bit about
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:54.400]   emergency funds with credit cards and life insurance and things like that just thoughts on kind of where to keep that money and
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:02.500]   How to structure that I have a podcast episode in the history of radical personal finance
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.400]   Standby and I will tell you
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:13.920]   What number but it's called where should you keep your emergency fund and that will answer?
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.480]   The question so stay on the line
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.520]   What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the next question and at the end of the show
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.020]   I will mention the answer to that question, but go listen
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:27.940]   I'll tell you the show number and go listen to that show good out of Pennsylvania. Welcome to the show
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.940]   How can I serve you today, please?
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   Pennsylvania
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.960]   Go ahead
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.040]   You talk every now again
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:47.280]   Are they baking the list
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:54.440]   You know
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:01.980]   Yes, here's what I'm envisioning a little kid a very very young four two and one right now
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.340]   and I would like to
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:10.700]   Teach them life lessons through running into their own business teach them just what it looks like
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.700]   and
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.020]   also, I would kind of like to
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:19.100]   to find a way at an early age to
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:21.980]   through a family business
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:27.460]   Business or whatnot to have them have some earned income so I could start teaching them
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:34.560]   You know money skills and investing and even having the ability to open a Roth IRA for the while they're under 10
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.920]   What just is appealing to me? So I just kind of wanted to ask you from a I mean
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.140]   We have some things that we do. We're not really bakers. I do beekeeping
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.980]   So we make and sell
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:51.300]   High products generally that's honey and lip balm and things like that. So
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:57.980]   Just kind of your thoughts from a from a structure standpoint and knowing the age of my kids
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.380]   What would it look like do you think or how do you handle that?
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.800]   to get your kids involved in a way that is then
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.300]   business lessons life lessons money lessons, but also
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:12.780]   Also the potential of saying hey, this is earned income
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.700]   file a tax return kitty tax and
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:20.560]   Then have the ability to convert that into long-term savings for them
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.040]   It's
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.560]   Important to me. I think it is well worth doing
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.480]   I've got a lot of ideas on it the short version that I would encourage you is
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:37.800]   Start by thinking about the kind of business that would be fun to do
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:43.300]   That would also be profitable and that would build in just some
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:46.920]   Pathways where the children can genuinely be involved
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:50.520]   and what I'll say is call in next week and
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:55.760]   Remind me at the beginning of next week's Q&A and I'll try to put you in the first spot and we'll try to
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.040]   Flesh out some ideas that would be useful specifically for you deal
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:06.440]   All right, Texas you're on how can I serve you
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.560]   Hey Joshua, this is Trey I'll go quick
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:19.560]   I'm interested in possibly converting my regular w-2 job as a director of financial operations at a health system to
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.640]   Maybe a
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.960]   Per diem consulting arrangement where I'd have most of my same duties, but just have more time off
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.280]   And I thought that you might have mentioned
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.440]   some benefits tax-wise and being self-employed versus
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:42.880]   Receiving a w-2 I can get on my wife's insurance. So my employer would be saving my benefits cost
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:48.960]   I'm just trying to work out a way where I can have more days off during my not busy season
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.720]   which is the non budgeting strategic plan time and
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:58.160]   Not cost my employer much more because I'd want to probably hire an analyst at a lower rate
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.520]   To do the more day-to-day things that I'm doing not during that business
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.360]   It's a good question
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.520]   the first thing to think about is the actual lifestyle benefits and
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:14.760]   Things like having more flexibility with your schedule can be reasons in and of themselves
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.160]   Why you would want to do this even if the tax stuff is a wash
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:26.360]   When it comes to tax savings, there are two basic components. The first is possible savings on
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.800]   employment taxes and
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:36.160]   The second is other tax deductions. Is there something that you would be able to deduct as an
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.920]   individual business owner rather than
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.120]   You're being an employee
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.440]   I'm gonna give you the fast version
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.560]   You need to make more money and a substantially more money as a contractor
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.520]   Then as a w-2 employee for it to be worth it
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:01.120]   but if you can and especially if you can move to setting up an s an s corporation, then you have the
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.360]   option and
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:10.640]   possibility of paying some of your income out of your company as dividends rather than wages and
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:19.080]   If you can do that, you can possibly save your employment taxes, which would be fifteen point three percent
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:24.720]   But currently your employers paying seven point six five percent. You're paying seven point six five percent
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.640]   So you could possibly have some savings there
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:35.200]   In addition, there are some businesses that would fit well to significant tax deductions
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:40.400]   So for example, maybe you could go ahead and genuinely set up a legit home office
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.640]   Maybe you could go ahead and start driving your old beat-up car the and take a 60 cent per mile
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.080]   Deduction on business miles that creates thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of phantom deductions
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:58.800]   Maybe there are things you could do travel you could take or expenses for equipment or gear that as an employee
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.360]   You can't deduct but you can deduct if you're a contractor
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.080]   But at the end of the day
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.800]   You need to make sure that you're gonna get a better lifestyle benefit and you need to make sure
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.000]   That you're gonna get a decent amount more money
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.280]   so what I would say is call in next week and let's talk about the
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.320]   specifics of
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.840]   Your job and once again, like I said the previous guy
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.280]   Tell me when I start and I'll put you up in the number one slot next week
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:33.680]   All right, I'd love to do that, thank you so much good stuff. Thank you all for calling in for today's
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:40.540]   episode what I want to close with is the thing that I mentioned as far as the
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:47.820]   Episode of where to keep your emergency fund is episode 481 of radical personal finance from September 12
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:55.880]   2017 it's called where should I keep my emergency fund and it's an in-depth detailed discussion of
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.520]   The answers to that question of where you should keep your emergency fund
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.700]   So I would commend that episode to you if you're interested in the question
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.280]   Thank you for listening to today's show

[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.880]   Thank you all for calling in and there was one comment
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:40.200]   I wanted to add that I added on this screen as we go from one of the live watchers here on
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.800]   Facebook
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:50.520]   Watcher says Steve to Steven earlier question joining the military gives you a number of monetary advantages that most civilians aren't aware of
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.200]   Look into the SCRA and MLA
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.320]   Specifically off the top of my head the military will give you allowance to offset the cost
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:06.080]   Along with paid time off for you and the adopted child reddit has a decent subreddit called our slash military finance is a good place
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.800]   To start Doug Nordman through the bogal heads has a good book. He wrote to get you started financially with your career
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.000]   Definitely read Doug's book. I should have recommended that myself
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.880]   Doug's a good friend and he does a great job
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:21.800]   There are a number of personal finance bloggers that are exclusively focused on the military market
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.280]   And if I were in the military, I would read every blog post and every book that any of those guys had written
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.240]   That's it for today's show. Thank you all for being here and I'll be back with you very soon
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:38.120]   Welcome to Autozone. What are you working on today?
