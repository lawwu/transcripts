[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Today's question comes from Callum in Southampton, England.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.800]   "Hello Pastor John, after listening to episode 996, 'Do some people have more joy in heaven
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.800]   than others?'
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.920]   I remembered a number of passages in the New Testament where Jesus seems to suggest that
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.120]   there will be people for whom the day of judgment will be worse even than for the people of
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.960]   Sodom and Gomorrah or Tyre and Sidon."
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.040]   Matthew 10 verses 12-15, chapter 11 verses 21-24, and in 2 Peter 2, 19-22, it describes
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.040]   people who have known the way of righteousness and then turned back.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.800]   To them, Peter explains, it would have been "better for them never to have known the way."
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.640]   Revelation 14, 19 describes the enemies of God being gathered and swept into the "wine
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.000]   press of God's wrath."
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.160]   And this doesn't seem to leave much room for a hierarchy, so to speak.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.840]   I loved the explanation in episode 996 about the differing capacities for joy in heaven,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.520]   about how the most joyful in the kingdom will in fact be the humblest.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.600]   Amazing.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.480]   But does something like this happen in reverse in God's judgment?
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.080]   Are some people in hell able to perceive greater despair than others?
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.720]   Able to perceive greater despair.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.520]   That may be true.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.120]   I didn't expect him to end with that phrase, but it's a fascinating and helpful question
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.880]   to ask.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:47.520]   What we're actually told or not told in the New Testament is in what way the suffering
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.600]   will be greater for some than others.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.000]   But we are certainly told that there will be degrees of suffering in hell.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.640]   It will be unspeakably terrible for everyone who goes there, just unspeakably terrible
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   without any experience of good, no sight of beauty, no pleasant sounds, no bodily pleasures,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   no gratified appetites, no satisfied desires, no hopes fulfilled.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.800]   That's everybody.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:44.160]   So saying that there is degrees of suffering doesn't paint a light picture for anyone.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.880]   Those who joke that they'd rather be in hell drinking with their buddies than in heaven
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.760]   with stuffy saints are ignorant of reality in a terrifying way.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.220]   It's not funny.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.840]   They will not be having a good time.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:10.040]   But though hell will be without all good for all unbelievers, it will be worse for some.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.800]   And here, let me just read for the folks a few texts.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.960]   This is Luke 12, 47.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   That servant who knew his master's will will not get ready or act according to his will
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.140]   will receive a severe beating.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:37.400]   But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.440]   Now, it's just a picture at the end of a parable, but everybody I've ever read says it points
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.200]   to a greater or lesser torment in hell.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.600]   Or here's Matthew 10, 15.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.200]   "Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.120]   and Gomorrah than for that town," the one that Jesus is referring to.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.080]   So "more or less bearable" points to degrees or differences of suffering.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.520]   Here's Matthew 11, 21.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.760]   "Woe to you, Chorazin!
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   Woe to you, Bethsaida!
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.880]   For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.720]   long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.800]   But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   for you."
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.880]   So "more or less bearable" signifying greater or lesser suffering.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.800]   And then one more.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Romans 2, 4.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.920]   And this one is so striking because of the word "thesauridzo," which means "to store
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920]   up."
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.720]   It's usually used for storing up.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.160]   Like Jesus says, "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.680]   That's the word.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.440]   Only here it's used for wrath.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   So here's what it says.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.920]   This is Romans 2, 4.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:06.400]   "Do you presume on the riches of God's kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance, but because of your hard and
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.560]   impenitent heart you are treasuring up wrath?"
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   Meaning making investments in it, putting more and more away.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.120]   Like we're supposed to store up treasures in heaven by doing good deeds day after day.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.920]   These people are doing the opposite.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.120]   They're storing up, treasuring up more and more wrath.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.320]   Not treasures of blessing, but wrath for themselves on the day when the wrath of God—when God's
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.880]   righteous judgment will be revealed.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:47.760]   So in those four texts that I just read—and there are several more—I see two explicit
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:57.240]   reasons given for why some will suffer more than others, and then I see three implicit
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.600]   reasons that flow from those two explicit ones.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.880]   So let me just name these five.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.400]   One is—these are reasons now why it would be so that some are suffering more than others—one
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.280]   is that the more light you have, the more knowledge you have, the more truth you have,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.400]   the worse your sin and punishment at rejecting it.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.640]   That's right there in the texts.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:33.600]   Second is that the more kindness God shows you, not just in giving you light and truth,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:42.160]   but in, for example, giving you many undeserved pleasures in this life, the more grievous
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.880]   will be your unbelief and sin and your punishment worse in hell.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.120]   So those are the two that I think are explicit in those texts.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.880]   Now here are the other three.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:05.600]   Third, if rejection of more or less light, or rejection of more and more light and kindness
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.640]   makes suffering worse in hell, then I infer the more days you do this, the worse it will
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   be.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.880]   In other words, time comes into the picture.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.000]   Day after day after day after day, you keep on rejecting light after light after light,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.520]   kindness after kindness after kindness.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.480]   So the longer this goes on, the worse things are going to be.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:42.120]   Fourth, there are kinds of sins that are more heinous, more destructive, more blasphemous
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:51.160]   than others, so that not only the amount of sinning over time makes things worse, but
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:08:01.560]   also the degree of ugliness and horror, heinousness, and blasphemy also increases the suffering.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.760]   And then fifth, in all of this, there's a greater or lesser degree of high-handedness,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:18.160]   arrogance, greater arrogance, greater conscious defiance and insolence, and therefore a consequent
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.680]   greater degree of punishment.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.960]   So here's my concluding question.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.320]   What should we do with this information?
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.400]   Why are we told this?
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.360]   Is it to make us feel like the risk is not as great, or make us feel better about lost
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.760]   people going there?
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.200]   What's the point of this?
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.400]   What should we do?
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:51.280]   All five of these reasons, I think, are reasons for greater suffering for some than for others.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:09:02.560]   All five of these reasons send us trembling with joy to the cross of Jesus and to the
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:10.520]   grace of God, which holds on to us in the forgiveness that the cross gives.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.620]   So here's the way I think we should hear each of those five.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:24.120]   They make us seriously vigilant not to misuse greater light and truth.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.320]   To whom much is given, much will be required.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:34.960]   We should strive that the truth which comes to us would not come without humbling us,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.120]   building our faith, increasing our love.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:44.280]   In other words, don't squander precious light that God gives you in His Word and in His
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.320]   world.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:53.720]   Number two, we should be seriously vigilant not to misuse all the pleasures of this life
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:03.480]   by treating them as God, or a distraction from God, instead of signs that He's kind
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.920]   and is better than all of them together.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:15.680]   Third, we should be seriously vigilant over every passing hour and day so that they don't
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.880]   accumulate sins, but accumulate the fruit of righteousness.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.360]   Every day a precious opportunity to invest, lay up treasures in heaven, not store up wrath
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   in hell.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:38.200]   Fourth, we should be seriously vigilant over our pride, lest we fall into patterns of arrogance
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.120]   and defiance and saying, "Ah, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.360]   God can take His Word and stuff it."
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.800]   Here's a closing quote from Edwards.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:56.360]   I mean, if you want to walk with somebody who has thought deeply about hell, wow.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.400]   Edwards has a couple sermons on this issue of degrees of suffering, one of them based
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   on Matthew 5.22.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.560]   Let me give you one closing quote.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.440]   This is just an example of how seriously he took these things.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:18.720]   He said in this sermon on Matthew 5.22, "The damned in hell would be ready to give the
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:30.400]   world if they could have the number of their sins to have been one less in this life."
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.600]   Powerful.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.280]   Incomprehensible and beyond my grasp, but biblically grounded.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.120]   Thank you, Pastor John, for walking us through those key texts.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.000]   And thanks for listening in.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.080]   Our fall programming is fully underway now.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.800]   We recorded this episode in the studio in advance of Pastor John leaving for his second
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.000]   stint in Europe in 2019.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.680]   He and Noel are currently traveling and ministering in Holland, France, and Germany this time
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   around.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.440]   Would you pray for their safety and for the fruitfulness of their ministry?
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.040]   We would really appreciate it.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.680]   But all new episodes are coming up in the months ahead.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.120]   And the next one is, where should a Christian wife set boundaries in relationship to her
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.400]   unbelieving husband?
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.880]   It's a great question.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.480]   It's up next when we return on Wednesday.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.360]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   [END]
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   1.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   What is the meaning of the word "unbeliever"?
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   2.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   What does it mean to be a believer?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   3.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   What does it mean to be a believer?
