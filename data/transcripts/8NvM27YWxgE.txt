[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Now we have two remaining episodes this week,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.280]   both devoted to physical healing.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400]   On Friday, we'll talk about healing ministries.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   Today, should we trust them or not?
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   And if we don't, if we avoid them,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   are we doing so because we think
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.480]   such a ministry is fraudulent,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.480]   or are we doing it because we are stopped
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.700]   by our own unbelief?
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.800]   Great question.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.840]   But first up today, we talk about the timing of healing.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.680]   When will God heal us of our pain in this life?
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.280]   And why did Christ seem to heal so few
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.960]   in his earthly ministry?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.000]   At least it appears that way.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.600]   To these questions come the following excerpts
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.560]   from John Piper's sermon titled, "Christ in Cancer."
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.120]   This is a sermon he preached very early in his pastorate.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.240]   Already by then, Pastor John was only at it
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.040]   for about a month in his pastorate,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.880]   and he was well acquainted already
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.680]   with death and cancer and sickness.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.180]   I'll begin with his testimony.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   - Before I entered college,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.280]   I scarcely gave any thought to cancer
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.640]   and terminal illness in general.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560]   Then I went away to school at Wheaton,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.560]   and two of my very close acquaintances died
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.040]   before they were 22, one of leukemia
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.000]   and one of cancer of the lymph glands.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.120]   Then I went to Fuller Seminary,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.000]   and within one year, watched my systematics professor,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Jim Morgan, shrivel up and die of cancer of the intestines.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.520]   He was 36.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.960]   Then I went to Germany to study for three years,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.720]   and six months before I was finished,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.720]   my mentor, Professor Goeppelt, dropped dead
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   on the way to the subway of a massive coronary.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.560]   And then I came to Bethel and taught for six years
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   and watched administration and students and faculty
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.520]   die of cancer, Sue Port, Paul Greeley,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.240]   Bob Bergerud, Ruth Ludeman, Graydon Held,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.200]   Chet Lindsay, Mary Ellen Carlson,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.520]   all Christians, all dead
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   before their three score and 10 were up.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.400]   And now I've come to Bethlehem and Harvey Ring is gone,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.720]   and you could multiply the list tenfold.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.920]   What shall we say to these things?
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.960]   - Sobering.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.840]   And then I'm gonna fast forward into the message later
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.160]   in the sermon, Pastor John goes on into healing,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.760]   God's promises for our healing
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.040]   and his timing for that healing.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.880]   Here he is.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.720]   - There is coming a day when every crutch will be carved
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320]   and every wheelchair melted down
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.280]   into medallions of redemption.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   And Merlin and Reuben and Jim and Hazel and Ruth
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.440]   and all the others are gonna do cartwheels
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.520]   through the kingdom of heaven.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.360]   And we will rejoice, but not yet.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.600]   It may not be yet.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000]   The day is coming.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.320]   And that's my second affirmation.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   Third, Jesus Christ came into the world to die,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.640]   to purchase that redemption,
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   demonstrate its character as both spiritual and physical
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.000]   and to give us a foretaste of it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.800]   Now listen very carefully here,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   because right here is where I think many healers
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   in our day misunderstand God's purposes.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.360]   And distort his intentions.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.880]   The prophet Isaiah said in chapter 53, verses five through six,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.520]   a text which Peter in chapter two of his epistle,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.000]   verse 24, picks up and applies to Christians.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.960]   He was wounded for our transgressions.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.080]   He was bruised for our iniquities.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   The chastisement of our peace was upon him
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.160]   with his stripes, we are healed.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.040]   All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.000]   We have turned everyone to his own way
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.720]   and the Lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.040]   The blessing of forgiveness and the blessing of healing
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.480]   were purchased in the death of Christ.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   And everyone who joins to Christ
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   and lives for Christ will have both blessings.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.480]   But when?
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.280]   When?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   That's the question of our day.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.760]   When do those blessings come in full force?
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.120]   When will our bodies no longer be enslaved to corruption?
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.360]   The ministry of Jesus, as we read it in the Gospels,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.960]   was a ministry of healing and a ministry of forgiveness.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.640]   He said, for example, to those disciples of John the Baptist
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   who were very perplexed, he said,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.840]   "You go tell John what you see and hear.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.880]   "The blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.640]   "the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.160]   "the dead are raised up,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   "the poor have good news preached to them,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000]   "and blessed is he who takes no offense at me."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.920]   Offense?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.480]   Why would anybody take offense?
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.040]   He raises the dead.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.680]   He's bringing the kingdom, the long-awaited kingdom.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.840]   Why would anybody take offense at someone who can do that?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.120]   Easy.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.280]   He raised three people and left thousands in the tombs.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.880]   Why?
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.920]   Why did he only raise three if he came to raise the dead?
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   Maybe because the relatives of all the others
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.720]   didn't have enough faith.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   Baloney.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.320]   In Luke chapter seven, he raised the widow's son.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.040]   She didn't know him from Adam.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.560]   She didn't know who Jesus was.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.960]   She hadn't even seen him.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.000]   All the text says was he felt compassion on her
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.160]   as they were carrying the boy out of the town in his casket.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.320]   Well, didn't he pity all the widows in Israel?
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.920]   Sure he did.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.040]   The answer to why Jesus only raised a few people
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.640]   and not everybody
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.720]   is that contrary to Jewish expectation,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.680]   the first coming of the Messiah
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.760]   was not the consummation of redemption
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.040]   nor the closing of this fallen age.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.360]   The first coming of the Messiah was to purchase
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.800]   that redemption and to illustrate
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.280]   the nature of that redemption
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   as physical and spiritual
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.040]   and to give us a foretaste of it.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   He is gonna come again
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.920]   and now we know from his illustrations
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.440]   that when he comes there will be resurrection
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.760]   for all his people
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.200]   and there will be healing for all his people.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.600]   No more crying, no more pain at that day.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.080]   But let me stress here lest there be a misunderstanding.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.000]   We do have a foretaste.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.920]   We do have a foretaste of that redemption.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.640]   The benefits of forgiveness and the healing are real.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.480]   God can and does heal the sick now
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.400]   in answer to our prayers.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.720]   And nothing I say should be construed
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.800]   to imply that he doesn't.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.640]   But he doesn't always, does he?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.400]   The miracle mongers of our day
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.000]   who guarantee that Jesus wants you well now
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.480]   are guilty of a gross distortion of God's intention.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.440]   And I think it's this,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.920]   they have failed to understand the nature of God's purpose
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.480]   in this fallen age.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.720]   They have minimized the depth of sin
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.920]   and the cruciality of the purgative nature of suffering
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.560]   and the value of faith that comes through suffering.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.480]   And they're guilty of trying to force into this age
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.000]   what God has reserved for the age to come.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.120]   Notice the flow of thought in Romans 8, verses 23 and 24.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.480]   "We ourselves, having the firstfruits of the Spirit,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.640]   "even we ourselves grown in ourselves,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.080]   "waiting eagerly for adoption as sons,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   "the redemption of our bodies,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.760]   "for in hope we have been saved."
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.680]   Because of Christ's purchase redemption,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.840]   we already have the Spirit.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.520]   But it's only a first fruit, it's only a down payment,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.920]   it's only a foretaste of redemption.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.080]   And you can't help but see that when Paul stresses this,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.640]   "We ourselves, even we grown in ourselves,"
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.520]   that what he's doing by stressing "even we"
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.760]   is by warning the Romans and warning us
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.480]   against a false inference.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.360]   The false inference would be, "I have the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.200]   "Almighty God reigning in my life.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.520]   "How then shall I remain subject to the bondage of this age?"
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.640]   And Paul's against that inference.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   He's against it.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.280]   You can see it in the word "we."
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.600]   "Even we ourselves grown in ourselves,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.680]   "waiting, waiting, waiting the redemption of our bodies."
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.960]   He's against those who want to bring into this age
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.560]   too much salvation.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.000]   And here in this text,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.400]   we wait also for the redemption of our bodies.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.160]   And we groan waiting.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.360]   Christ has purchased redemption.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.800]   He has demonstrated and illustrated
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.840]   that it is both physical and both spiritual.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   And he has given us a glorious foretaste of it.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.640]   - Amen.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.760]   That was John Piper and his sermon titled
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.800]   "Christ in Cancer" preached a month into his pastorate,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.200]   way back on August 17th, 1980.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.640]   Sermon on Romans 8, verses 18 to 28.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.960]   I found this clip while listening through his early sermons.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.640]   And if you find the clip, email it to me.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.520]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.040]   and timestamp of where the clip happens
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.640]   in the audio and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.320]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.680]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.800]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   Well, God has promised to heal our bodies.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.240]   He has a timeline for that healing.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.920]   He could heal you today.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.640]   So then should we put our trust in faith healers
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.440]   and healing ministries today?
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.480]   That's the topic we haven't addressed on the podcast
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.520]   until now.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.120]   It's up on Friday when Pastor John returns
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.960]   in the studio with me.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.560]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.520]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
