[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   We get a surprising number of questions on interracial marriage and we take them very
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.520]   seriously. We should take them seriously and they come to us very seriously. This one comes from a
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.080]   young Asian American woman who writes, "Dear Pastor John, my boyfriend and I are both believers in
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.040]   Christ and have been dating for almost 18 months. We love each other very much and really want to
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.320]   be married. However, my boyfriend has a conscience struggle because he has been told in the past that
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.960]   interracial marriage is a sin. We are of different nationalities, although we were born in the same
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.640]   city and country and raised in the same high school. The only thing different about us is our
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.000]   skin color and cultural differences that every family has. My boyfriend really is trying to look
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.560]   at God's Word to see what God teaches on the issue of interracial marriage. He's listened to many good
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.600]   sermons on the topic, but he still finds in his conscience like it may be wrong to marry someone
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.720]   from another ethnic background. This causes him lots of heartache because he has the desire to
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.400]   marry me. What would you say to me and to my boyfriend?" Well, this question goes very deep
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.600]   with me because my opposition to interracial marriage was the foundation, at least
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.160]   the conscious foundation, of my opposition to integration, my opposition to lots of good things,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.960]   and my support for segregation as a teenager in South Carolina when I was growing up.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.040]   And I think it was the origin of most of my deplorable attitudes towards other races in
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.200]   those days. So I wasn't just taught that it was a sin. I believed it was a sin.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.560]   So I don't take this struggle lightly, and I very much would love to persuade this young man
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.400]   that biblically his conscience should be clear in marrying a godly, Christ-exalting,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.960]   otherwise compatible woman, whatever race she is. That's what I hope I can do. Now I know—I
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.600]   was one, and I was related to hundreds—I know that among thousands of Christians,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   there is a conviction that this kind of opposition to interracial marriage is grounded in Scripture.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.440]   The Scripture teaches it's wrong to marry across races. Now here's an example from a letter that
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.000]   I got some years ago. "As individuals, they, the blacks, are precious souls for whom Christ died
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.760]   and whom we are to love and seek to win. As a race, however, they are unique and different
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.520]   and have their own culture. I would never marry a black." Why? "Because I believe God made the
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.880]   races, separated them, and set the bounds of their habitation." Deuteronomy 32, 8, Acts 17, 26.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.680]   "He made them unique, uniquely different, and intended that these distinctions remain."
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:15.280]   God never intended the human race to become a mixed or mongrel race. So,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:25.440]   while I am strongly opposed to segregation, I favor separation. That the uniqueness with which
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.880]   God made them is maintained. Now that's what I believed when I was 15 years old,
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:45.040]   and it bore ugly fruit. But of course, we don't base our behavior or our beliefs—we shouldn't
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   anyway—merely on ugly fruit and outcomes of beliefs, but whether they are in fact biblical.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.920]   So let me give four brief pointers to the way the Bible, I believe, supports
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:09.840]   the marriage of believers in Christ Jesus, regardless of race. Number one, all races
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:20.640]   have one ancestor, Adam, created in the image of God, and all humans following from him
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:30.720]   are in God's image, such that there is essentially one God-like human race.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.800]   So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him male and female. He created
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   them, and then the apostle Paul, rooted in that theology of creation, says astonishingly to these
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:59.120]   arrogant ethnocentric Athenians in Acts 17, 26, he made from one man every nation of mankind to live
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.880]   on all the face of the earth. And I think the point there, the implication in the context of these
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.080]   proud Greeks who boasted of their ethnic purity over against the barbarians, was that those
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.800]   barbarians out there are family. You better get over this. You are all part of one race rooted in
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:32.080]   one great-great-great-grandfather, and your arrogance of separation is sinful. Being human
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.640]   in God's image, compared to any racial distinction, is ten million to one in terms of importance.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:53.760]   Let me say that again. Being human in God's image is ten million, and any racial distinction
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:02.160]   is one when you talk about what's important in life. That's step one. Step two in the argument.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.040]   In Jesus Christ, God is creating a new humanity. You might say a new race, and it's called the
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:23.680]   Christian race. Read 1 Peter 2, 9 following. In Christ, ethnic and social differences cease to be
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.080]   obstacles to deep, personal, intimate fellowship. Colossians 3, 11. Here, that is in the body of
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:40.880]   Christ, there is neither Greek nor Jew. Those are significant physical and religious and ethnic and
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:50.640]   traditional distinctions. Neither circumcised nor uncircumcised. Barbarian, Scythian, slave, free,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:58.800]   but Christ is all and in all. So in the old humanity, the decisive factor in human unity was
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.960]   being created in the image of God. In the new humanity, the decisive factor in human unity
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:14.080]   is Christ is all and in all. To make racial and ethnic distinctions decisive in relations
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:25.440]   is to oppose the truth of what Christ is creating in Christ. Number three, the Bible forbids
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:33.840]   intermarriage between believer and unbeliever, not between members of different ethnic groups.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   1 Corinthians 7, 39. A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:54.640]   dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. So one key stipulation,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:03.760]   only a believer, only a Christian. That was Paul's way of expressing the Old Testament concern about
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:14.240]   intermarriage with pagan nations by the Jews. The issue back then was not race. The issue was faith,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:22.720]   religion, allegiance to the true God, Yahweh. Here's a verse, Deuteronomy 7, 3. "You shall not
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:29.680]   intermarry with the nations. You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:38.640]   their daughters for your sons, for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   gods." That's the reason. "Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you." But think now
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.600]   what happens when the people of God is no longer identified with a single ethnic group, namely
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.560]   Israel, but rather the people of God, the new race in Christ is being taken from every race,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.480]   people, tribe, tongue, nation. Now what do those prohibitions mean? They mean exactly what 1
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:17.600]   Corinthians 7, 39 says. She is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord, because that's the
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.520]   definition of the new race, the new people of God. If you want to talk about a prohibition of
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.160]   interracial marriage, then let it be the biblical talk about the prohibition of marrying outside the
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   Christian race. Finally, number four. There is only one high-profile interracial marriage focused on
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.440]   in the Bible that I am aware of. There may be others, and I've just missed them.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:59.680]   Namely, between Moses and the Cushite, a black woman from Africa, and we know she's black because
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:08.880]   Cush was an area of Africa below Ethiopia, and because the very word used for Cushite in Numbers
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:17.440]   12.1, where this story is being described, is the same word used in Jeremiah 13.23, where it says,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.760]   "Can an Ethiopian change his skin?" So Ethiopian there is the same as the word Cushite, and you can
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:34.880]   see what the point is. We can't change our skin color. Moses' sister, Miriam, criticizes this
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:43.440]   marriage between Moses and the Cushite, and God is so displeased with Miriam and her criticism
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.360]   that he strikes Miriam with leprosy, which the Bible describes as turning her hands
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   as white as snow, as if to say, "Miriam, you value light skin? I'll give you light skin."
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:12.000]   At least we know from this story that God is not pleased with Miriam's criticism of Moses'
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:22.800]   marriage to a black woman, and there is no other criticism of it. So for those four reasons,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:34.880]   and there are more, I think it is right to not simply permit or tolerate but to celebrate
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:42.560]   the marriage of a godly, Christ-exalting man and woman who are marrying in the Lord across
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:51.120]   racial lines. It will not destroy—like that quote from that letter—it will not destroy any
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:58.640]   God-appointed diversity in the world. It will, in fact, feature that diversity and the power of
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.720]   Christ in it. Amen. Well said. Thank you, Pastor John. And some of you know Pastor John wrote a
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.880]   whole book called Bloodlines, which deals with the race issue in far greater detail. If this is a
