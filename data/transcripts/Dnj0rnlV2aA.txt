[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   - Can you say what is entanglement?
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.480]   It seems one of the most fundamental ideas
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.320]   of quantum mechanics.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.920]   - Well, let's temporarily buy into the textbook
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.320]   interpretation of quantum mechanics.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   And what that says is that this wave function,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.880]   so it's very small outside the atom, very big in the atom.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.160]   Basically the wave function, you take it and you square it,
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   you square the number, that gives you the probability
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.720]   of observing the system at that location.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.960]   So if you say that for two electrons,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.360]   there's only one wave function, and that wave function
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.420]   gives you the probability of observing both electrons
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.560]   at once doing something, okay?
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.720]   So maybe the electron can be here or here, here, or here,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.800]   and the other electron can also be there,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.840]   but we have a wave function set up where we don't know
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.600]   where either electron is going to be seen,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.280]   but we know they'll both be seen in the same place, okay?
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.660]   So we don't know exactly what we're gonna see
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.760]   for either electron, but there's entanglement
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.240]   between the two of them.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.920]   There's a sort of conditional statement.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.760]   If we see one in one location, then we know
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880]   the other one's gonna be doing a certain thing.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.760]   So that's a feature of quantum mechanics
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.800]   that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.160]   In classical mechanics, there's no way I can say,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.200]   well, I don't know where either one of these particles is,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   but if I find out where this one is,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.920]   then I know where the other one is.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.840]   That just never happens.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.800]   They're truly separate.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.480]   - And in general, it feels like, if you think
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.500]   of a wave function like as a dance floor,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.680]   it seems like entanglement is strongest
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320]   between things that are dancing together closest.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.680]   So there's a closeness that's important.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.920]   - Well, that's another step.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.040]   We have to be careful here because in principle,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.280]   if you're talking about the entanglement
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.000]   of two electrons, for example,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   they can be totally entangled or totally unentangled
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.700]   no matter where they are in the universe.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.080]   There's no relationship between the amount of entanglement
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.440]   and the distance between two electrons.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.600]   But we now know that the reality of our best way
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.980]   of understanding the world is through quantum fields,
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.360]   not through particles.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.900]   So even the electron, not just gravity and electromagnetism,
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.240]   but even the electron and the quarks and so forth
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.640]   are really vibrations in quantum fields.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   So even empty space is full of vibrating quantum fields.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.440]   And those quantum fields in empty space
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.780]   are entangled with each other
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.160]   in exactly the way you just said.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.360]   If they're nearby, if you have like two vibrating
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.440]   quantum fields that are nearby,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.140]   then they will be highly entangled.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.800]   If they're far away, they will not be entangled.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.340]   - So what do quantum fields in a vacuum look like?
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.420]   Empty space?
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.160]   - Just like empty space, it's as empty as it can be.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.500]   - But there's still a field.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   It's just, what does nothing look like?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.360]   - Just like right here, this location in space,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.660]   there's a gravitational field,
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.660]   which I can detect by dropping something.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.560]   - Yes.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.360]   - I don't see it, but there it is.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.520]   (silence)
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.680]   (silence)
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.840]   (silence)
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.000]   (silence)
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.160]   (silence)
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.320]   (silence)
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.480]   (silence)
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
