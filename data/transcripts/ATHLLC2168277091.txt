[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.040]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.880]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.080]   for an episode focused on travel hacking, points, and miles.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.160]   This one is jam-packed with a ton of amazing hacks
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.600]   you've all shared, so thank you so much
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.560]   for sending those in, as well as some great questions
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920]   we're gonna tackle covering everything
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.840]   from paying taxes with your credit card,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.440]   to earning points, to companion pass,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.640]   to booking travel, getting deals, a bunch of great sites,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.720]   and things you can do to optimize your next trip,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.040]   and so much more.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.120]   But I have a few cool things to share first.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.720]   I'll start with some amazing listener wins
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.200]   you've all shared, and some of them
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.600]   are the biggest we've ever seen.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.560]   First, Savannah wrote this in.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.440]   "We have used multiple hacks from your show.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.460]   "I've gotten into credit card points for travel
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.840]   "and believe it will save us around $10,000 this year.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.080]   "From your show about insurance,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.820]   "we realized our house had grown in value significantly,
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.680]   "and we can now drop PMI insurance,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.280]   "which will save us $1,000 a year.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.400]   "I also found seven claims of unclaimed money for my dad,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.960]   "so thank you so much for your content.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.000]   "You really are changing the lives of your listeners."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Savannah, thank you so much for writing that in.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880]   It means so much to me that all the time and energy
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.800]   I spend can save people like you so much time,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.120]   energy, money, and bring so much joy to your lives.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.320]   I wanna run through a few more,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.240]   because there were so many great wins
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.320]   since the last time I did this.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.060]   Alex wrote in and said that after only a year
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.740]   and three months, he's already racked up
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.940]   450,000 membership rewards points on Amex,
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.020]   but he really wanted to make sure people understood
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.060]   that his spending is only about 20 to $30,000 a year.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.300]   He said he knew it was small compared to most people
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.220]   that live in more expensive places,
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.600]   but he did all this by maximizing referral bonuses,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.060]   signup bonuses, and using Rakuten
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.140]   to rack up over 60,000 membership reward points
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.280]   for things he already needed to purchase.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.260]   Zach, who we also talked about some wins
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.940]   about six months ago, wrote in with a follow-up.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.980]   He was a medical student.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.380]   He's now nearing the end of his third year,
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.020]   so he's making no income,
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.860]   but travel is really important to him and his girlfriend.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.220]   So over the last two years,
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.940]   with some great signup bonuses and redemption values,
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.220]   he just wanted to share that from March 2022 to May 2023,
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.820]   they've taken three international trips
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.100]   using all the strategies he's learned in the show.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.320]   He's earned and used over 800,000 points,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.400]   paid only $2,000 in fees
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.440]   to redeem flights and hotels worth $29,000.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.860]   He calculated it out after subtracting fees
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.680]   at 3.1 cents per point, which is absolutely incredible.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.340]   It's allowed him to have six weeks of international travel
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.020]   to places like Italy, England, France, Spain, and Portugal,
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.400]   and he said it wouldn't have been possible
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.560]   without all this advice.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.720]   So I'm so glad you were able to take those trips, Zach.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.740]   A few more, we don't talk about hotels
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.960]   outside of Hyatt that much,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.760]   but Noah had an awesome transfer
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   from 45,000 city points to Wyndham
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.080]   to book three nights in a beachfront resort condo
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.960]   through their Vacasa Partnership
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.300]   and got a one-bedroom condo,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.800]   which was way better than traveling in a hotel room
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.060]   with his three-year-old.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.800]   A different Zach wrote in to say
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.680]   that he's planning on using his points
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.200]   that he's earned to fly business class
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.560]   for his upcoming honeymoon with his wife
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.480]   on her first trip to Asia this year.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   First off, congrats, Zach and your wife,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.960]   and I hope that you have an amazing trip.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.760]   I know we talk a lot about international travel,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.680]   but let's focus on one domestic win from Angie.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.440]   She wanted to take her children to all 50 states,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.160]   and by August, she will have done it.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.320]   She did that by opening up an Alaska card
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   and her husband did the same,
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.160]   both of which come with a companion fare.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.800]   So between the companion fares
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.080]   and the points they got on the sign-up bonus,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.140]   she was able to reduce the cost
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.640]   of more than $7,000 in flights to Alaska
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.000]   for her whole family down to less than half of that,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.600]   and that was a family of five.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   Another honeymoon win from Lexi.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.360]   She booked 10 nights in Hawaii, in Kauai and Maui,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.280]   at Hyatt's using her Chase Sapphire preferred sign-up bonuses
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.360]   that she and her fiance opened up
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   to meet the minimum spend for all their wedding expenses,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.760]   and they're now going on a $6,000 honeymoon just on points.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.160]   So first off, congrats to Lexi and her husband.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.800]   I hope you guys have an amazing wedding
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.240]   and a great honeymoon.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.800]   Finally, Tim loved the Japan episode so much
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.040]   that he's already booked a trip using points
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.760]   to stay at the Park Hyatt in Kyoto,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.680]   which is an amazing hotel.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.780]   He's going in July.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.640]   I'm so sure you'll have a great time.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.720]   Everyone should check that out if they have the points
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.740]   and they have the opportunity.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.160]   And then the biggest win I think we've ever had
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.940]   is Liz wrote in and said that the insurance episode
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.520]   came just at the right time.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   She was pricing out life insurance policies for her family
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.000]   and didn't realize the concept of laddering or layering
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.980]   was an option and it was exactly what she needed.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.600]   So she priced out things with seven different carriers
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.920]   and the layered policy they landed on,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.720]   which is actually a 30-year term
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   with 10 and 20-year riders,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.880]   will end up saving them over $14,000
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.560]   over the life of the policy
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.120]   compared to the lowest 30-year term quote.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.400]   But she did point out
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.960]   that not all insurance companies offer these features,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.020]   so it's worth searching for one that does,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.420]   but it's also worth making sure
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.080]   that you push the agents on it
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   because her agent actually asked her
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.840]   how she knew how to do it this way
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.420]   and thought it was a really smart option
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.840]   that he hadn't thought about.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.320]   So that is awesome.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.280]   I'm so glad you did that.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.660]   So that's a few of the wins I've heard from listeners,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.840]   but I'll put a few more at the end of the episode
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.520]   'cause there's just so many great ones
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.300]   that I want you all to hear about.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.840]   Next, I wanna talk briefly
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.640]   about what the All The Hacks membership is and isn't
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.760]   because I've gotten a few questions from you.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.420]   First, it is not a guilt trip
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.320]   for you to feel pressured to join.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.960]   If you think it'd add value to your life
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.820]   or if you've gotten so much value from the show
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.840]   that you wanna support me, great,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   but if not, totally fine.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.920]   So what is it?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   My goal is to build a membership, something like AARP,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.240]   but instead of focused on retired people,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.380]   I wanna focus on people who like to optimize and upgrade
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.520]   and have the best experience and get the most out of life.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.200]   So I wanna set up exclusive deals,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.800]   products, and partnerships,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.520]   and I actually just shared our first exclusive deal
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.480]   to members with trust and will
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.740]   who is offering 50% off their estate planning services
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.200]   to All The Hacks members.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.900]   It's the product Amy and I use for our family.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.980]   In fact, we just updated it last week
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.540]   to include our second daughter.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.320]   I know, we should have done it sooner.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.880]   So that's what I mean by exclusive deals.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.020]   I hope we'll have more coming soon,
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.820]   but I also wanna build a community
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.640]   where members can connect with each other.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.900]   So that's gonna be a part of the membership as well.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.200]   In fact, our first members call is tomorrow.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.840]   So if you end up joining quickly,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.880]   I can send you the invite to that.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.480]   And then at some point, I wanna build a community online,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.160]   and I will consider opening that up
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.900]   or part of it to all listeners,
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.560]   but I'm gonna get my feet wet with members first.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   So if you wanna join,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.500]   you can do that at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.780]   And if not, I love you all the same, so no worries.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.460]   Now, let's talk a little bit about credit cards.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.500]   As you guys know, I have a page set up
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.460]   at allthehacks.com/cards,
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.900]   and one of the biggest ways you can support me and the show
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.680]   is to use those links when you apply for a new card.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.800]   However, like I always say,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.180]   I want you to get the best signup bonuses possible
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.900]   and sometimes those are from referral links.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.860]   Unfortunately, I don't have much control
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.580]   over how that page works.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.740]   So even if I know about a great referral offer,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.900]   I can't include it on the page.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.340]   In the past, I've gotten links from some listeners
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.540]   and from friends and put them in the show notes.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.380]   And then on top of that,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.620]   there's also some cards that I think are really great,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.380]   like the Amex Green or the Built Rewards card,
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.180]   that because they don't have affiliate offers,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.700]   they never end up showing up on that page either.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.700]   Finally, there's just so much good information
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.840]   when you collect a list of all the cards,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.000]   their signup bonuses, their annual fees,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.380]   but there's no easy way to filter and sort
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.740]   on that information.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.180]   So I had an idea.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.420]   I fired up ChatGPT and I asked it to help me code
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.360]   a new page that had all that functionality.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.520]   Honestly, I didn't think it would work at the start,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.500]   but to my surprise, I got way further than I expected.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.660]   I still have some design and user experience things to fix,
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.780]   and I haven't added all the filtering and sorting I want,
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.100]   but I actually have a working prototype of a new cards page
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.540]   that I'm excited to transition to soon.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.800]   I actually hope it ends up being one of the best tools
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.640]   out there to find new cards,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.380]   whether you wanna search on the biggest signup bonuses,
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.260]   the best earning in a category,
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.220]   or the best deals if you're over Chase's 5/24 restriction.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.340]   So if you wanna check out an early version,
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.940]   you can go see the prototype
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.220]   at allthehacks.com/cardtool,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.980]   and I would love your feedback,
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.220]   or if you're good with JavaScript or CSS,
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.820]   I would love your help getting it over the finish line,
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.300]   and then as soon as it's ready,
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.100]   allthehacks.com/cards will start directing to that new tool.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.100]   So you can also just wait for that to happen.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.480]   Okay, that's it with announcements.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.540]   So let's move on to all the hacks and questions
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.400]   about travel points and miles right after this.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.300]   First off, I wanna start with earning points.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.180]   So very timely, I'll kick this off
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.340]   talking about paying taxes with your credit card,
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.380]   because as of recording this,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.200]   taxes are due in six days on April 17th,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.380]   and I'm always getting questions from people
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.700]   asking if it makes sense to pay on your credit card.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.380]   So there are three payment processors
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.600]   that'll allow you to pay your taxes with a credit card.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.820]   PayUSA Tax charges 1.85%,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.660]   Pay1040 charges 1.87%,
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.520]   and ACI charges 1.98%.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.340]   I'll look at this from two perspectives.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.540]   One is, yes, there are cards like the Citi Double Cash
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.580]   that earn 2% cash back.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.820]   So if you owe $5,000,
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.180]   technically, you could get $100 of rewards
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.700]   and pay as low as 92.50 for processing them.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.540]   Is it worth it to make $7.50?
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.580]   Probably not.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.100]   If you had a massive tax bill,
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.240]   might it be more worth it?
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.980]   Sure, but at the end of the day,
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.500]   I don't think that kind of a spread
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.060]   is worth the time and energy
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.060]   unless you have a really large tax bill.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.740]   Where it might get a little bit interesting
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.740]   is if you're trying to meet a minimum spend
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.300]   on a sign-up bonus,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   or if you're trying to earn some points
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.340]   in a program really quickly,
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.660]   especially if you're trying to do that
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.460]   with a card like the VentureX,
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.380]   where you can earn two points per dollar
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.580]   and potentially make those points worth anywhere
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.020]   from 1.5 to three or four cents.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.820]   Couple caveats to consider.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.140]   One, you can only make two payments per processor,
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.540]   though if you're filing jointly,
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.500]   you can make them in each person's name, so four total.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.420]   All those payment providers have clarified
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.420]   that they will not show up as a cash advance
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.200]   with any extra fees.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.020]   And then finally, if you are doing all this for business,
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.780]   card fees are tax deductible,
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.700]   but not if you're doing it personally.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.900]   So if you have a redemption in mind
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.200]   and you're gonna get outsized value here, great.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.280]   If you're trying to meet a sign-up bonus,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.900]   or if you wanna open up a card quickly
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.580]   to try to meet a sign-up bonus,
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.700]   I know there are some cards,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.760]   I don't have a list off the top of my head,
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   of ones that will give you a virtual card number
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.280]   you can use right away.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.760]   That's worth considering.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.420]   But otherwise, I think the fee relative to the cost,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.160]   it doesn't make sense unless you have something planned,
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.580]   which is my general advice
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.260]   when it comes to buying points and miles as well.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.680]   Similarly, a question from Cameron
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.300]   about trying to put expenses for his wedding onto a card.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.420]   And in this case, the vendor only accepted a deposit
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.460]   and that the remaining they only accepted in cash or check.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.940]   Are there any tricks here?
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.720]   The short answer is no.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.240]   Yes, you can try to negotiate,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.800]   and if you could negotiate the credit card fees into it,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.240]   that would be an option.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.420]   If not, you're usually gonna end up having to pay the fees
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.260]   or use a service online
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.440]   where you can use your credit card to send a payment,
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.200]   but then you'll pay the fees.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.020]   And those fees, I don't think are worth it.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.960]   They end up being much higher than the cost
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.520]   to pay your taxes on a credit card.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.120]   I know they're typically more around 3%.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.600]   So unfortunately, there's not a hack here
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.760]   that I'm aware of.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.320]   But I will say, if you are able to pay your credit card,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.680]   you can always ask.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.800]   There are some cases where you might not expect
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.880]   to be able to do that, and that's possible.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.320]   So definitely worth doing that.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.440]   But if not, unfortunately, that won't work.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.080]   Cameron did mention that he got engaged a couple years ago
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.720]   and put the entire ring purchase on his credit card,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.100]   which is a great option there.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.920]   In fact, two questions wrote in about engagement rings
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.540]   that I'll share right now.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.480]   One, Tyler went out on a limb and asked his fiance
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.880]   how she felt about cubic zirconia or lab diamonds
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.280]   before they got engaged.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.640]   It turns out she was thrilled with the idea.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.520]   They ended up finding a ring that was only $650
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.040]   and put all the extra savings into an epic engagement.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.840]   And then Jeremy wrote in that said,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.120]   "Just make sure you're always looking shy
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.560]   "of the exact carat quartile."
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.040]   So if you're looking for one, look for 0.99.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.380]   If you're looking for 1.25, look for 1.24.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.200]   He also found out that jewelers have access
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.100]   to an online auction site for diamonds,
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.880]   where jewelers can request them be shipped
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.240]   for an inspection.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.160]   So Cameron ended up rejecting the diamonds
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.440]   the jeweler had in stock,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.580]   gave him the specs of what to look for.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.680]   And then even before that finding the diamond,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.020]   he just negotiated a fixed markup.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.200]   So he agreed on 7% above the price he paid the seller,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.360]   which is way below what jewelers used to charge
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.320]   before the internet made all this info available
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.400]   and ended up finding something great.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   So a couple of quick detour ring hacks.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.700]   Coming back to trying to earn more points on dollars
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.040]   without spending more,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.240]   I wanted to share a couple of things
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.680]   that I ran across recently.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.440]   The first, and I don't know how I missed this
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.480]   when I signed up,
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.520]   but our utility provider in the Bay Area, PG&E,
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.620]   at least now, lets you put your utility bill
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.600]   on a credit card for a fixed fee
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.680]   of I think about $1.35.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.620]   So first off, when I did the math
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.080]   of how much our utility bill was
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.180]   and what percentage fee that would represent
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.520]   and how many points I'd earn,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.320]   it ended up being a good deal.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.280]   But then I was reading around online
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.180]   and found a suggestion from someone,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.240]   which was that you can actually pay
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.920]   a couple months of your utility bill in advance
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.800]   and just carry over that balance.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.580]   So you're only paying that fee every quarter
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.300]   or really as much as you want.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.400]   In fact, a lot of people I guess have used this tactic
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.840]   to meet minimum spend for signup bonuses.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.600]   So they'll go and pay $1,000 towards their utility bill,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.840]   which might cover them for three, six,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.600]   maybe even nine months
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.800]   and be able to get all of that spend upfront.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.160]   Similarly, it had me thinking,
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.080]   oh, I logged into USAA
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.120]   now that they're our insurance carrier.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.400]   They don't charge any extra fees
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.220]   to pay your insurance bill monthly,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.400]   but at any point in time,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.820]   you can go in and pay off the remaining months
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.880]   on the six or 12 month policy.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.660]   So if you're in a situation
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.200]   where you're trying to meet minimum spend
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.440]   for a signup bonus,
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.120]   or you're looking at a signup bonus
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.800]   and you're not sure if you will be able to meet this spend,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.640]   two tactics there,
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.240]   pay your utility bill more than you need to
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.520]   if you can afford to pay off that bill,
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.020]   or go in and similarly,
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.340]   if you can afford to pay your insurance bill upfront,
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.720]   you might be able to pay that upfront
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.040]   if you're already paying monthly.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.600]   Okay, another question from Zach
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.280]   about whether to prioritize points bonuses
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.040]   or signup bonuses.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.760]   So he's looking at new cards,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.640]   thinking about his spending
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.460]   and seeing cards like the Amex Gold
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.260]   with four points on groceries.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.280]   He doesn't have enough spending
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.320]   to be able to hit all the signup bonuses
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.360]   unless he puts all of his spend on those cards.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.320]   So he's wondering if he should prioritize cards
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   that will earn him four points per dollar
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.200]   on the categories he spends most,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.640]   or if he should focus on cards to earn signup bonuses.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.120]   So let's take the example of that Amex Gold card.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.960]   You're gonna spend $4,000 on purchases
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.040]   for 90,000 membership rewards points
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.320]   if you use a referral link,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.640]   which I set up one at allthehacks.com/amexgold.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.180]   You also get $200 statement credit.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.760]   So for $4,000, you're getting 90,000 points,
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.000]   which is the equivalent
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.200]   of getting 22.5 points per dollar spent.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.980]   So much better deal to be focused on signup bonuses
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.280]   than to be focused on earning bonus points
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   in the categories you spend on.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.160]   However, I realized that many people,
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.520]   myself included a bit,
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.480]   don't wanna be opening up that many cards every year.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.680]   And so I like to have one or two cards
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.080]   that are just my base card that cover most of my spend
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.520]   and then open up opportunistic bonuses.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.440]   So it kind of depends on your appetite
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.880]   for opening up new cards.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.240]   And I've actually got so many great questions
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.000]   about opening up cards, the rules,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.360]   how often to do it, the impact on your credit,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.940]   that I'm gonna do a whole episode on that topic,
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.260]   but I just wanted to cover this as an example
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.140]   to try and answer Zach's question.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.120]   And when it comes to annual fees,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.980]   I want to remind everyone
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.260]   that there are a ton of opportunities
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.220]   to earn retention offers when your card renews.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.400]   I'll link to a good post from Miles to Memories about this,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.620]   but we tried this with Amy's platinum card recently
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.220]   and said, "Hey, the annual fee's really high.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.780]   We're not getting as much value out of it,"
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.820]   which was actually true
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.260]   because I have a platinum card as well.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.300]   And then they offered, if she could spend,
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.460]   I think it was $3,000 in the next 90 days,
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.460]   they offered 30,000 bonus points,
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.580]   which I value Amex points around two cents.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.020]   So that's $600, pretty much covers the fee,
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.580]   especially if you factor in all of the different credits
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.860]   and perks that come with that card.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.900]   So that was great.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.080]   With the tax filing deadline around the corner,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.040]   you're probably dreading sifting through all the paperwork
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.640]   to find those donation receipts
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.800]   or wondering if you missed out on maximizing
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.000]   one of the most generous tax deductions,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.640]   charitable contributions.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   Well, thanks to Daffy,
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.360]   I never have to go digging through emails or desk drawers
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.880]   to find my donation receipts,
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.520]   and I'm proud to be partnering with them for this episode
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.080]   because they've helped me be more intentional with my giving
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.760]   and maximize the tax benefits of charitable giving
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.080]   all in one place.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.480]   Daffy is a modern platform and app for charitable giving,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.000]   allowing you to give to any 501(c)(3) across the US
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.440]   with just a few taps.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.840]   And because it houses all your charitable contributions,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.040]   you only have one place to go at tax time,
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.560]   and you can easily automate and optimize your giving.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.720]   Daffy does all of that by helping you set up
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.960]   a donor advised fund or DAF,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.820]   which is a tax advantaged account
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.640]   that lets you contribute cash, stock, or crypto
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.960]   on a one-time or recurring basis.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.000]   Take the tax deduction at the time of the contribution
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.480]   and then distribute that money
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.060]   to over one and a half million charities, schools,
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.480]   and faith-based organizations whenever you want to.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.720]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.520]   if you wanna start giving today.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.960]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.800]   you can get a free $25
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.640]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy, D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.680]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.200]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.080]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.140]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.040]   and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.760]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.560]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.420]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.840]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.800]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.280]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.360]   that you got through another week.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.460]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.000]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.760]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.840]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.520]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.080]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.120]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.940]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.000]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.640]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.120]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.200]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.060]   or go to drizly.com.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.080]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.300]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.820]   Next, I wanna share an email Matt sent me
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.740]   that included a bunch of incredible hacks
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.180]   for earning some points.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.920]   First, he pointed out that if you're Canadian,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.900]   you can actually get a US Amex card
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.640]   with your Canadian credit history
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.040]   as long as you set up a US bank account,
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.820]   have a mailing address in the US
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.900]   that you can receive your physical card at.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.940]   He did it while he was renting an Airbnb in California
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.340]   and TD, his Canadian bank,
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.940]   made it really easy to set up a US-based account.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.980]   Then he pointed out that the Capital One
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.880]   shopping rewards portal often offers really big cash back
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.980]   on travel booked via TripAdvisor.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.280]   He's seen it as high as 30%.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.220]   It's often capped at $500 per transaction,
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.500]   but he's gone in and booked three nights in his name,
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.260]   three nights in his partner's name,
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.300]   and gotten $1,000 back on an expensive hotel stay.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.820]   He also wanted to share that he's been using
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.500]   Club One Hotels for stays over the past five years
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.740]   and is regularly getting 30 to 40% off
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.760]   the best rate he's finding on hotel websites.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.280]   He said he just stayed in Charleston
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.460]   at the Restoration during a festival
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.500]   and paid $400 a night when the own hotel's website
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.480]   and Trivago were quoting 700 a night.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.820]   Same deal for a trip to London this summer,
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.380]   and they occasionally sell gift cards for 10% off,
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.660]   which multiplies the savings even more.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.200]   Then for chain hotels,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.620]   he said check out Capital One Business Deals,
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.820]   which used to be called Capital One Spring,
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.740]   which is totally free to sign up,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.980]   but sometimes has ridiculously good deals
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.180]   at chains like Intercontinental and others.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.980]   Last for business class flights,
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.080]   he wanted to share that sometimes he's found
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.660]   that booking a vacation package
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.540]   and adding one night at the cheapest hotel
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.080]   can save thousands of dollars
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.460]   on paid business class airfare.
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.180]   He doesn't even always stay at the hotel he books,
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.420]   just does it to get a better deal on flights.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.180]   So Matt, thank you for bringing all the hacks.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.420]   Love hearing these.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.120]   I'm gonna add them to the arsenal.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.380]   Last two earning points questions.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.740]   So Kristen wrote in asking
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.960]   about whether the Bank of America cards were worth it
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.780]   if you have enough money in their partners
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.140]   and you can earn their highest rewards tier.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.760]   So I'll give a quick overview.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.180]   The Bank of America Premium Rewards Visa
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.200]   earns two points per dollar on travel and dining,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.000]   one and a half on everything else.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.580]   But if you have $100,000 or more in an eligible account,
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.100]   they bump that up by 75%,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.600]   which means you're earning three and a half points per dollar
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.900]   on travel and dining, or 3.5% cash back,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.100]   and you're earning 2.625% on everything else.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.900]   So I have to ask, how does that compare
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.020]   to what I would consider a comparable option
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.840]   on the points side,
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.200]   if you're not willing to spend the time and energy
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.360]   to transfer points to airline and hotel partners?
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.380]   If you're willing to do that,
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.440]   I think you're gonna get way outsized value
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.760]   focusing on earning miles and points,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.520]   but let's take the Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.080]   and pair it with the Freedom Unlimited and compare.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.000]   On the travel and dining spend,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.200]   with the Bank of America card,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.960]   you're getting 3.5% cash back.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.280]   With the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.040]   you're earning three points per dollar,
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.360]   which you can redeem in the portal for 1.5 cents,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.700]   so you're getting four and a half percent cash back.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.500]   So you're getting an extra percent cash back
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.920]   on travel and dining,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.000]   but for the everything spend,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.600]   you're getting 1.5 points on the Freedom Unlimited
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.160]   that are also worth 1.5 cents in the portal,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.800]   so that's 2.25% cash back compared to 2.625.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.920]   So at the end of the day,
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.880]   if you're using the Bank of America card,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.680]   you're losing out on 1% back on travel and dining,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.400]   but you're earning half a percent on everything else,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.320]   but you're doing it all with one card
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.120]   and you're doing it all without having to worry
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.620]   about booking in a travel portal and getting a deal.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.240]   I always prefer the Chase option
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.880]   because if you just want the cash back, that's fine.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.800]   You can use it as credit in the portal,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.160]   but if you end up wanting to transfer to partners
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.640]   and get outsized rewards on aspirational travel,
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.960]   you have that option,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.040]   whereas with Bank of America, you don't get that option.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.320]   So I've always preferred the Chase option,
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.680]   but if you only want one card,
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.880]   you only care about cash back,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.200]   and you're willing to put 100,000 or more dollars
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.140]   into a Bank of America Merrill Lynch account,
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.720]   and you factor the cost of doing that at nothing,
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   which is not how I think about it,
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.800]   but if you're already there,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   then I do think the Bank of America option
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.120]   is a great single card option,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.360]   but I think very few people are gonna be in that boat.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.000]   Last on earning points,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.280]   I wanna talk about Companion Pass.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.640]   I got two questions from Scott and Jomar
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.240]   asking about applying for cards to earn Companion Pass,
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.920]   how long it's good for, how to use the strategy,
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.100]   and how to do it with your partner.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.000]   So for people not familiar, Southwest has a status tier.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.120]   When you earn 135,000 points in a year,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.400]   you get Companion Pass for that year
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.200]   and the following year.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.640]   And Companion Pass means that anytime you buy a ticket,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.500]   whether it's with points or dollars,
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.160]   you can add a person to your flight for only the taxes,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.200]   which domestically are $5.60.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.920]   Now, you have to name that person in advance,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.000]   and you can only change the name,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.280]   I think, three times a year,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.480]   but if you're a couple,
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.840]   and you're planning on doing a lot of travel on Southwest,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.200]   it can save you a ton,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.520]   especially if you're flying
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.880]   to a lot of the Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii destinations
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.360]   Southwest flies to, but the strategy is when to do it.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.120]   So the trick here is that when you earn it,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.320]   you get it for the rest of the year and the following year.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.360]   So you really wanna make sure you earn it
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.400]   as early in the year as possible.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.280]   So if you're gonna do this with card bonuses,
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.000]   you need to make sure all the points you're earning
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.060]   post as early in the year as possible.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.180]   Now, it's not about when you spend the money though,
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.580]   it's about when the statement is posted.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.100]   So if you spend money in December,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.740]   the statement closes on January 1st,
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.140]   sometime in early January,
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.860]   those points are gonna post to your Rapid Rewards account.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.080]   So if you wanna do this, you need to hit 135,000 points.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.340]   You could sign up for either the personal cards
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.220]   for 50,000 point signup bonuses,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.720]   or there's 60 and 80,000 point bonuses on the business cards.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.860]   You probably need two, which you can do at once.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.540]   I have done this in the past to get companion pass,
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.460]   and then it'll be good for two years.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.500]   Just make sure that you don't spend the bonus early,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.360]   because if you sign up for those cards
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.980]   in November or December,
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.260]   and you hit the bonus before the end of the year,
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.760]   there is no way to push that out to the next year.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.380]   But the follow-up from Scott was,
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.700]   could he have his wife do the exact same strategy
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.660]   in two years, and then he reverts in four years?
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.940]   And the short answer is yes,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.900]   that is a tactic that I know lots of people do.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.660]   They sign up for the Southwest cards in year one,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.500]   earn companion pass for two years,
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   hold on to them for one and a half, two years,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.900]   maybe even three years,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.060]   just so you're not potentially
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.220]   having a bad reputation with Chase.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.860]   And then his partner will do the same thing in two years.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.020]   Obviously, you need to be able to meet
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.180]   the minimum spends on the cards,
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.580]   and spend a little bit more to get to 135,000.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.900]   So if you do two cards to hit 50,000,
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.340]   you still need to spend another 35,000 to get to 135.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.540]   So it is a big effort.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.820]   So this could be a great option,
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.620]   but keep in mind you do need to spend a lot
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.540]   on the cards to make this work.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.860]   There have been plenty of times
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.220]   where the signup bonuses on the Southwest cards
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.380]   have been much higher,
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.780]   and you've been able to clear the 135,000 point requirement
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.100]   in two cards with no extra spend.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.900]   So obviously, if you can hold out, and this isn't urgent,
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.500]   it's a great chance to take advantage of it
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.660]   when that happens.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.180]   So those are all the hacks
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.060]   and the questions I got on earning points.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.960]   There's a bunch of other travel stuff I wanna get to.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.460]   So let's start with booking.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.240]   I got a bunch of tips from listeners
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.620]   and things that I've found myself recently
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.100]   on trying to track fare drops.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.100]   So one from my neighbor, Joe,
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.460]   he said he uses TripIt,
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.620]   which monitors his Southwest fare prices
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.300]   and alerts him if Southwest fares drop.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.220]   And then Jessica actually pointed out to me
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.300]   that if your fare does drop,
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.900]   you can actually change the reservation,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.020]   and then it'll show you a negative amount
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.100]   to change it to the same flight,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.220]   and then you can just get a refund for that difference.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.520]   Unfortunately, not all airlines are that easy.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.740]   We just booked a flight for Amy to go to New York on United,
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.300]   and I wanted to make sure
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.960]   that I could monitor the flight prices.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.600]   So what I did was I set up price tracking on Google Flights,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.100]   and I got an email that the flight had dropped by $50.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.840]   So we went to try to do the same thing
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.420]   that you can do with Southwest,
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.460]   but United wasn't making it possible
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.320]   to book that same flight.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.840]   So we ended up canceling the flight
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.880]   and then rebooking the exact same flight with the credit,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   but because the flight had dropped $50,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.760]   Amy now has a $50 United credit.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.680]   So that was great,
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   but a side benefit was I hadn't really used
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.240]   Google's price tracking for flights,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.420]   and now I'm using it for all kinds of trips
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.160]   and getting updates on how those prices are changing.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.320]   And they even launched price protection recently,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.220]   which I noticed for a flight I was booking to LA,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.940]   where Google says if you book this flight through Google
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.800]   and the fare drops by more than $5,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.120]   we'll refund you the difference up to $500.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.900]   So unfortunately that didn't work
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.200]   for the flight I needed to take,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.120]   but it was really interesting.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.680]   But caveat, if you're using an Amex card
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.480]   that gives you a point bonus for airfare
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.120]   booked directly for the airline,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.880]   I don't think you're gonna get that airfare bonus with this
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.000]   because you have to book the flight through Google.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   If you're using a Chase card
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.200]   that gives you points on travel, I think you'll be fine.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Capital One has a similar feature
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.000]   if you use their travel portal,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.800]   and I have used that before,
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.000]   especially when I'm trying to use my travel credit
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.140]   for the Venture X card,
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.600]   but I haven't had the fare drop yet,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.560]   so I haven't been able to actually take advantage of it.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.800]   Tom wrote in another great hack.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   If you're traveling with a lot of luggage,
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.360]   he owns a video production agency
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.440]   and always has really big, heavy cases of equipment.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.760]   He realized that domestically,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.600]   checking bags can get so expensive,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.920]   and sometimes upgrading to first class can be so cheap
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.760]   that he's looked, and it's been cheaper for him
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.640]   to add first class for $70, get two free items,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.520]   including an overweight bag,
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.840]   instead of paying $40 per bag,
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.720]   or even $100 for heavy items.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.880]   So this is something interesting
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.920]   that I always do just for fun anyways,
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.600]   is I always just look at the business class fare.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.120]   Very rarely will I ever pay for it with dollars,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.600]   but I've occasionally seen it so cheap
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.640]   where in one case, actually,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.240]   I was flying to Southern California,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.760]   and it was only $20 to upgrade to business class on Alaska.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.980]   So in that case, I just said, "Why not?"
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.640]   Next, Jared sent in a hack that was a little bit longer,
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.360]   but it saved him hundreds of dollars on a rental car,
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.400]   so I thought it'd be worth going into.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.360]   And he actually stumbled on it by accident,
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.280]   so I thought it was a really cool story.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.720]   He'd been looking for a 2 1/2 week rental car
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.280]   out of Dallas-Fort Worth,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.080]   and was seeing all these different prices
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.300]   depending on what device and shopping portal he went on,
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.640]   but he actually noticed on the Hertz app on his phone
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.960]   that a Tesla Model 3 was actually the cheapest option
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.760]   for only $600.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.580]   But then when he looked on his computer and every browser,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.800]   it was almost twice as expensive,
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.840]   or he couldn't even see a Tesla,
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.520]   and it was gonna come out to almost $1,000.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.720]   He tried using the Amex Platinum discount, no luck,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.420]   and he almost booked it on his phone,
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.520]   but the Capital One shopping portal had 30% back on Hertz
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.280]   if he booked on the Hertz website,
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.080]   so he really wanted to book it there.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.520]   And after some digging,
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.960]   he found that when you use the Hertz app,
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   they'll apply a corporate code,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.560]   and they'll apply a rate code prepay.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.420]   And that shows you prepaid rates
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.540]   that you won't see on the website
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.480]   unless you apply that code.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.780]   So sure enough, he typed into the rate code box
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.600]   labeled RQ, prepay, all one word,
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.500]   and boom, he found the Tesla Model 3
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.740]   for the same price he found in the app on the website,
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.500]   booked it with the Capital One shopping portal,
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.420]   and now is saving over $500 between the rate
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.620]   and being able to use that 30% back from the shopping portal.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.640]   And just to make it even sweeter,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.900]   this purchase puts him right over the edge
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.340]   for his Delta Reserve card,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.900]   so he's getting 120,000 points and 10,000 MQMs.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.180]   So he's really stoked,
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.840]   and I'm excited to learn another hack for rental cars.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.660]   One more little hack that I thought was great
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.580]   was from Julie, who wanted to share
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.020]   that she's been getting incredible value
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.980]   from using IHG points on hotels all over Europe,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.300]   but she was trying to use one of her free night certificates
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.420]   and wasn't able to do it for a trip she wanted to take
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.840]   because it turns out it was a football weekend
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.360]   in the city she was going to,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.760]   and all the rooms had a two-night minimum.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   Well, she tried calling the manager
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.480]   and asking if he would lift the two-night minimum
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.840]   for 15 minutes while she booked online
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   because she actually wanted to book two nights,
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.720]   but she could only book them one at a time
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.560]   using her certificates.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.040]   If you had asked me if this would have worked,
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.920]   I would have told you it's not worth your time,
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.940]   but I'm clearly wrong.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.280]   Great job, Julie.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.200]   I didn't even know that a manager at a hotel
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.420]   would be able to lift that restriction so easily
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.940]   or would be willing to do it for a short window of time,
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.780]   but it turns out that was the case,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.540]   and she got that hotel, which was running over $600 a night,
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.780]   so it was a great deal.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.380]   Then I got a question recently
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.340]   about the 25% transfer bonus from Chase to Flying Blue.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.580]   So right now, until May 15th,
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.780]   you can get a 25% bonus when you transfer
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.180]   from Chase to Air France KLM's Flying Blue,
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.440]   and Myles wanted to know if it was worth doing this
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.340]   in anticipation of a trip.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.060]   He says he's a Delta guy, so this seemed like a good deal,
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.900]   and he wanted to know if the goal
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.660]   is to book Delta One flights, if this is worth doing.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.220]   I have the same feeling here, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.240]   about paying for points or buying points.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.140]   I really try to avoid doing this
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.220]   until there's a specific redemption in mind.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.640]   It sounds like he's kind of on the fence
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.680]   where he knows a idea of a redemption,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.620]   but not a specific redemption, and so I can see the allure.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.920]   However, I just think that there are circumstances
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.500]   that you might not be able to predict,
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.220]   that you might need to take a flight,
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.380]   and it's not available to partner inventory,
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.780]   and so you aren't able to book it on Air France,
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.580]   and now you just have Myles and Air France
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.080]   that are harder to use,
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.040]   or maybe there's something else comes up,
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.860]   and you wish that you had those Chase points
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.560]   to transfer somewhere else.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.980]   If you look historically,
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   Air France has had a 25% transfer bonus
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.460]   every year since 2018, including twice in 2022,
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.220]   and in 2020, the bonus was 30%.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.620]   So I think unless you're really coming up on a trip soon,
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.140]   and you've already done some searching,
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.020]   and you know the availability is pretty good
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.700]   for when you wanna go, you're just not sure on exact dates,
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.140]   I would hold off and wait
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.740]   until you are more certain about the trip,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.660]   especially knowing that this is the kind of bonus
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.660]   that we see pretty regularly.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.140]   And on the note of booking with partners,
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.700]   Caroline wrote in a question.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.260]   She said she has 250,000 Capital One points, nice job,
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.900]   and she started thinking differently
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.960]   about how to use her points.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.940]   She was looking to transfer to Air France or Virgin,
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.660]   but she comes into a problem.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.060]   Every time she searches on these sites,
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.620]   she can't find the flight she's looking for,
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.600]   and wanted to know if she's searching wrong.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.060]   And this comes back to one of the challenges
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.140]   of trying to get outsized value from your points.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.060]   It's that you can't expect to be able to fly
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.620]   on every flight on every day for really popular routes.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.580]   You might need to book super last minute
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.620]   or super far in advance.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.220]   So the way it typically works is that airlines
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.820]   have two types of availability for flights with points.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.460]   There's their saver availability,
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.700]   and then all the general availability.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.560]   And so if you're looking on a site like United
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.280]   or Delta or American,
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.440]   you can usually book any of their flights with points,
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.620]   but only some of them will be a reasonable number of points.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.380]   I've looked at United and found flights to London
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.660]   for 60,000 in points in business class.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.380]   And then I've also seen it be close to 200,000
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.660]   for a flight as similar as the same day.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.620]   So that saver availability when it's lower like 60,000
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.660]   is what they make available to partners.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.380]   So if you're not seeing that saver availability
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.260]   with an airline,
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   you're definitely not gonna see that availability
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.660]   booking Delta through Air France
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.340]   or Lufthansa through United or anything like that.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.660]   So the challenge is it just takes a little bit more time,
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.260]   a little bit more searching,
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.660]   and it can sometimes be easier to search on the airline
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.540]   you wanna fly on websites first,
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.540]   and then searching on the program you have points for
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.140]   once you've found the dates.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.500]   The added bonus there is that the airline websites
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.140]   for their own flights often have a calendar view
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.240]   where you can see more dates at once.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.420]   Or you can use a tool like point.me,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.820]   which will let you search all of the options,
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.980]   but you can only search one day at a time.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.020]   Or there's a cool site called Seatspy.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.080]   They only support a handful of routes,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.300]   but they do support searching a year at a time.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.980]   So you can see the entire year of dates,
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.300]   but again, it's only for a limited number of routes
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.980]   on a limited number of airlines,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.860]   but there are some decent options.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   But it's enough that if your trip is supported,
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.020]   it might be a good option.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.460]   Mike actually wrote in a question
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.660]   that seems as if he's taking the trip Caroline wants to take
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.820]   and wanted to know if he was booking a flight
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.440]   with Virgin Miles on Air France,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.660]   and Air France changes that flight,
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.780]   whether it's to a different day or even cancels it,
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.100]   what happens?
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.900]   It feels like Air France might claim
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.320]   that they're unable to do anything
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.260]   because he booked it through Virgin,
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.260]   and Virgin will say we're unable to do anything
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.740]   'cause it's on Air France.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.820]   And then he's stuck in the middle of two airlines
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.000]   that are saying call each other.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.460]   So I emailed Tiffany Funk, who I've had on the show,
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.360]   who runs point.me and asked her specifically how this works.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.180]   And she said that as the operating carrier,
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.260]   it's Air France's responsibility to accommodate them.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.820]   And there doesn't need to be award inventory
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.900]   for Air France to rebook them on another flight.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.700]   I have had this happen in the past
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.340]   and ended up being quite an amazing experience.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.520]   Air France actually canceled a flight from Paris
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.420]   to the Seychelles on our honeymoon.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.160]   And so they ended up rebooking us
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.020]   in Emirates business class,
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.160]   which while we had a stopover was a much nicer flight.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.380]   However, because Virgin is the ticketing carrier,
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.340]   it turns out that they usually need to all do this together.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.380]   So fortunately, airlines have liaison desks
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.940]   for these exact issues,
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.260]   but it isn't uncommon to end up on a three-way call
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.300]   because not all airline agents
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.760]   know that liaison desks even exist.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.380]   So I'll link to a couple of blog posts
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.780]   Tiffany shared with me,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.780]   but I will say if you're in this situation
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.820]   and you're willing to put in the time and energy,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.860]   I don't think it's one you need to worry about.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.460]   It'll just take a little bit of time.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.860]   All that said, if it is the day of travel,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.380]   once the ticket goes under airport control,
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.600]   whoever's operating the flight has free reign
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.940]   to do everything and you won't have this problem.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.660]   Next, Erin wrote in hoping to go to Paris this spring
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.420]   and said that she found tickets for her family of four
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.180]   from Seattle to Munich flying through Paris,
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.480]   but oddly couldn't find the Seattle to Paris flight
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.640]   for the same price and it was double the points.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.580]   So she wanted to know,
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.000]   could she just buy the Seattle to Munich flight
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.900]   and get off in Paris and not take the next route?
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.460]   She said, which is a very important thing
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.100]   that she'd only have carry-ons
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.500]   and she wanted to know my thoughts on trying to do this.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.140]   In her case, her return flight is already booked home
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.020]   on a separate ticket.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.060]   So she's already covered most of the bases
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.300]   and there's actually a website called SkipLagged
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.580]   that helps you do this kind of searching for deals like this
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.600]   on paid tickets, but when it comes to award tickets,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.780]   there are a few things that are similar
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.700]   and a few things are different.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.380]   First off, the flight that you skip
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.800]   always has to be the last flight in the entire itinerary.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.460]   So if you were to book a round trip,
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.180]   once you miss one leg, the entire rest of the ticket
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.040]   will most likely get canceled.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.140]   So I would make sure that you're only trying to do this
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.100]   where you're skipping the last leg of your trip.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.260]   Second, you need to make sure you're not checking bags
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.260]   because if your bags get checked,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.380]   they'll likely get checked through the final destination
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.140]   and they won't be where you are if you get off your flight.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.300]   There's obviously a risk that when you check in,
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.220]   they'll ask you to gate check your bag
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.720]   because maybe the overhead bins are full.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.220]   That doesn't happen as much internationally,
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.220]   but I would just make sure that if that happens,
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.540]   you ask them to not check your bags
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.460]   through to your final destination.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.180]   You could tell them that maybe there's something
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.820]   you'll need access to just in case
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.860]   there's a cancellation or medication.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.780]   They shouldn't have a problem doing that.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.400]   But airlines don't like this.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.320]   There have been airlines that tried to sue people
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.660]   for doing this and have been unsuccessful in doing so.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.620]   So it's not something that's necessarily illegal,
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.420]   but I would say it's a little extra risky
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.780]   when you're doing it with your frequent flyer miles
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.380]   because there is something that the airline
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.980]   could hold over you, which is the balance in your account.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.620]   I know if I were doing this and I've done this
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.240]   probably a couple times with paid flights,
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.820]   I don't usually attach my frequent flyer number
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.880]   to the account, or if I do,
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.820]   I'll attach a frequent flyer number for a partner airline
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.220]   where I don't have a big balance of points.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.960]   So I fly United enough that I have a lot of United miles.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.060]   So if I were using United,
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.700]   maybe I would credit those points to Avianca
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.540]   just in case there's a problem.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.660]   United's not gonna be upset about it and do anything.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.140]   I think the risk is low,
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.500]   but if I were doing this for a ward ticket using my points,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.580]   maybe I would either open up
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.220]   a new frequent flyer mile account,
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.420]   transfer the points there,
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.740]   transfer them to a partner where I don't have a big balance,
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.740]   or if I don't have a huge balance of points in the airline,
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.700]   it doesn't matter.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.880]   So those are some considerations,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.700]   but I think the biggest risk is that something goes wrong.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.240]   And let's say the day of they cancel your flight
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.940]   and they say we're just gonna rebook you
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.740]   from Seattle to Frankfurt and then transfer you to Munich.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.420]   And it's gonna be really hard for you to explain
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.500]   why that doesn't work for you
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.460]   without telling them you're trying to do something
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.020]   that they're explicitly trying to prohibit you from doing.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.980]   So I think as long as you are flexible
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.780]   with something like that happening,
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.860]   then it can kind of be okay
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.220]   and you're willing to take that risk on yourself.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.900]   That's not always a huge risk.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.740]   If you end up landing in Frankfurt
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.700]   and having to buy a ticket to Paris,
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.320]   it's gonna cost you some money,
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.840]   but it's not gonna be thousands of dollars
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.360]   and it's a pretty low risk that it happens.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.800]   That's something to be aware of.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.020]   That would be the biggest risk in my mind of this happening.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.320]   One other way to mitigate that would be to try
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.460]   and make sure you're doing it with a carrier
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.000]   where the stopover is their hub.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.280]   So for example, if I'm trying to go
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   from San Francisco to Paris
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.460]   and I buy a ticket to Munich on Air France,
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.160]   it's unlikely if something happens
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.240]   that Air France is gonna try to route me
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   anywhere other than through Paris 'cause that's their hub.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.380]   But if I were buying that ticket on United
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.060]   and they were flying United to Paris
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.020]   and then connecting to Munich on Lufthansa,
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.560]   then it's a possibility that if that flight got canceled,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.580]   they would just book me on a Lufthansa flight
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.560]   directly to Munich through Frankfurt or something like that.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.020]   So I'd feel better about it
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.340]   if the hub of the airline you're on
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.460]   is the city you wanna get off at.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.340]   But in general, I would say if you're okay
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.740]   with a little bit of risk, it can be worth doing,
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.740]   but it's not a perfect solution.
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.800]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.460]   but I am back into it now.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.920]   And honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.140]   is that I just added some new workout gear.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.420]   And if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.820]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.420]   which I think is Viori?
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.940]   And I am excited to be partnering
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.500]   with them for this episode.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.660]   Viori makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.520]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.800]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.420]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.360]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.460]   But it's not just for men.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.700]   My wife is obsessed with Viori as much as I am.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.860]   While my personal favorite
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.260]   will probably always be the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.780]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.180]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.240]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees, and I'm loving them.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.900]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time I went on a run,
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.140]   bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.640]   Their products are so versatile,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.900]   you can use them for just about any activity,
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.020]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.880]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.160]   or they even have a few things
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.840]   you can wear for a night out.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.680]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.000]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.380]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.140]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.960]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.580]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.100]   without our consent.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.420]   I found a listing for my dad on a site
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.260]   called Family Tree Now that had his name, age, address,
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.100]   phone number, email, past addresses,
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.860]   and the names of his relatives.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.420]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.540]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.380]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.500]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.780]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.700]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.020]   with them for this episode.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.020]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.100]   and remove your personal information
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.900]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.020]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.660]   and get that removed as well.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.580]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.940]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.460]   in their first two years.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.340]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.280]   for their customers.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.860]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.820]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.860]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.380]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.380]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.620]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.920]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.740]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.420]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.180]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.740]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.080]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.820]   Finally, Tony wrote in because he's going deep
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.440]   on Antarctica research and wanted to follow up
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.140]   from the Antarctica episode.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.860]   He hasn't booked anything yet,
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.660]   but there were two sites he wanted to share
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.380]   for anyone interested, Antarctica Travels
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.580]   and Freestyle Adventure Travel,
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.980]   who put out emails on cruise deals
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.260]   for Antarctica during the travel season.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.100]   And the lowest he saw this year
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.180]   for a double occupancy twin balcony room
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.740]   on a traditional cruise was $3,400 per person,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.920]   which is a crazy deal because the normal prices
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.100]   are over $6,000.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.460]   So if you're looking to go on an affordable trip,
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.380]   sign up for those and see if you can find
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.420]   some last minute deals and you might be able
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.480]   to get to Antarctica for a lot cheaper.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.380]   Next, I just wanna do a rapid fire
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.200]   of some sites I've found recently
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.820]   and you guys have shared with me
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.340]   that might be helpful for you,
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.780]   that might be interesting.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.860]   First, Justin tried to share this cool tool
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.500]   called AI Hotel Review that summarized
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.140]   all the TripAdvisor reviews using AI
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.100]   to try to give you general sentiment.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.120]   Between the time he shared it and now,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.720]   that company has pivoted to a new company
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.340]   called Where2AI, which is an AI trip planner.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.500]   You can also just use ChatGPT to do itinerary planning
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.500]   and I've been really impressed at how good it is.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.500]   So if you wanna try to go in the weeds,
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.380]   you can do it yourself with ChatGPT
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.020]   or you can go to Where2AI and go through
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.620]   a kind of interesting AI trip itinerary planner tool.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.140]   And right now, it's all free.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.540]   Next, there is a site called bagsaway.com,
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.700]   which is just a directory of retail locations
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.220]   and stores in a city where you can store your bags
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.480]   like you would at the front desk of a hotel
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.700]   when you were checking out.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.540]   So if you're on a day trip in a city
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.860]   and you want a place to leave your bags,
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.860]   that could be interesting.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.860]   Kyle shared a site highche.com, H-I-C-H-E-E.com,
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.860]   which looks like they're doing a productized version
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.100]   of that reverse image search hack I've talked about
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.820]   on Airbnb, where you can use Google Images
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.300]   to try to find other sites that might be listing
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.100]   the property you're trying to book.
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.980]   So you go there and you paste the URL for an Airbnb
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.460]   and they'll go scour the internet to try to find
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.700]   another website that might be cheaper.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.900]   So awesome there.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.180]   Mike shared a link that I can't believe that I missed
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.360]   before our London trip, which is deltaairbnb.com,
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.020]   where you enter your SkyMiles number
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.300]   and you start earning a mile for every dollar you spend
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.980]   on Airbnb on stays all around the world.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.000]   So don't forget to do that.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.840]   Thanks, Mike.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.940]   I can't believe I forgot.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.100]   Jason wrote in to recommend checking out Max Rewards,
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.780]   which is an app that lets you link all of your rewards cards
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.600]   and activate the deals and offers they have.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.380]   He loved it 'cause he got an Amazon offer
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.900]   that saved him $25, which was cool.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.900]   It's a pay-what-you-want app that costs as low as $5 to $9
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.020]   a month or $60 to $108 a year.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.100]   I've seen the app around for a while,
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.900]   but I always have used card pointers
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.580]   and I hadn't really taken it for a spin.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.660]   But for the purpose of this question, I thought I would.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.360]   I won't say I had the experience Jason had.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.220]   The first time I loaded the app, it didn't load
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.180]   and I had to kill it and reopen it.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.080]   Then when I went to link cards,
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.060]   it looks like it wants you to link your cards
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.820]   with a bank connection, which means you have
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.500]   to share your data to Max Rewards.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.740]   Normally, I'm not opposed to doing this.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.700]   However, when it doesn't seem necessary,
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.020]   I get a little hesitant.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.740]   But what actually had me much more hesitant
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.540]   was that I'm very familiar from my time at Wealthfront
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.220]   at all the ways that you need to present
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.940]   how you're collecting data and what you're doing with it.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.940]   And so whether you're doing that through products
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.480]   like Yodlee or Plaid, you'll almost always see a pop-up
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.100]   when they ask you to link your account
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.300]   that says, "Hey, this is what we're doing with the data.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.700]   "This is who's the party that's doing this."
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.540]   And in the Max Rewards app, it just switched straight
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.420]   to a box that was enter your username and password.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.100]   So I know at Wealthfront, when you put in your username
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.860]   and password, we don't store those credentials.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.180]   We work with a third party like Yodlee
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.860]   to be able to process that.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.260]   Company that's in the business of doing that exclusively.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.420]   It made me very hesitant to use their syncing feature
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.000]   because I just don't know what they're doing with the data
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.240]   and how they're doing it.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   But just for fun, I tried to do it with one Amex account
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.800]   that I was willing to change the password with after.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.320]   And it turns out, as soon as I clicked connect,
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.160]   it didn't work at all.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.460]   And they forced me to manually add my card.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.200]   I went in to try to manually add the card
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.640]   and there was a spinning wheel.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.940]   It never actually loaded.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:07.080]   I quit the app, came back in, it wasn't there manually.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.240]   I tried to add it again.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.200]   It was a spinning wheel, I couldn't do it.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.100]   So I'm not sure exactly how to get the value
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.500]   that Jason has in the app.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.060]   I was doing it all on iOS.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.180]   Maybe their Android app is stronger.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.260]   They do have a ton of great reviews in the app store.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.920]   So there might be something there,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.500]   but I couldn't figure out how to get value of the app
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.820]   because it just wasn't working for me.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.860]   And I don't love that you have to connect
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.280]   your bank connection.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.980]   So I'm gonna keep using card pointers.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.500]   If anyone has a different experience
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.980]   or if someone on the Max Rewards team wants to reach out,
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.780]   I'm happy to give it another look
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.860]   and share the issues I'm facing.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.220]   But for now, I'm sticking with card pointers.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.140]   I think it's a great experience.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.940]   They have a Mac, web, mobile, Android, watch,
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.520]   everything app, and they're all super fast.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.260]   I have partnered with them to get you guys 30% off
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.580]   at allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.380]   But funny enough, while I was recording this,
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.660]   I was reflecting on my earlier conversation
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.520]   about getting good deals for members.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.300]   I actually emailed Emmanuel, who is a listener,
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.780]   and said, "Hey, would you be willing to do
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.940]   "an even better offer for members?"
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.580]   And so through the end of the month,
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.460]   Emmanuel's gonna offer all the Hacks members
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.740]   who wanna sign up for Card Pointers Pro 50% off.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:16.940]   So that's awesome.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.060]   It's a great product.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.020]   I've talked about it multiple times before,
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.020]   but they will go in and add all the offers
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.100]   on all of your cards with Chase, with Amex,
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.740]   so that you're getting all the deals that you can.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.060]   Card Pointers actually hits Amex and Chase
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.260]   at the same time for all your cards,
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.820]   which lets you add the offers to multiple cards,
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.420]   but you can't actually do manually on your own.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.860]   There is a free version of the app,
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:42.500]   so you can play with it before you sign up.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.380]   Check it out.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.900]   Let me know what you think.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.300]   And if you're an All The Hacks member,
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.740]   keep an eye out for that 50% discount.
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.700]   Two more, Jason said to check out the app Fetch,
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.500]   which gives you points for scanning all of your receipts.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.540]   Said it takes almost no extra time,
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.920]   and he just earns a nice little bonus there.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.720]   Last, I have mixed feelings on this next one.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.420]   As a content creator, I don't love it.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.300]   But as a deal seeker, I see the appeal.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.420]   It's a site called 12 Foot Ladder,
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.700]   one to ft.io, and they have an iOS app,
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.280]   and they basically let you get through the paywall
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.720]   for articles and content that you'd normally have to pay for.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.860]   Matthew noticed that it even works for some of the ones
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.780]   where going into incognito mode doesn't work.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.860]   So here's the caveat I'll put there.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.460]   If you're just trying to get to know a site
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.460]   and you wouldn't otherwise pay or subscribe
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.420]   and you just wanna read an article, great, go for it.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.380]   But if you find a content source that you really like,
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.020]   I would encourage you to consider supporting them.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.100]   Being a content creator full-time myself,
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.060]   I really appreciate that support.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.700]   Whether it's by checking out the sponsors
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.820]   we have on the show, joining my membership,
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.020]   or using the links for cards on our site,
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.680]   I really appreciate all that support.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.200]   I'd hate to make recommendations
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.340]   that you should be finding ways
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.940]   to not support other creators,
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.020]   but this show is called All The Hacks,
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.420]   and I couldn't call it All The Hacks
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.540]   if I said all the hacks except for a few.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.300]   So I wanted to make sure I put it out there.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.380]   Last group of travel hacks before we wrap
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.840]   is when you're on a trip, and I'll just run through a few.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.100]   Garrett wrote in after hearing me talk about jet lag,
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.560]   and he noticed that I didn't talk about fasting
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.340]   in addition to normal tricks,
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.820]   but he's found it's been one of the best
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.660]   when he's come across growing up traveling
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.940]   from Sweden to Japan for three years,
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.340]   and now annually from the States.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.380]   He gave me a link to a Harvard post
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.000]   that I'll put in the show notes,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.780]   but basically what he recalls was fast for 12 to 16 hours
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.660]   and then break the fast with breakfast
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.560]   at your arrival destination.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.700]   Works better for some flights than others,
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.420]   and it means foregoing lounges,
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.580]   which he's a little bummed that he might be doing,
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.100]   but it really helped with jet lag for him.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.400]   He's not a doctor, I'm not a doctor.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.820]   This is not medical advice,
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.140]   but definitely something that you might wanna look into
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.560]   if you're trying to really optimize around jet lag.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.040]   Next, Kush wrote in, wanted to share how his learnings
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:57.260]   from a bad experience could be really helpful for you.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.420]   Back in 2019, someone stole his bag at a metro station.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.900]   It had his passport, his money,
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.980]   and all his important documents.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.460]   He couldn't find it and wasn't sure what to do,
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.100]   but he went to the embassy and it was so helpful,
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.860]   and he said, "I know anyone that gets in this situation
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:14.940]   "is probably gonna panic and be stressed,"
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.340]   but for him, the U.S. embassy was so helpful.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.100]   They knew everything about how to submit
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.420]   the right paperwork, expedite the process,
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.900]   get him a new passport,
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.680]   and they even had an off-duty officer
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.260]   that could help with guidance when they were closed
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.580]   during the holidays or the weekends
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.620]   if something was urgent.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.800]   So definitely a tactic I hope no one has to use,
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.700]   but if so, Kush, thanks for reminding everyone
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.780]   that your embassy when you're traveling abroad
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.260]   can be a great resource
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.040]   if you end up in a situation like that.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.460]   Similar to citizenship and passports,
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.060]   Rob reached out with an episode idea,
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.300]   which I don't know if it'll make a whole episode or not,
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.060]   but it's at least worth sharing here as I think about that.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.380]   So Rob is Italian, but he's not an Italian citizen,
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.420]   but he learned about getting citizenship through Bloodlined.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.540]   He found out that his great-grandmother
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.780]   never officially became a U.S. citizen,
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.420]   which left the door open for him and all of his Bloodlined
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:08.340]   to claim Italian citizenship.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.380]   He's been working with an attorney for the past few years
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.300]   to get all the death, marriage, and birth certificates
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.180]   going back four generations,
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.780]   and is just about ready to bring the case to Italy.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.700]   The nice thing is that the whole process
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.940]   where the lawyers do all the work
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.060]   costs him only $10,000,
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.260]   which will get him EU citizenship and a passport,
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.340]   but not only him, it will get his father, two sisters,
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.100]   one uncle, two cousins, and three nephews citizenship too.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.860]   If you compare that to the cost of getting citizenship
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.780]   through Golden Visas and other processes
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.540]   where you might have to spend $400,000,
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.120]   live somewhere for weeks at a time,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.620]   and it only works for one person or one family,
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.140]   he thought this was an amazing hack.
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.880]   The process is called Gisanguinis.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.500]   I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.700]   There are 12 countries that do this,
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.540]   and so since the U.S. is a country of immigrants,
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.220]   there might be other people that don't know about this,
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.820]   and there are a bunch of benefits.
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.740]   If you ever need to get out of the United States,
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.100]   you have an option.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.840]   Rob said it makes him feel a little bit like Jason Bourne.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.620]   He can work anywhere in the EU.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.460]   His wife can actually take a test to become a citizen.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.020]   He gets free healthcare,
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.140]   and he could even play for the Italian National Soccer Club.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.020]   It also makes owning property in Italy
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.020]   or other places much easier,
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.160]   and he can hide the fact that he's a U.S. citizen
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.740]   if he's ever traveling somewhere
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.260]   where he might want to do that.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.080]   Unfortunately, I don't think I have any Italian heritage,
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.940]   but if I did, this is actually something
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.180]   that I would probably look into.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.500]   It's super interesting.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.700]   If anyone else digs into this and has experience,
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.040]   I'd love to hear about it.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.580]   I'd love to share it with everyone else.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.540]   Finally, I'll share a great hack from my good friend Mike
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.580]   that is just the perfect hack to end on.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.700]   It's for getting free bottled water at a hotel.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.220]   So every time Mike checks into a new hotel,
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.180]   he goes straight to the gym
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.420]   where almost always there's a cold fridge with free water.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.460]   He stocks up on water in the gym,
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.500]   takes it up to his room
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.120]   so he doesn't have to pay the two, four, five, $10
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.240]   for a bottle of water from the mini bar
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.460]   and is stocked up for the week.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:09.700]   Though it's funny because I get texts from Mike now.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.260]   Every time he checks into a hotel,
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.900]   he just sends me a text of the photo
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.280]   of the fridge in the gym.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.360]   So every time I check into a hotel now
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.600]   and I want some waters, I think of him.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.020]   Hopefully you guys can use this hack
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.740]   and think of me and Mike as well.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.540]   That was a ton of stuff
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.340]   and I didn't even get through all the questions I wanted to.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.340]   There were a ton about opening cards,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.620]   how often, how many credit score implications
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.420]   that I'm gonna make a whole episode on.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.060]   There were a few about cruises
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.300]   that I actually wanna do a whole episode on as well.
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.760]   There were a bunch on booking hotels with points
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.380]   that I wanna do an episode on.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.820]   And then I wanna come back
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.940]   and do a deep dive master classy kind of episode
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.060]   on booking flights with points.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.080]   So stay tuned for all of that.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.700]   Lots of content to come the rest of the year.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.940]   If you made it this far,
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.500]   thank you so much to everyone who's listening,
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.780]   sending questions, sharing their hacks and wins.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.180]   I'm so excited I found such an amazing community
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.660]   of other optimizers and hackers
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.620]   to share this journey through.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.340]   And I hope you all enjoyed this episode.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.060]   Before we go, I wanna share a couple more wins
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.120]   that you all had
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.620]   because I didn't get to all of them in the intro.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:18.540]   Adam found $4,000 of unclaimed money
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:22.380]   from some old escrow issue in a mortgage after a refinance.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.900]   So congrats, Adam.
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.980]   Big reminder to everyone
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:27.100]   to keep searching for unclaimed money.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.680]   Then Medisa had an amazing experience.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.900]   Thanks to Trustworthy,
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.840]   one of the partners of all the hacks,
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.820]   where she was flying with her kids
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.060]   to Singapore through Manila,
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.320]   which she's done all over the world.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.060]   But she had an interesting experience
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.500]   where Philippine Air actually required her
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.740]   to show a copy of her son's birth certificate
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.400]   to prove she was his mother
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.000]   because of some of the human trafficking
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.440]   that's been happening.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.760]   She obviously didn't have a paper copy of it with her
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.420]   because she's never had to travel with that,
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.820]   nor do we travel with our kids' birth certificates.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.100]   But because she'd loaded up
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.220]   all of her important docs in Trustworthy,
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.340]   she was able to find a copy immediately
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.940]   and email it to them, which they accepted.
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.540]   And she actually wrote this saying,
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.020]   "We're currently sitting at our gate
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.340]   "and waiting to board our flight,
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.740]   "which we wouldn't have been able to do without this."
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.000]   She was so thankful for the recommendation.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.740]   I think Trustworthy is such a great product
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.740]   for organizing all of your family's
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.220]   most important information.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.060]   If you also wanna check out Trustworthy,
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.340]   you can go to allthehacks.com/trustworthy
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.780]   and get 20% off.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:29.020]   Finally, the last win I wanna share is my own.
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.460]   I was taking a last minute trip down to Southern California
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.700]   and I looked online and it was $200
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.860]   to fly from San Francisco to Burbank.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.300]   Now, I quickly did a search on United,
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.700]   saw that it was only 15,000 miles,
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.220]   which is about 1.3 cents per point.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.620]   But I ended up saying,
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.820]   "I wonder if there's a partner that makes this cheaper."
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:51.380]   So I went to point.me, I did a search
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:55.620]   and found the flight for only 6,500 Avianca miles,
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.720]   which I could transfer from Cap One, Amex or Citi,
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.180]   which ended up being a three cent per point redemption
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.400]   and made me feel a lot better about the last minute trip.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.060]   So big reminder, if you ever find a deal,
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.560]   make sure there's not a better deal
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.860]   by using a different transfer partner.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.460]   Point.me makes this really easy.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.580]   And if you haven't checked it out,
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.500]   you can get your first month for a dollar
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.140]   using the code ALLTHEHAX.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.700]   Just make sure you select a monthly standard plan
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.260]   and put the code in all the way at the checkout,
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.500]   not in the "I have a code" field,
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.260]   which is a different promo.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.180]   I also have been talking to a company called AwardLogic,
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.100]   which is a competitor to point.me.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.420]   I'm trying to play around
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.220]   to see if I can do a good review on the two products.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.820]   That was a lot of wins, I know,
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.380]   but it's just really exciting for me
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.620]   and hopefully for you to hear
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.040]   all the amazing experiences people are having
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.980]   using all the tactics we share on this show.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.840]   It's so awesome hearing all of those.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.380]   Finally, I just looked at Apple Podcasts.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.820]   I'm at 941 ratings.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.180]   I still have a goal to get to a thousand,
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.420]   which means 59 of you could help me get there.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.180]   So if you've gotten any value
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.060]   from this episode or this podcast,
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:07.100]   I would really appreciate a quick rating and review on Apple
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.500]   and see if I can get to a thousand soon.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.280]   Thanks so much, see you next week.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.640]   (whooshing)
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
