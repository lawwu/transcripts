[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Well, how do I bear with immature Christians?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.800]   The question is relevant to all maturing Christians, but today it comes from a listener named TJ,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.880]   and I assume TJ is a young pastor.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.760]   He writes this, "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.280]   When you were a pastor, how did you deal with the grief or burden you felt about the members
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.440]   of your church that seemed to not live like Jesus?
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.840]   How did you handle disappointment in people who are active participants in the church,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.760]   but who always seem to lag far behind in personal growth and maturity?"
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.840]   Pastor John, what would you say to TJ?
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.520]   There are two kinds of challenges that I hear from the pastor or from the Council of Elders.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.400]   One is the discernment challenge, and the other is the discouragement challenge.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.360]   The discernment challenge is discerning when a person is not just weak and struggling,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.120]   but is living out of a rebellious heart that looks weak and struggling, but deep down is
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.080]   very resistant to God and His Word, to the church, church leadership.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.200]   It's not always easy to tell the difference between these two.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.640]   The sincere, humble, often failing stumbler, on the one hand, and the person who's using
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.800]   weakness as a cover-up for hard, resistant, insubordinate, heart of disobedience.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.760]   So that's the discernment challenge.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.320]   The discouragement challenge is handling the discouragement of pouring your life out year
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.720]   after year and realizing that many in our congregation are not embracing the biblical
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.520]   vision we preach, and they're not being transformed into more holy and loving people.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.920]   That can be really discouraging.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.240]   It sounds like TJ is asking mainly about that.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240]   But let me say a word about each of them and then dwell on the second one that he seems
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.960]   to be most concerned about.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.600]   A pastor needs a robust theology of sanctification that recognizes the dangers of perfectionism,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.720]   on the one hand, and the dangers of carelessness about sin, on the other hand.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.160]   There really is a holiness without which we will not see the Lord, Hebrews 12, 14.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.480]   So woe to those who are careless as they deal with their people, as if sin doesn't really matter.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480]   You're all justified by faith.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   It doesn't matter how you live.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.120]   Woe to such pastors.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.760]   And it is really true that if we say we have no sin, the truth is not in us, 1 John 1, 8.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.120]   So woe to the perfectionists.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.360]   Woe to the pastors who have no sense of proportion, no sense of balance, no sense of how to deal
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   with people who are real Christians and yet stumble.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.000]   So there is such a thing as a fake faith, believing in vain, Paul calls it in 1 Corinthians 15, 2.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.920]   And there is such a thing as weak faith, little faith, growing faith, embattled faith, all
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.000]   of which are real faith.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.400]   And I would only mention one thing in regard to how to handle the challenge of discernment
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.360]   here, and that is take careful stock how the struggler and the rebel respond to correction
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.900]   and admonition.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:46.960]   The true struggling believer will be much more likely to humble himself and follow your
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.200]   counsel than the rebel will be.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.680]   So that's my word about the discernment challenge.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.520]   Now with regard to the discouragement challenge, that people are not changing the way you've
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.280]   prayed and you've hoped and you've labored and you've counseled and you've preached,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.920]   that's really depleting.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.280]   I just said to my preaching class the other day, that very question came up, somebody
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   asked it.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.960]   I remember a man who sat in the second pew on the right-hand side in the old sanctuary
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.120]   we used to have, and then we built a new one, he sat in the same second pew in the new sanctuary,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.720]   15 years at least, and when he passed away, I could see no change in his life at all.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.040]   No change in the way he talked about God, no change in the way he seemed to feel about
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.320]   God, no change in the way he talked to me about the concerns of his life, which were
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.120]   always something other than the Lord.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.800]   That was really discouraging.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.400]   So here are a few thoughts that I hope will help about this discouragement factor.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.760]   One, the New Testament recognizes this sort of thing happens.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.680]   In other words, you're not alone.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.280]   For example, Hebrews 15, 11 says, "We have much to say," and he's thinking about Melchizedek,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   "and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing, for though by this
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.440]   time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.120]   the oracles of God.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.000]   You need milk, not solid food."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.880]   So he doesn't seem to scold the pastors.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.440]   He's scolding the people.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.240]   He's going to refer to the pastors later on, but he doesn't scold them for this.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   The people have gone backward.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.680]   They haven't just stayed still, they've gone backward.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.120]   They've become dull of hearing, even as they listen to the teachers of the church.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.460]   So it doesn't mean we excuse ourselves as pastors.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.840]   We should test the content of our teaching and the prayerfulness of our lives and the
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.160]   example of our love.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.440]   But what Hebrews does is to call attention to the fact that there can be people in your
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.400]   church who actually go backward under your faithful teaching.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.840]   One observation.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.880]   Paul makes clear that there will always be different kinds of disappointments in the
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.080]   people of our church.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   He says, for example, in 1 Thessalonians 5.14, "We urge you, brothers, admonish the idle,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.960]   encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with them all."
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.800]   He doesn't talk as if those categories are going to go away.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.600]   Just work a little harder, elders.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   Come on, if you just work a little harder, you won't have to deal with idle people, faint-hearted
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.560]   people, weak people.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.640]   No, I don't think that's what he means.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.560]   That's a perfectionistic notion that'll kill a pastor, I'll tell you.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   It'll kill a Sunday school teacher, whatever.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.440]   If you think, "If I just work a little harder, all my people will move beyond idleness, faint-heartedness,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   weakness.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.160]   There won't be anything to struggle with anymore in my church if I succeed."
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.040]   That's perfectionism about to kill a pastor.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.360]   Third, be patient with them all.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.200]   Patience is a huge necessity in the ministry, and the key to patience is the double look
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:23.120]   forward and backward, forward to the promises of God to turn all apparent setbacks into
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   stepping stones.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.320]   Genesis 50 verse 20, "They meant it for evil, you meant it for good."
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.120]   God means this slowness of their sanctification for your good, pastor.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.920]   And then the backward look about the patience of God in our lives, the pastor's own life.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   How can I be harsh or impatient with a struggler since I have failed God so many times and
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.640]   he has drawn me back again and again and again?
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.760]   And here's the fourth observation.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.400]   There's a great reward coming for pastors who keep on loving and faithfully teaching
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.920]   and preaching.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.520]   They're people rather than being embittered and cynical and domineering.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:10.760]   First Peter 5, 3, "Shepherd the flock of God, not domineering over those in your charge,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:18.800]   being good examples, and when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.840]   of glory."
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.800]   That crown of glory is going to be given to faithful shepherds whether the sheep have
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.760]   been responsive or not.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:34.320]   In other words, when it feels like the rewards here are slim, don't forget the unfading
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.560]   crown of glory.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.600]   And I think the last thing I would say is be encouraged that God's Word does not come
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.040]   back empty.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   You may think so.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.940]   I mean, it may look like this is not producing the fruit.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.160]   So what I did, I mean, he asked, "What did you do, Pastor John?"
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:00.480]   I memorized and I preached to myself these words from Isaiah 55, "As the rain and the
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.660]   snow come down from heaven and do not return there, but water the earth, making it bring
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:11.980]   forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.260]   that goes forth from my mouth.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:22.040]   It will not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose and succeed
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.160]   in the thing for which I sent it."
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.920]   And I preached that to myself over and over again.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.720]   How many times did I get up from the front pew, walk toward the pulpit, saying to myself,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.480]   "It's not going to come back empty.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.560]   It's not going to come back empty."
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.240]   So we may not see the effect in this life.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.000]   Some of it God lets us see, and much of it he does not let us see.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.480]   He knows how to manage our pride, and he knows how to manage our discouragement.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   So take heart, preach the word, love the people.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   God is at work.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.520]   Yeah, that's a good word for pastors and their stability in the labors.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.440]   And thank you for the question, TJ.

[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.400]   And coming up, part two of our Providence series is up on Wednesday.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.600]   We're going to look at the affectionate side of Providence and how seeing and savoring
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.240]   this Providence awakens and sustains wonder and awe and holy reverence, and the kind of
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:43.200]   joy inside of us that leads us into true God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated worship.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.680]   Cannot wait to look at that.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   That's next time.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.180]   See you on Wednesday.
