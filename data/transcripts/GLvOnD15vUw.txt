[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.700]   Brianna writes in and says this, "I'm a 20 year old woman who by God's leading wants to live among
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.400]   unreached people groups in India or the Middle East. I've never had the desire to have my own kids,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.200]   even though I love kids, and the guy I'm currently dating doesn't either. If we get married, we see
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.480]   ourselves living as Paul-type missionaries. Practically speaking, it makes sense to not have
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.800]   kids. I've heard so many different opinions, but I want to know if biblically it is a sin to not
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   want to have kids if you're able to."
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:45.200]   First, I'm assuming that this couple is in a totally different category than the modern secular couple
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:56.120]   who have their personal dreams and consider children an inconvenience on the way to self-realization.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.520]   That, it seems to me, is very common and is sinful because God and his word are not the plumb line in
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.820]   those choices, but rather self-absorption is. I don't hear that in this question, so I'm not treating
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.520]   that issue. That's another issue. It seems to me this couple has a question much more like 1 Corinthians 7
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.720]   when Paul ponders whether singleness is advisable for himself and others. So let me draw out the
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   implications of Paul's words about spouselessness for the question of childlessness. Because I think
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.920]   the principles relating to spouselessness and childlessness are the same. So here's what Paul says,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.020]   1 Corinthians 7, "I wish all were as I myself am, namely single, but each has his own gift from God,
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.920]   one of one kind, one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.220]   remain single as I am, but if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry."
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.020]   And then he gives this reason down in verse 32, "I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.420]   is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord, but the married man is anxious
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.120]   about worldly things, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.020]   betrothed or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.820]   spirit, but the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. And I say
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.120]   this for your benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:53.020]   your undivided devotion to the Lord." Now, the reasons this is important is that Genesis 2.18
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.220]   says it's not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper fit for him. And Genesis 2.24, "Man
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.920]   shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife." So marriage is normal and good and
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   expected. And here comes Paul and he says, "Well, there are circumstances since the fall," because
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.420]   all those instructions were given before the fall, "there are circumstances since the fall in this
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.520]   redemptive era of people needing to come to Christ and much sin abounding in the world, there are
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.420]   circumstances after the fall where devotion to the Lord's work of redemption may demand unusual
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.620]   steps of devotion and singular focus." In other words, he warrants his own singleness that way,
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.620]   and he says others might take that step as well, but it's not a sin to marry. Now, I think the
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.220]   same principle applies to having children. In the beginning, before the fall, God said, "Be fruitful,
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.820]   multiply, fill the earth." That's normal, it's needed, it's the way God's purpose to fill the
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.520]   earth with worshippers is going to be fulfilled. You don't have babies, you won't fill the earth
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.620]   with the knowledge of the Lord like the waters cover the sea. But now, may we not infer, because
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.120]   of the analogy with marriage, that there are circumstances after the fall where devotion to
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.820]   the Lord's work of filling the earth with worshippers, the work of redemption, may demand
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:37.920]   unusual steps of devotion and singular focus. So my counsel would be this. Yes, for the Lord's sake,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:47.820]   and for his unusual purposes in your life, you are free to forego the normal, wonderful blessing
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:57.420]   of children. That's number one. Number two, don't make this a lifelong commitment. God may change
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.580]   the situation, and he may change your mind. You may find yourself ten years into a missionary
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.320]   situation where you thought childlessness was crucial, and discover, "No, having babies here
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.320]   would be a great help, because it would give me the kind of normal fellowship with these women,"
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.380]   for example. I mean, that's just one possible example. So whichever way you do it, for the
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.220]   name of Christ, gather children for the name of Christ. So as a single person, as a married person,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.420]   couple without children, gather children. Fill the earth with worshippers by winning worshippers,
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.120]   if not by begetting worshippers.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.620]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Brianna, for the question. If you find yourself
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.220]   drawn to international missions, but you don't know where to begin the process, we recorded an
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.720]   episode, number 236, to address this. That episode can be found in the free Ask Pastor John
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.220]   apps for the iPhone and the Android. That's episode number 236. And be sure you've updated
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.020]   your app in the last month to get all the new features that make it really easy to search and
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.320]   browse all of the almost 300 episodes that are now available in the archive. Well, it seems a
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.520]   few prominent Christians like Donald Miller have given up on the local church or find themselves
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.320]   on the verge of it. Tomorrow, I'll ask Pastor John for his thoughts. Until then, I'm your host,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520]   Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
