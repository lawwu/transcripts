[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.560]   We have a good one for you today,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.160]   an episode that will answer a question
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.760]   we get all the time in the inbox.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.480]   Basically it's this.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.480]   Is our salvation an event, or is our salvation a process?
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.540]   Are we saved in a moment,
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.000]   or are we saved in a series of unfolding events?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.520]   We need to work that out with open Bibles.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.320]   The question comes to us from Andrew,
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   a listener in Jonesboro, Arkansas, with an open Bible.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.720]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   My brother sends me questions frequently
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.760]   so we can discuss them.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.560]   The most recent one from him comes from Colossians
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.880]   chapter one, verses 21 to 23,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.300]   where it seems as if Paul is saying
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.760]   that salvation is a process, not an event.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.480]   The only reason I have an issue with this
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240]   is because he seems to think that this also indicates
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   that the once saved, always saved teaching is incorrect.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.680]   It says we aren't actually once saved,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.120]   but are more accurately continually being saved
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.520]   as we continue in the faith.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.600]   This seems contrary to the many verses
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.060]   that say salvation is by faith, not by works,
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.600]   but I still cannot completely reconcile verses
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.440]   such as these in Colossians.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.040]   What are your thoughts?
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.400]   - Well, let's read the text
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.240]   'cause we need to have the verses right there
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.880]   in front of us so that we can see
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   what the real problem is for so many people.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.840]   It goes like this.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.960]   doing evil deeds, he, Christ, has now reconciled
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.640]   in his body of flesh by his death
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   in order to present you holy and blameless
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.720]   and above reproach before him,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.080]   if indeed you continue in the faith,
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.400]   stable and steadfast,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.960]   not shifting from the hope of the gospel.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.000]   I think we need to make the problem worse
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.800]   before we make it better.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.520]   Andrew says that it looks like salvation
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.000]   is a process, not an event,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940]   and that this is what creates the problem
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.700]   of the possible loss of salvation.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.700]   But actually, salvation is an event and is a process.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.520]   Salvation, that word salvation,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.440]   and the reality behind it is the really big,
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.700]   all-encompassing word in Scripture.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.600]   It includes election, predestination,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   redemption, propitiation, divine calling,
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.940]   regeneration and reconciliation and forgiveness
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.840]   and adoption and sanctification and glorification.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.920]   I mean, it is a big, glorious word.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.480]   All of those events and processes,
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.040]   'cause some are events and some are processes,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.760]   are involved in how God saves us forever,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   and all of them are essential.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.920]   So Paul says in Ephesians 2:8,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.520]   "We have been saved."
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.940]   And he says in 1 Corinthians 1:18,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.920]   "We are being saved."
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.280]   And he says in Romans 13, 11,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.080]   "Salvation is nearer to us now
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.960]   than when we first believed."
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   So we have been, we are being, we will be saved,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.100]   event and process forever.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.080]   But that's not what makes this text
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.680]   look like salvation can be lost.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.820]   What makes it look like salvation can be lost
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.820]   is that big, daunting word if, in verse 23,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   "Now you are reconciled through his body in the flesh
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.040]   if indeed you continue in the faith,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.600]   stable and steadfast,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.140]   not shifting from the hope of the gospel."
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.640]   This is what makes so many people think,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.640]   wow, if our present condition of being reconciled
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.920]   and saved and justified and regenerated,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.000]   if our present condition is contingent,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   dependent on our persevering or continuing in faith,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.180]   then it must be true that we can lose our salvation
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.860]   for why else would there be a condition?
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.960]   Now that inference, that conclusion from the text is false.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.400]   That's not a true inference from this text,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   but it's not false because there's no condition.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.760]   There really is a condition for perseverance.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.920]   One must persevere.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.040]   The text says, "We have been reconciled
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   if we continue in the faith."
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.600]   That's a real condition.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.040]   If we don't continue in the faith,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.760]   that is, if we throw away the faith,
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.580]   renounce Jesus Christ, turn against him and his truth,
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.740]   never repent, we'll perish.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.680]   That's what John says in 1 John 2:19
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.280]   about those who fall away.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.160]   Here's the absolutely crucial thing that he says.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   "They went out from us, but they were not of us.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.200]   For if they had been of us,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.680]   they would have continued with us,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.760]   but they went out that it might become plain
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.940]   that they are not all of us."
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.840]   Two crucial things are made clear in that text.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.560]   First, if we don't persevere in faith,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   we were never truly of God and of the people of God,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.600]   never born of God.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.320]   They went out that it might be plain
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   that they were not of us, of God, of the new birth.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.180]   That is, not born of God.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.180]   Second, if we are born of God, he says,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.000]   we will persevere, we will.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.220]   If they had been of us,
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.080]   that is, among those who are born of God,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   they would have continued with us.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   So there's no thought of losing salvation,
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.000]   no thought of being born again and then being unborn again,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.120]   being justified and then being unjustified,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   having eternal life,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.240]   and then it turns out it's not eternal after all.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.160]   So the question becomes,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   how can there be a condition in Colossians 1:23
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.440]   if you can't lose your reconciliation?
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.800]   How can Paul say, "You have been reconciled
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.880]   if you persevere?"
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.720]   The answer is God uses such warnings
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.920]   to cause his children to persevere
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.300]   and he secures their perseverance.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.120]   He guarantees it by his faithfulness
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.480]   to keep us in the faith.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.620]   The Bible plainly teaches that all of those
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.620]   who are truly born again will in fact be saved.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.440]   They will meet the condition.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.600]   Consider just three passages.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.320]   So here's Romans 8:30.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.440]   I think this is the most important.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.980]   Those whom God predestined, he also called,
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.900]   and those whom he called, he also justified,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.240]   and those whom he justified, he also glorified.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.780]   This is an unbroken chain of salvation.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.180]   All the predestined are called.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.680]   All the called are justified.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.540]   All the justified are glorified.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.100]   No dropouts.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:19.100]   Eternal security of God's predestined ones
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.560]   is a biblical truth.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.280]   Here's 1 Corinthians 1, 8, and 9
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.660]   to see where it really rests, where that security rests.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.580]   Christ will sustain you to the end,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.580]   God is faithful by whom you were called
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.460]   into the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.060]   So the issue is, is God a promise keeper?
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.840]   Is he faithful?
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.760]   And here's Philippians 1, 6.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.220]   will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.660]   So what makes us eternally secure in Christ
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.780]   is not that there are no conditions
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.280]   or that salvation is not a process.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   Not a fight to be fought and a race to be run.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.120]   It is.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.440]   There are conditions.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.380]   If indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast,
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.500]   what makes us eternally secure
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   is the sovereign keeping faithfulness of God.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.040]   Peter puts it like this in 1 Peter 1, 5.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   You are being guarded by God's power through faith
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.480]   for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.320]   In other words, God's power sustains our faith
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.440]   so that we persevere and inherit
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.400]   what has been promised to us.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.140]   Here's the way Hebrews 3.14 says it.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.840]   We have come to share in Christ
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.760]   In other words, perseverance shows
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   that our original union with Christ was real.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.600]   And here's the most beautiful promise of all
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   about God's keeping his own people, Jude 1, verse 24 and 25.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.960]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.800]   and to present you blameless
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.080]   before the presence of his glory with great joy,
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.840]   to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.560]   be glory and majesty, dominion and authority
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.920]   before all time now and forevermore.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.880]   Amen.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   So yes, yes, yes, salvation is an event and a process.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.960]   Salvation is conditional upon perseverance.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.160]   Nevertheless, and this is an absolutely glorious,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.520]   nevertheless, it is completely certain,
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.600]   certain for God's predestined,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.880]   called, justified, believing children.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.920]   Therefore, all the warnings, like this one,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.400]   all the warnings of the New Testament
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.680]   are to be taken seriously
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   because God uses them to keep his children vigilant
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.560]   in the fight of faith.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.000]   We are found to be secure
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.800]   by how seriously we take all the promises
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.600]   and all the warnings of Scripture.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   - Very good.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.600]   And Andrew, thank you for the thoughtful Bible question.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.920]   We love thoughtful Bible questions.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.240]   And if you have one of your own,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.000]   send it to us by going to our online home
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.920]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.280]   Speaking of great Bible questions,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.840]   we start the week with a Great Commission Bible question.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.040]   This one, did the Apostle Paul say
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.880]   that the gospel had already reached the ends of the world
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.120]   in his own era?
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.760]   We get that sense that it did
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.360]   in Colossians chapter one and verses six and 23.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.800]   If that's what he said, it raises questions
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.320]   about our urgency with the Great Commission today.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.640]   We will look at those texts and see what John Piper says.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.940]   All the modern translations get wrong
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.800]   with them.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and Pastor John
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.640]   and I will see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
