[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   We're back with face coverings in public now mandated across most of the Bay Area, six
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760]   counties.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.080]   You probably have lingering questions.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.660]   So we know just the person to answer those questions and also to show us two more ways
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.740]   to easily make a mask using stuff you have at home.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.880]   University of San Francisco data scientist and founder of Mass4All, Jeremy Howard joins
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   us once again.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.480]   Hey Jeremy, good to see you.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.480]   Hello there.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480]   Nice to see you too.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.680]   I know, I can't wait to get to the mass making because I just think that's so useful for
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680]   many people.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.100]   But first, I would like to clarify for our viewers under what situations they need to
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.080]   wear a mask now when they're out and about in the Bay Area.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   Sure.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.640]   So let's talk about when they're absolutely required.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.480]   Yeah, so they're absolutely required both legally and practically.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.600]   They're nicely aligned, which makes it easy.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.680]   Basically whenever you're out and about except when you're exercising, not when you're at
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.480]   home and not when you're in the car with family members or on your own.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.200]   In those situations, there is no requirement under the orders to wear a mask.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   Okay.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.440]   In fact, that is, you just answered Jonathan Rose Ahmad's question.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.400]   He asked, do I need to wear a mask if I'm just going to take a walk around the neighborhood?
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.200]   Social distancing has been fine aligned along the sidewalk.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.440]   So you just said it's not necessary and of course it's not legally required.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.840]   But should you, I mean, could it be extra beneficial given what happens when you're
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   exercising?
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.640]   You know, I mean, it depends how cautious you want to be.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.240]   I haven't been able to find any documented cases in the scientific literature of transmission
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.760]   occurring in that situation.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.420]   Transmission outside in general is about 20 times less common than transmission indoors.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.880]   And the transmission that does tend to occur outside tends to be things like sports events,
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.680]   Mardi Gras, sing-alongs, lots of people getting together and making a lot of noise.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.600]   But, you know, again, if you want to be careful, you may as well, particularly if it's not
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.320]   like, if it's not windy, if you're sitting close to somebody outside for a while, those
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.440]   kinds of situations, you may as well be careful.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.160]   Personally, when I'm jogging, I try to make sure I'm not jogging right behind somebody,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.240]   so I'm not kind of in their slip strain.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.800]   And of course, I try to make sure that there's a six-feet distance whenever I'm passing by,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.440]   so I try to kind of wave and find a way to navigate with people so that we all stay out
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   of each other's way.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   That's right.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.080]   You know, I do want to ask you because I see a new survey by True Public out today that
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.940]   shows 29 percent of Americans refuse to wear a mask when they leave the home.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.800]   But that does mean two-thirds are now either doing it all the time or open to the idea.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.240]   Do you consider actually that's a pretty big shift in attitude about one month?
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   I'm Australian-born, I'm now based in San Francisco.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.320]   Honestly, I never thought this would happen in my lifetime.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.640]   I never used to wear a mask.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   I never cared about masks until I studied the science around this.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.480]   And if you had asked me, would people in America be wearing masks like more than half or more
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.520]   than half talking about it, I'd be like, "No way that's going to happen," but turns out
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.240]   when our lives are on the line, we can change our behavior.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   Absolutely.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.920]   And I think there's still some confusion over the purpose of a mask, right?
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   Right.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.720]   Is it that when we wear one, we're protecting ourselves or are we protecting others?
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.000]   Well, you've set up a nice, sick way here, Kristen.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.320]   So the basic mask is largely about protecting other people.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   Here's the thing.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.560]   When you're breathing in a mask, it actually creates a little humid atmosphere in that
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.680]   tiny space in front of your mouth.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.600]   And the droplets that come out of your mouth stay big enough to be captured by the cloth
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.760]   mask.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.120]   So that works really well.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.000]   So that means that if you're infected and don't know it, and remember, half of infections
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080]   come from people that are infected and don't know it, you can protect other people from
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.200]   your possibly infectious droplets by wearing a mask.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.140]   It helps protect you a bit as well, but not as much because if somebody around you doesn't
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.960]   have a mask on and they're breathing or talking, the droplets come out and they evaporate.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.000]   And after they evaporate, they become so small that to catch them requires some special tricks
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   which I can show you if you're interested.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   Right.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.960]   Which we can do ourselves with those special tricks because you want to leave them at 95s
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.200]   that filter them out for the medical professionals.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.760]   They are most exposed on the front lines.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.320]   I want to fold in a question from a viewer, Lilly and Padua Marquez.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.120]   She's asking how about shared rides like Lyft or Uber?
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.480]   Do we need to wear a mask as well when we're taking care of those?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.560]   Both legally and practically.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.600]   So those workers that are giving you that ride, they're super at risk, right?
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.720]   And you're sitting there in an enclosed space with them.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.440]   They're seeing lots of people every day.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   Please keep them protected by wearing a mask.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.680]   And that is required under the Bay Area requirements.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   Okay.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.760]   And Randy wants to know, are masks required to be worn by customers in a California state
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   building?
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.320]   Now, this is interesting, right?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.040]   Because there are some California state buildings that are not in the counties here that are
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.120]   requiring them.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   So the state doesn't have a ban.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.000]   I mean, I'm leaving out without a mask.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Right.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.520]   Governor Newsom has kind of dropped the ball at this point.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   A lot of states are requiring masks.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.040]   And both Republican and Democratic governors are getting behind this important safety issue.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.240]   For whatever reason, Governor Newsom is not being as progressive as we usually see on
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.020]   these kinds of issues where we're not following the science yet.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.000]   And I really hope to see that change.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Okay.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.520]   So basically, if you're in a state building that's not in one of the cities covered by
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.200]   county order, then you actually don't have to, although you would say you should.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   As far as I know, there's nothing special protecting state buildings outside of areas
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.720]   like the Bay Area and Santa Cruz and other places that are doing it themselves, despite
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.200]   the governor's inaction.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.040]   What about the continued thought that, look, if you don't wear it right, if you don't
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.120]   wear it correctly, if you're futzing with it all the time, or you put it down on a surface
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.920]   that's contaminated, it's actually potentially more harmful for you.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.680]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are saying that, but my reaction is like, come on, think about
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   it, right?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.240]   Like, if there's virus particles in your mask, but if two things has happened, either you're
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.560]   infected, in which case, too late, right?
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.240]   Or somebody infected around you, the mask has stopped the droplets, they're now on your
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.400]   mask and not in your mouth.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.560]   This is a respiratory disease, you get sick if it goes into your mouth, into your nose
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.360]   or into your eyes, not onto the top of your mask, or even on your hands, right?
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.560]   I mean, be a bit careful, take it off from the side, put it in some soapy water, but
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.600]   at this point, I've studied so many scientific papers, I haven't yet found a single example
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.240]   of transmission through cloth, so it's a pretty speculative issue anyway.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.040]   It's certainly not more risky than the virus going into your face, which is literally how
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   people get sick.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.240]   Okay, well, you've got me convinced, Jeremy, so what we're going to do in the next segment
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.580]   after a short break is we're going to mind the gap.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.040]   You know the gap that comes around when you make your own face covering, so we're going
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.680]   to figure out how to cover that, and it's not that hard.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.640]   I call this leveling up your mask, we're going to level up our mask.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   Okay, sounds good.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.040]   We'll take a short break on the air, but of course, you can continue the conversation
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.480]   with us over on our live streams, and we'll be back with mask making with Jeremy Howard.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:29.120]   All right, so folks, Jeremy and I are going to show you how to make two types of masks,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.740]   so what I want you to do, and Jeremy, you can pipe in, is get some sort of, if you have
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.880]   a mask or a covering, a homemade one, or even like a cloth, go grab it, and if you have
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.280]   foil, go grab it, tin foil, something like that, a wire.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.240]   Or a coffee filter foil, or just aluminium foil is fine.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.560]   And then get three rubber bands, I've already tied my three together.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.400]   Biggish ones, not too small.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.120]   Not too small, okay, right, well, I had that problem earlier, I didn't think my face was
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.840]   that big, but the rubber bands didn't fit, so I had to grab a bigger or a center one,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.520]   and then, Jeremy, you also recommend getting a pair of glasses, right, because of the eyes,
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.600]   you want to protect the eyes.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.440]   Yep, sunglasses are fine.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.760]   Okay, so folks, if you also have time, and if you have paper towels, grab a paper towel,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.320]   because that's another method in a pinch, and then a couple more rubber bands, and if
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.040]   you're doing that one, staples, please.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.040]   Staples, staples, which Jeremy doesn't have, yeah, staples, exactly, they're quick, they're
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.560]   easy, and there's certainly a lot, you know, better than no protection, also, if you live
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.040]   in one of the six counties in the Bay Area that now recover, not recover, sorry, require
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.460]   face coverings, then you'll want to have one handy.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.160]   Now, Jeremy, I wonder if you're seeing stores yet locally that are just handing you a mask
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   as you go in.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.000]   Are you seeing that in this country, because I've seen that in some of the countries?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.040]   Not in this country, a lot of countries do, you know, there's some great video online
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.840]   showing how Austria is doing this in every store, there's somebody at the front handing
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.000]   out masks to everybody coming in, but I haven't seen it yet around here, I don't know if any
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.600]   of the folks watching have, that would be so cool, really, that would be like such a great
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.200]   customer safety focus for ourself to do that.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.460]   Alright, let us know on Facebook if you've seen a store or a facility that's just handing
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:22.760]   out masks as you enter, alright, we'll come you back on in.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.120]   And we are back with the University of San Francisco researcher, data scientist, and
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.520]   mask for all founder, Jeremy Howard. Alright, Jeremy, we promise folks that we're going
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.760]   to just take a few quick minutes and show people how to make a face covering more effective,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   mind the gap, if you will, so let's go ahead and get to work.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.280]   I love it, mind the gap, I wish I'd invented that, I'm stealing it, it's great.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   Okay, feel free.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.960]   Alright, shall we create the gap first, with the gap-y one?
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   Yep.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.440]   So this is my mother-in-law mask, she's a genius, and she's created this lovely mask,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.960]   which in the default setting, we're going to have the gap, you want to see the gap?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.400]   Yes, yes, let me see it.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.920]   I will try and do this without destroying my home studio.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.200]   Ah, I see, I see, I believe my nose is flatter and therefore the gap is smaller, but yes,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   I still have one.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.680]   Yes, I mean it's true, you know, the nose is something I have and it's a sign of a,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.840]   you know, a great gentleman I hear.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   It truly is.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.360]   So what do we do about it?
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.720]   Aluminum, I will try and use the American, aluminum foil, I literally just cut it out
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.000]   and folded it up, and you can use a coffee filter, you can see how nice and moldable
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   this is?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.040]   So my genius mother-in-law has put this little slip in here for me, now if you don't have
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.320]   a genius mother-in-law, I don't, I mean my mother-in-law is a genius, but she didn't
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   sew one for me.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.880]   Yeah, careful, then just pop it in here, or else just use tape, stick it onto whatever
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.480]   you're using, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.680]   And the thing is, this is actually what surgical masks have in, I think they might use something
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:04.080]   more advanced than foil, but it does the same thing, because now, what I do after I pop
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:14.920]   this on is I just push, pop, right, onto my distinguished nose, and now, yeah, much less
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   of a gap.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   It's not perfect, but it's a lot better, right?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I get it, so that's better protection, you may have that sealed.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.160]   Okay, so you want to level up another level?
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.560]   I do.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.280]   Okay, so an apple engineer, an ex-apple engineer invented this, here are three rubber bands
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.640]   that I've literally just, you know, hooked into each other, and what I do is I put the
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.800]   middle one around my fingers, and put it over the top, this is really important, over the
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.480]   top, sorry, under the top of your mask, and then you can either do it under your, depending
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.280]   on how big it is, under your chin or under your mouth, and then behind one ear, and then
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:02.520]   swap hands, behind the other ear, and then what I do is I kind of like push the fabric
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.380]   in so that it's like squishes.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.880]   What does that do?
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.000]   It just means it doesn't fall out so much, you know, otherwise I'd kind of have to stick
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.640]   my lip out or get Botox or something, which isn't quite my thing.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.320]   Well, there's nowhere to get it right now, so don't do that.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   Fair enough.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.360]   Now, have a look at this.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   Okay.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.640]   Oh, yep, I see, now you have kind of formed a tight seal around the mouth area and the
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.760]   nose area.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   So there's actually very few spots for the air to come in now, and so doctors do a breath
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.880]   test at this point to kind of feel that when you breathe out, you know, are you feeling
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.000]   air coming out.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:55.440]   And this is actually, you know, it's nowhere 95, and you know, one key thing actually is
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:02.080]   if somebody around me has been, you know, rude enough to not wear a mask, they can infect
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.640]   me because these droplet nuclei that evaporate out spread in the air.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.160]   I have stopped them from coming in a lot to the holes, but they could come straight through
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   the fabric.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   Right, so what do you do?
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.600]   So what I do to stop that is the genius mother-in-law I mentioned, thank you, Linda, has created
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:25.120]   a nice pocket for me here to put this wonderful nanomaterial, which under an electron microscope
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.880]   looks very, very much almost the same as the inner layer of surgical masks, and it's called
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880]   a paper towel.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   Okay.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.600]   And actually somebody at the National Academy of Sciences with the laser chamber helped
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   me with this.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.680]   And he found that the, you know, the nice thick kind of bounty paper towels, just one of them
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.500]   does a 99% good job of stopping the droplets when they come out, and they should do a pretty
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.240]   good job of stopping the nuclei when they come in as well.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   That's fantastic.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   Okay.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.200]   So I wanted to ask you if we have one minute left to show me the other method, which is
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   with the paper towel.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.440]   So as I mentioned, I'm too poor to have a stapler here, so I have to sticky tape it.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   This is just a piece of that magic paper towel that I've got, you know, just staple a rubber
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.680]   band onto each end.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.920]   Okay, I'll do it.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:15.280]   And then get the piece of foil out, which of course, now that I'm on TV, it's not going
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.280]   to come out for me.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.960]   So I'll get the piece of foil out, here it comes, and pop it, you know, the nice thing
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.000]   about these pieces of paper towel nowadays is that they have the fold in the middle.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Yep.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.520]   So we can just take the foil, pop it in the middle, like so, okay?
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:43.240]   And then pop it, mold it, and then over each ear.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.400]   And then the only other thing I would say for both of these cases...
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   All right.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.760]   Hey Jeremy, we've got to finish this up on our live stream because they're out of time
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.760]   on the air.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.760]   Okay, please put glasses on as well because they can come through your eyes.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.720]   So the website is massforall.co, right?
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   Yeah, with the number four.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   The number four.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   Okay.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   Go check us out on the live stream.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   Thank you.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   Okay.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.560]   All right, Jeremy, we're still on Facebook, so we've got a few minutes, a couple minutes.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.680]   So I didn't do the wire for there.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.160]   I still need to either tape that or just put it in the middle, right between the ears.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   Yeah, just chuck it in the middle.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   That worked for me, yep.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.520]   It doesn't really fall down because at least my nose gets in the way sufficiently.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.520]   All right.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.440]   So a lot of people are asking, could you use, you know, coffee filter?
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   Yep.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   What else works?
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   You know, name all the things that you could use.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.040]   Those are the two I'm aware of.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.800]   You know, a lot of people say microfiber cloth, I haven't studied it, but it sounds sensible
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   to me.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.640]   You know, anything with a nice tight wave, but you know, anybody can get paper towel,
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   I hope.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   Yeah, no.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:52.120]   Do you have any idea, do we have any studies as to what percentage of people are complying
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.000]   in the places that do have these mask orders?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.080]   Yeah, we do.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.880]   It's increasing rapidly, obviously it varies by jurisdiction, but there are places in the
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.280]   US that are up to 70, 80% now.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.240]   And that's even, some of those even without laws in place.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.360]   So people are doing a great job of protecting their communities, I think it shows a lot
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   of care.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.640]   Yeah, I mean, I always think it's kind of strange when it becomes sort of a political
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.120]   statement because health and politics should be completely separate.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.280]   But that does seem to be the case, if you look at what happened on the House floor today,
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.760]   as House members were debating the relief bill, it seemed that most of the Democratic
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.040]   members had their masks on and they will pull it down to speak and many of the Republicans
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.160]   were not wearing them.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   So-
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   Well, there's Republican senators like Senator Toomey and governors like Larry Hogan that
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.560]   are coming out strong pro-masks, so it's not entirely partisan.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.040]   Yeah, I'm hoping that it's not partisan, right?
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   Health when it comes to health, it's everybody's attached together.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   And the economy.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.600]   All right, great information, great tricks and tips.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   It was fun to talk with you, Jeremy.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   She is.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   All right.
