[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   In Ask Pastor John episode 98, we saw over 27,000 plays to the question, "Can a white
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.360]   woman marry a black man?"
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.760]   It's now the most listened to episode of all time, and of course the obvious answer to
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.920]   most listeners is yes, of course she can marry a black man as long as he loves Christ.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.920]   And yet for the obvious answer, a lot of people wanted to hear why.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.920]   Pastor John, what's your take on the popularity of this episode on interracial marriage and
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.680]   why do you think so many people clicked to listen to what should have been a fairly obvious
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.680]   answer?
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.240]   Well, since we've asked that question, Tony, I have been thinking more and more about it.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.440]   I've been on three different occasions people have asked me why I think that, and so here's
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   my latest take on this.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.000]   Number one, your title, I think, was really good.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.480]   You didn't say in a blah, general, vague way, "What do you think, Pastor John, about interracial
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   marriage?"
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.740]   I think that would not have gotten the traction.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.240]   You said, "Can a white woman marry a black man?"
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.400]   That's really specific.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.360]   So it's provocative in that sense.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.360]   That's number one.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.080]   Number two, cultural and legal opposition to interracial marriage in America, black/white
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.000]   in particular, is recent history.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.680]   When I graduated from high school, 17 states had anti-miscegenation laws, which means you
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.880]   can't.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   You go to jail if you marry a black or a white woman across a line, any kind of man or woman
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   interracial marriage.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.480]   And then in 1967, the Supreme Court struck all those down, and not all of them willingly.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.120]   So in my lifetime, it was illegal.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   So this is recent history.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.360]   Nearly any 20-something who wants to get married, his grandparents lived during that, maybe
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.680]   even his parents.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   So the racism that lay behind that and the deep wounds, I mean, can you imagine the woundedness
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.560]   of being in a minority and the majority says, "We won't let our people marry you."
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.880]   I mean, that communicates such dagger assault on a person's sense of humanity that those
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.360]   wounds and that racism are, I think, still alive.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.640]   That's number two.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   It's fresh.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.920]   Number three, today, it's not just white racism that opposes white/black marriage.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   Blacks, many blacks, not all, many blacks oppose it for different reasons.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.960]   This is part of a bigger phenomenon right now of a sense in some of the black community
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   of losing our cultural cohesion that once enabled us to do so many great things in the
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.360]   movement with a capital M in the '60s and so on.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   And Toure, that's what he's known by now, his name is Toure Neblett, wrote a book that
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.940]   I've read parts of called "Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness?"
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.960]   And his whole point is there isn't any black cohesive culture anymore, if there ever was.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.440]   And he means there are lots of black cultures.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.920]   There's lots of socioeconomic blacks, there's lots of culturally differentiated blacks,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.120]   there's lots of religious blacks and so on.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.840]   And so his point is that idea of there being a black culture to be lost is just not true.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.320]   And some people feel that is a huge disappointment.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:08.040]   In other words, the glory days, as some would say, of the '60s and the '50s are over because
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.640]   we're losing our cohesion.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.520]   And when you have a person who thinks that, look at a black/white marriage, they say,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   "There it goes.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   There it goes."
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:26.160]   It's a sacrifice of the black cohesiveness if a black is "selling out" to marry a white
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.440]   person.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.920]   So that's a piece of this that might make it especially interesting or urgent for some
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   people.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.320]   And by the way, it's really not by the way, it's right at the heart of things, this is
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.020]   just a golden opportunity for the gospel, isn't it?
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:50.960]   As black and white and brown and Asian, as everybody is struggling with the new faces
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.400]   of ethnic identity today, this is a moment for Christ to step in and say, "I'm creating
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.000]   a new humanity from all these ethnicities, and I am your identity."
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.400]   So here's number four.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.200]   There is lurking, I believe, in lots of people a remaining sense that the Bible really is
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   against interracial marriage.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.560]   Because, well, God is sovereign and he ordained that races be, why would we want to start
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.400]   to smooth them out by having people marry and then their children don't look like either
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   of them anymore and you don't have the same integrity of the race?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.240]   Wouldn't God be in favor of preserving all those races since he ordained them?
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.000]   And you people are all intermarrying and turning everybody into one generic kind.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.720]   That's a question that people would have.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.600]   And the Old Testament forbade Israel from marrying outside Israel, so it looks like
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.280]   God is in favor of ethnic integrity.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.960]   So I think, I tried to address those in the original APJ, so I'm not going to do it here,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.980]   but that's still there when people read their Bible, I think.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.060]   And the last one is, and this may be the most down-to-earth, on-the-ground practical, parents
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.660]   want their children to succeed in marriage.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.860]   They don't want them to get divorced because of irresolvable differences.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:25.740]   And everybody who's been married 10 years knows, I've been married 44, knows that all
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.220]   marriage is hard.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.620]   All marriages, I laughingly say, are cross-cultural.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.700]   I mean, I married a woman from Georgia, for goodness sakes, and I'm from South Carolina,
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.700]   so that's cross-cultural.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.600]   Or, actually, I could describe a lot of other differences, but every marriage is cross-cultural,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.140]   and when you add a racial divide to that, parents feel inside, "You're making it harder
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.020]   for yourself because they're going to bring these different expectations and different
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.900]   differences," even if they're not opposed to racial intermingling in and of itself.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.020]   There's this kind of check in their spirit about, "Oh, you're going to make life harder
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:10.300]   for yourself," and so there's this resistance, and that can quickly be intermingled with
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.060]   racial prejudice of various kinds.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:21.260]   So I think those, at least five so far, in my thinking, Tony, those are the nerves that
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.540]   we touched when we did this.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.780]   And I would say one more time, every one of those five are a golden moment for the gospel
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.980]   of Jesus Christ to address all of these things, and that's what I tried to do in "Bloodlines,"
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.780]   especially in the chapter on interracial marriage.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.700]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast at DesiringGod.org.
