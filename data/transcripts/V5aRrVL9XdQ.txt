[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.300]   - Pastor John, is it necessary for a Christian man
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.120]   in his divine calling to protect his wife and children
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.480]   to own and be willing to use a gun?
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.740]   Yes or no?
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.940]   - Yes or no?
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.040]   That would be a short.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.700]   (both laughing)
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.900]   No.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.740]   Are we done?
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.800]   - Oh no, you're not done.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.920]   - No, we're not done.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.160]   I've got a lot, I've got thoughts about this.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.040]   There are at least four reasons
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   I would discourage people from owning firearms
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.240]   for the purpose of self-defense.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.120]   I'm not talking about hunters here, okay?
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.380]   Leave that for another issue.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.840]   The conclusion I come to here,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.480]   I don't put on everyone else.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.320]   I'm bearing testimony here, not prescribing, okay?
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.080]   I'm telling people why I do what I do
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.000]   and see whether it commends itself to them.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.620]   Here are the reasons.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.320]   My human heart, or I could say the human heart,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.560]   is vengeful and quick to anger.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.440]   James 4 tells me this is really bad.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.940]   Be slow to anger, quick to listen.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.560]   I don't think I'm holy enough to own a gun
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   and use it in a Christ-honoring way.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.680]   I am really quick to think payback,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.540]   and that's unbiblical and unchristian,
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.080]   and I have to subdue it,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.720]   and I don't want a gun in my hand
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.880]   while I'm making that battle.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   Number two, the culture around me
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.360]   with movies and TV shows and humorists and literature
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.320]   is shot through with the glorification
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   of cool, hard, tough-talking, tough-acting women and men
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.080]   who have a kind of unflappable, cocky swagger
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.240]   that gets the last word and has the last shot.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.480]   It is ubiquitous.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   This is a ubiquitous hero in our culture
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   and is anything but childlike,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.560]   anything but humbly reliant on the grace of God
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.200]   and the rescue of a Savior.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.960]   That's the air we breathe in the media,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.660]   and it's not the Spirit of Christ.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.480]   When that is the attitude breaking in on my soul every day,
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.760]   the last thing I need is a gun in my hand.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.720]   That's number two.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.540]   Number three, Jesus and the apostles discourage us
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.040]   from preparing ourselves to return evil for evil.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.280]   Instead, they push us toward being wronged
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160]   rather than being violent.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.440]   Matthew 5:39, "Do not resist the one who is evil,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.560]   "but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.000]   "turn to him the other also.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.840]   "If anyone would sue you and take your tunic,
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.640]   "let him have your cloak as well.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.840]   "If anyone forces you to go one mile,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.980]   "go with him two miles."
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.860]   Matthew 10, "Behold, I send you out as sheep
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.280]   "in the midst of wolves,
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.420]   "not packing sheep.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.420]   "Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves."
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.800]   Romans 12, "Repay no one evil for evil."
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.120]   First Thessalonians, "No one evil for evil."
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.240]   First Peter, "No one evil for evil."
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   Now, I know, Tony, that these same texts
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.900]   would be used to say you shouldn't use your fists either,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   as just the same as applying them to guns.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.960]   So the person would ask me,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.620]   "So, are you saying don't do anything
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.280]   "to protect yourself or your family?"
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   And my answer is, these texts describe a real way
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.160]   of loving people and glorifying
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.120]   the all-satisfying, all-sufficient Christ.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.060]   They are one form that love takes,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.160]   a very powerful form,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.520]   a form that Jesus chose almost all the time,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.240]   a form of love that we don't have enough of.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.480]   I don't have enough of in my heart,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.120]   and we don't have enough of in the world.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.960]   Our flesh is all wired and hair-triggered
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.160]   to go the other direction than these texts.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.400]   But these texts are not the only form of love.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280]   Love may protect a child,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.320]   may protect a wife with a physical struggle.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.040]   Here's what I'm saying.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.720]   I'm saying, in quoting those texts,
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.480]   it's the spirit of those texts
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.420]   that disinclines me from arming myself
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.180]   so that I can do the quickest
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.120]   and most deadly harm in self-defense.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.840]   These passages don't sound like an arming spirit.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.040]   So that's number three.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.200]   And here's the last one, number four.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.300]   When Peter pulled his gun on the high priest
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.700]   in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.700]   and shot off the high priest's servant's ear,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.260]   and Jesus picked up the ear and put it back on,
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.380]   what did Jesus say at that point?
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.180]   'Cause I think what he says really matters.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.100]   He didn't say, "Hey, Peter, we've been through this before.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.780]   "I am here to die, and you are missing the whole point.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.920]   "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.760]   He didn't say that.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.960]   He said that earlier.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.740]   What he said was a proverb, a maxim,
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.320]   that he applies in this situation.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.040]   He said, "Put your sword back in its place,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.620]   "for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.800]   That's a little proverb,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.880]   and proverbs have a general truth.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.760]   They're not absolute, not everybody to the last man,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.120]   but it's a general truth.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.720]   All who take the sword will perish by the sword.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.000]   So what does he mean?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.440]   I think he means something like,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.720]   "The mindset that plans to save its life by killing
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.780]   "is not inviting the protection of God,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.040]   "but the violence of man."
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.680]   I think that's what Jesus means when he says,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.080]   "All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.120]   The mindset that plans to save its life by killing
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.080]   is not inviting the protection of God,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.520]   but the violence of man.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.760]   So, Tony, my response to, for what it's worth,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.520]   and this is testimony, not prescription,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.720]   has been to live in the inner city of Minneapolis
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.800]   for 33 years, raise five children there,
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.960]   surrounded by petty crimes and some gunshots
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.580]   and a little bit of a break-in,
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.580]   and never to possess a firearm, nor do I ever intend to.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.000]   God has protected us, and I believe he will,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   but as I see it now, I would rather be killed
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.800]   than to kill.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.560]   For me, that would mean instant joy,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   but if I killed him, it might be instant hell.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.100]   I'm ready, and he may not be.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.840]   - That is a very sobering perspective on it all.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.420]   And I can imagine we will be getting some follow-up questions
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.040]   about nonlethal force, and so if you wanna ask Pastor John
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.880]   questions about rubber bullets or tasers,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.680]   please email those questions or any questions to us
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.240]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.040]   We'll be back tomorrow to ask whether or not
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.960]   there's such thing as free will.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
