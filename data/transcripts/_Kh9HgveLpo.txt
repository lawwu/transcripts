[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.720]   the Gospel according to St. John, in chapter 4, reading from verse 27 to verse 30.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.160]   And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with a woman.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.080]   Yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.400]   The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.160]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.040]   Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.400]   We are continuing our study of this statement, and particularly the 28th verse.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.000]   The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.440]   Then we are told what she said to the men in the city.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.960]   Now this is of interest and of importance to us because it describes the condition of
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.520]   this woman, her state and condition, after her amazing conversation with our blessed
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.520]   Lord and Savior.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.680]   And in particular, after he had said to her, I that speak unto thee am he, in reference
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.840]   to the coming Messiah.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.800]   Now we are concerned about this because, as I say, here is a picture of what the Christian
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.000]   life is meant to be, what the Christian life can be.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.120]   Here is a woman whose entire life is changed.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.840]   From following her tasks and living in the way which she did, she suddenly now finds
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.600]   herself controlled entirely by this person whom she has met.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960]   That is why she leaves her water pot.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.760]   These things can wait.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.960]   There is one dominating thought in her mind, and that is this person and her desire that
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.920]   everybody should come and see him and meet him, and hear what he has got to say.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.120]   Now this, I say, is the description in this pictorial, interesting manner, of what the
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.560]   Christian life is meant to be.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.760]   You remember how our Lord put it.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.200]   Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.240]   that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   Now this is it.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.920]   This is the thing that we should all not only be aware of, but the thing that we should
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.860]   know in experience.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.240]   This is something experimental.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.640]   This is not hyperbole.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.740]   This is our Lord's own way of describing, as he does in many other ways, this fullness
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.720]   of life that he has come to give to his people.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.840]   Now what we are trying to look at at the moment is, as you realize, most of you, that according
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   to the Scriptures it is as possible for us to realize the presence of our Lord as it
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.960]   was for the woman of Samaria.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   She saw him in the days of his flesh.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   But if we are ever going to put ourselves into the position of saying that the people
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.840]   who were on earth while he was here in the days of his flesh have a great advantage over
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.920]   everybody else who have ever lived ever since, well then we are really denying the very essence
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.720]   of the Christian faith and denying our Lord's own explicit statements.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.320]   Let us never forget that it was he himself who said, "It is expedient for you that I
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.760]   go away."
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.360]   Something bigger, greater was to happen to them after his departure.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.440]   And of course we have this abundant evidence in the case of the apostles themselves that
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.400]   that proved to be the case.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   While he was with them, they were full of doubts and hesitations and uncertainties.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.760]   They were constantly stumbling, stumbling by what he said to them, stumbling at what
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.200]   happened to them.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.960]   But after his resurrection and ascension and descending of the Holy Spirit on the day of
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.840]   Pentecost, there is a tremendous change.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.600]   They are different men and they are living a life of joy, exhilaration, and of victory.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   Now that is the picture that we should always have in our minds.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.320]   We must not again say that the first Christians, the Christians of the first century, had a
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.240]   great advantage over all the rest of the Christians in subsequent centuries.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   That is really to deny the faith at its most delicate and sensitive point.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.800]   We must never allow ourselves to say that or to reduce the great teaching of the New
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.680]   Testament down to the level of our experiences.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.200]   It must be the other way around.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.120]   These scriptures are given to us in order that we may realize what is possible for us.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.000]   Otherwise, I say, the Christian message is more or less a mockery.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.120]   So we have got to start with this great realization.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.200]   And to that end, I have been giving you the scriptures to show you how these things are
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   promised to Christian people at all times and in all places.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.560]   Man in his original creation knew God, and he had an intimate and a direct fellowship
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.920]   with him.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.200]   You read that in the early chapters of Genesis.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   And he then fell in his folly.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.140]   And what was the main effect of the fall?
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.440]   It was that men lost his knowledge of God and his fellowship with God and his communion
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.560]   with God.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.200]   And the Lord Jesus Christ has come into the world to give us salvation, redemption.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   What's that?
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.120]   Well, it is ultimately to restore us to the knowledge of God.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.240]   That is the chief end of salvation, to bring us back to the knowledge of God that men lost
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.680]   in their sin and rebellion and in the fall.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.120]   Now, this, you see, being the very central object of salvation, we must realize that
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.240]   this is the thing which we should always be aiming at and which we should always be seeking.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.040]   And as I have been able to show you, that is the whole teaching of the scriptures.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.920]   And then somebody may say, "Ah, yes, but again, that's only something that was to
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.160]   happen until we'd got the scriptures, and now we just live on the scriptures."
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.000]   I gave you evidence from subsequent ages, and I could have given you very much more
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   evidence.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I simply picked out some.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.240]   I've often given you other quotations showing the same thing.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.360]   But now we must go on with this, because having established it, a question that people are
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.760]   always very ready to ask, and it's a question that should be asked, is this.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.680]   How then does he manifest himself now to Christian people?
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.800]   He has promised to do so.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   He has said, "I will manifest myself unto him."
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   How does he do so?
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.080]   Here is a question that has perplexed many people, and of course, in many ways, it is
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.320]   a subject that is surrounded with certain dangers.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.960]   There is nothing in this Christian life or teaching about that it is surrounded with
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   dangers.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.720]   That's because of the devil, and that's because of the effect of sin and the fall
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.880]   upon us, every one of us.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.320]   People sometimes go off on a tangent.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.280]   Many have done so and have sought visions and have imagined things and have confused
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.720]   the psychological with the psychic and the spiritual.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.560]   All right, but because there are difficulties and dangers, we are not to avoid the subject
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   altogether.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   Quite the reverse.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.480]   That should urge us to examine it scripturally, carefully, and in the light of help that we
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.320]   are given by the saints throughout the centuries.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.480]   There is nothing so fatal, it seems to me, as the tendency that is so evident at the
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:55.240]   present time, because of certain possible dangers, to have nothing as it were to do
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   with the subject.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.280]   There are people who are so afraid of excesses that they have really never had much evidence
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   of life in them.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.360]   As I have often pointed out, it is not difficult to keep order in a cemetery, but when you
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.800]   have got a house full of children, you have got a problem.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.600]   And I prefer the problems of a house full of children to the dead, legalistic orderliness
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.240]   of people who are afraid of excesses and afraid of enthusiasm and of ecstasy.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.040]   Well, don't be troubled by that.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.560]   But I say this because it is important that we should consider and have some clear idea
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.760]   in our minds as to what we can legitimately expect and, indeed, what we can legitimately
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   seek in this respect.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.320]   Well now, how does he manifest himself?
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   The answer is, of course, that it is spiritual manifestation.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320]   Spiritual manifestations.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.000]   Here, this woman sees him literally in the flesh.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   We don't seek that.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.120]   We seek spiritual manifestations.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.800]   And what are they like?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:17.320]   Well let me quote you the saintly John Fletcher of Medley, who knew so much about this.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:24.480]   He says, "The tongues of men and angels want proper words to express the sweetness
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:32.120]   and the glory with which the Son of God visits the soul that cannot rest without him."
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.480]   I'll read that again.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:42.880]   "The tongues of men and angels want proper words to express the sweetness and glory with
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.360]   which the Son of God visits the soul that cannot rest without him."
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   Now that last phrase is one that I shall have to open up later on.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.360]   It is to the people who cannot rest without him that he does manifest himself.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.920]   But what Fletcher is emphasizing here is that the manifestations are such that words are
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   inadequate.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.520]   So he goes on to put it like this.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.840]   He says it's not to be described, but to be enjoyed.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.640]   There is something, of course, that transcends all human ability to describe.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.340]   It's comparable to what we saw when we were looking at Paul's experience as described
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.680]   in 2 Corinthians 12, beyond description.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.720]   Now you'd expect this, and we must expect this.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.840]   There is nothing so fatal as to try to confine what is possible to us in the Christian life
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.000]   to our understanding and to our terminology.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.440]   Now let me use an illustration to show clearly what I'm referring to.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:00.320]   People are often troubled by questions as to what heaven is going to be like.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.400]   I suppose I've had questions concerning that as frequently as any other question.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.840]   They want to know what it's like and what will happen there, and so on.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.480]   And they're a bit troubled at the fact that we are not told very much about this in the
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   Scriptures.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.880]   But you know, you shouldn't be surprised at that.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.360]   The explanation is perfectly simple.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:29.880]   The glory of heaven is such that our language at its best and at its highest is inevitably
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.200]   bound to detract from it.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.080]   It's bound to do so.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   Take the word love.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:44.240]   However nobly you may conceive of love, it falls almost infinitely short of what love
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.760]   really is, for God is love.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.920]   But you see, you and I can't use the word love without of necessity its carrying certain
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.560]   human, carnal, even sinful implications with it.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.500]   And so when you come to consider the glory of a lost thing, when you come to consider
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:10.560]   heaven, it is so glorious that our highest and our best language is quite inadequate.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.960]   And I believe that that is why in the kindness and the goodness of God we are not told more
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   than we are told, because it's impossible to describe it.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.480]   We are told enough to make us realize that it is something infinite in its glory, in
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.440]   its perfection, and in its joy.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.400]   We are told that, but we can't be given detailed descriptions.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.560]   You see, the nearest the Scriptures come to it is to say that the streets are paved with
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   gold.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   Now that's imagery.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.720]   That's not literal description.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.960]   It's in the book of Revelation, the book of images, and of imagery and of symbols.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.320]   But this is just an attempt by taking the categories of men.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.880]   Gold is regarded as so wonderful that there's nothing beyond that.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.160]   But you see, it's totally inadequate in a sense.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.480]   It's simply to give us some vague notion and idea.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.840]   Well now, that is precisely what John Fletcher of Medley is saying in these words that he
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.960]   here uses.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.120]   And of course, it follows from this that you've got terms implied in the Scriptures.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:24.000]   I read two portions from the book of Revelation this morning, one in chapter 2 and one in
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.640]   chapter 3, in order that I might remind you of these terms.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:41.520]   You remember what we were told in that letter there to the church at Pergamon, this interesting
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:51.160]   statement here, "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna."
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.400]   The church at Pergamon.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   The hidden manna?
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:03.080]   Now, the very term, you see, explains to us exactly what this kind of experience is.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.120]   It is manna, as manna was given to the children of Israel.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.680]   That was food from heaven.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   That was miraculous.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   That was something nobody could explain, but it satisfied them in the wilderness when they
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.760]   had no food to eat.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.280]   But this is a hidden manna, which means that there's an element of mystery about it, and
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.720]   there is.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.080]   It is something strange, it is something unusual.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:34.800]   Our Lord, as we have seen in this connection with the woman of Samaria, he tells the disciples
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   that he has food to eat of that they know not of.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.640]   I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.960]   Same kind of idea.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.200]   Now, this is the hidden manna.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.800]   Or the other expression, which we found in the case of the church at Philadelphia was
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.600]   the new name.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.720]   I will give him a new name, and nobody knows about this name.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:07.960]   Now, these are figures which suggest that there is this element of mystery in the New
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.920]   Testament sense, that it so transcends our ordinary experience, and even our thinking,
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.960]   and all our categories, that you have to use this kind of symbolism in order to give some
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.160]   kind of impression of it.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.600]   So that by definition, what we are talking about is something which to the men of the
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.240]   world is completely meaningless.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.800]   He can't begin to understand it.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.560]   He doesn't understand the gospel in its most open and explicit form.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.760]   He doesn't understand the way of salvation.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.240]   Even that is rubbish to him.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.880]   Well, if he doesn't understand that, how can he understand this?
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.920]   And that is why the world has always tended to regard people who know something about
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.000]   these experiences as being almost insane.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.080]   And of course it is a very good test to us, who are members of the Christian church.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:14.720]   Men in the church who have known this experience have generally been regarded as oddities by
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.520]   the bulk of church members.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.680]   They don't understand this.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.240]   The question is, are they Christian at all, therefore?
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.680]   This is a very good way whereby we contest ourselves.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.440]   It is the hidden manner.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.680]   No man knows about this unless he has tasted it.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   This new name is a secret.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.040]   It is something between the Lord and the believer.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.520]   The love of Jesus, what it is, says the hymn, none but his loved ones know.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.560]   He doesn't manifest himself to others.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.680]   He says that, not to the world.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.080]   I will manifest myself unto you.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.120]   He says of the Holy Spirit, the world knoweth him not and receiveth him not, but you do.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.320]   Now this is of course one of the most remarkable and glorious aspects of the Christian life.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   That is why Paul says about the Christian, he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.320]   he himself is judged of no men, which simply means this.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:21.360]   He that is spiritual, he has an insight into these things and a knowledge of them.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.600]   But the other man doesn't understand him at all.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.120]   He thinks there is something odd and peculiar and strange about him.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   He can see that the man is being ravished by something that is so real to him, and the
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   other one knows nothing at all about it.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.560]   That is the meaning of that statement in 1 Corinthians 2.15.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:50.440]   So now this is something therefore which by definition is difficult to describe because
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:57.040]   it belongs to a realm and to an order that is so essentially different from everything
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.720]   with which we are accustomed.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:06.400]   Very well, it follows from that also, doesn't it, that it is something not only very wonderful
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.480]   but something also which is very sacred.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:17.120]   And that is why you will find that the people who have known most about this kind of thing
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.960]   have generally been reluctant to say much about it.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.760]   They regard it as sacred.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.720]   I think I have told you before how, for instance, a man like D.L.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:36.200]   Moody, who was by nature what you would call an extrovert, he was that kind of man.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.720]   Some are extroverts, some are introverts.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.080]   Now he was very much the extrovert.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.240]   But even Moody very rarely spoke of that great experience which he had in New York City,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.800]   that experience that changed the whole of his life.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.880]   And the reason for it is this, that it is sacred.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:02.660]   It is wonderful, it is spiritual, and it is mysterious, and it has got this element of
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.200]   intimacy with the Lord.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   You see, there are certain things in natural, ordinary life, there are certain things you
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:16.600]   don't broadcast, your most wonderful experiences you don't share with many people, you don't
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.760]   make known to the public the most wonderful things in your life's story.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   And it is a very good way of testing people, this.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.280]   You see, this is where you are helped when you are concerned to avoid the psychological
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.760]   or the psychic even.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.320]   The people who have had some psychological or psychic experience are always talking about
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.520]   it, and are always very ready to do so.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.640]   You know, the people who are always getting visions and so on, they are always talking
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   about them.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.000]   That's how they betray themselves.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.560]   The very characteristic of this is that there is something sacred about it.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.840]   And therefore one is afraid, as it were, almost of betraying a confidence.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:12.640]   There is a secret between you and the lover of your soul, and you don't broadcast that.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.200]   In order to help others, you may mention it, you want them to know something about it,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.040]   and thank God that they have done so.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.500]   But we almost without exception, indeed without exception as far as I am aware in my reading
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:33.360]   concerning these matters, there was always this reluctance or hesitation to speak about
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   it.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Why?
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.920]   Well, lest again you might detract from it, and lest again you might be in the flesh and
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.880]   boasting of it, and you can't boast in this realm, the thing is too sacred, it's too
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.680]   pure, it's too wonderful.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:59.480]   So it follows that all who know something about this are careful and are hesitant, they
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.160]   don't parade it.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.840]   You see that was the whole trouble with the church in Corinth, wasn't it?
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.520]   It was parading the gifts.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.800]   And the man who truly understands these things doesn't parade them.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.720]   Bear that in mind, it's one of the best and most delicate tests, the sift between
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:26.440]   the true spiritual experience and the psychological or even the psychic.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.880]   Very well, there are some general remarks, but then another general remark is this.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:41.520]   There's a great variety and variation in these spiritual manifestations.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:48.360]   Sometimes it is something that comes instantaneously, you know, without a man seeking it, without
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:55.000]   his knowing much about it, he just finds himself having such an experience.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.560]   In the case of others, it may be very gradual.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.680]   You read of some who have sought this and sought it diligently and long, and have almost
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.760]   come to the point of despair of them.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.920]   But it's been gradual.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.960]   You can't stereotype these things.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:20.040]   Again, this is a very useful and a very valuable discriminating test.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.520]   Any experience that you can produce at will, I would say by definition is not a spiritual
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   experience.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.000]   I don't care what it is, speaking in tongues or anything else.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.240]   If a man tells me he can speak in tongues whenever he likes, I am doubtful as to the
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.420]   character and the nature of his speaking in tongues.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.040]   We don't control these.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.360]   There are no absolute rules.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.080]   There is no legalistic element, as it were.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:53.040]   No, there's a great variety, and for this very good reason, that it is entirely in his
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.420]   sovereignty.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.060]   You can't find him in this sense whenever you like.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.480]   You can seek him, but you can't guarantee that you'll find him.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:09.280]   This of course we ought to be able to see quite clearly from human analogies even.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.120]   You can't commend these most delicate human relationships and associations.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:22.040]   How much less can you commend the spiritual manifestations of the Son of God?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.240]   So there is, I say, great variation and variety.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.760]   But not only that.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.600]   You will find that it varies greatly from person to person.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.960]   It's very difficult to know why.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.680]   The only explanation that I would have is this, that in a sense you'd expect this again.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:49.720]   Because using once more the human analogy, we do not treat all people whom we know in
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.560]   exactly the same way.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:57.400]   I mean by that even people who, as far as we can tell, we like and we love to the same
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   extent.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.000]   Your treatment of them is not identical always.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Why?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.560]   Well because if you're a person with any sensitivity at all, you are so concerned to
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   help them and to be pleasing to them and everything else, that unconsciously even your conduct
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.200]   and your behavior varies.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.440]   They call out different things in you.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   And not only that, you feel that they need different things from you.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.720]   And so, though looked at in general, you may take the same view of persons, there is always
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.680]   a subtle difference.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:43.640]   You don't deal with two or three or four or five children in a family in exactly the
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   same way.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.000]   There are certain things that you do the same to all.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.560]   If you're a good parent, you don't have favorites.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.920]   You treat them all in a fundamental manner.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.480]   Yet you're aware that there are subtle differences in these children.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.080]   And you deal with them according to your knowledge of those differences.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   There are children, they're grown-up people the same.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.680]   There are some who are born demonstrative.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.360]   There are others who are almost offended by that.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.720]   Well, very well, you don't treat those two people in exactly the same way.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.080]   You love both, you're showing your love to both, but you don't do it in exactly the
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   same way.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.280]   Well, now I believe that this is true in this other realm and thank God for it.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:30.080]   We are not machines, we are persons, we are beings, and God our Father and the Lord Jesus
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.880]   Christ, they know us and they know us so intimately.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:40.440]   So one gets this kind of manifestation, the other gets that.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   Now I'm simply saying this because there is always the tendency for people to stereotype
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440]   these things.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.880]   You see, this is where the influence of the cults come in.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.520]   This is where the psychological and the psychic tend to come in.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.840]   Now they always do the same thing in the same way.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.600]   And I am anxious to show this difference.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.640]   That to me is what is so abhorrent about those things.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.400]   Forgive the expression, it's the kind of sausage machine mechanism.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.040]   And they're all almost identical.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.960]   Of course, it's mechanical, it's not spiritual.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.560]   Now in the spiritual, there is always this wonderful variation showing this marvellous
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.200]   fatherly love of God toward us.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.600]   But we can go even beyond that.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:39.320]   And we can assert that there are variations even in the same person.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.080]   And this is most important once more.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.920]   How often have the saints got into trouble?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.520]   How often have we, I trust, got into trouble ourselves?
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.920]   Because having had one experience, we seem to set that up as a norm and a standard.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:05.000]   And are so intent upon getting a repetition of that, that we don't recognize other manifestations.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.400]   And you see the danger.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.920]   Because we've got our eye fixed on this one experience, we seem to say that's the only
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.640]   kind of experience.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.680]   And we're seeking it and looking for it.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.040]   He gives us other things, but we're not looking at them.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.440]   We're looking there, instead of, and we don't realize what's happening here.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.800]   Now this again is so sad that we rub ourselves so often because we don't realize that he
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:36.080]   varies the experience even from person to person.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.240]   In other words, you will find this.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.160]   There are some people who seem to have an extraordinary experience at the beginning
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.760]   of their Christian life, which they never quite get again.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.360]   But they get many others, and they shouldn't be sad.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.760]   With others, it's the other way around.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.640]   They may spend many years in shallows and in miseries.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.960]   They may spend a long time under clouds.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.320]   Suddenly the cloud breaks, and the sun shines upon them.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.440]   Some even on their deathbed.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   There is a great variation with regard to these things, even in the same person, as
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.800]   well as from person to person.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:23.960]   All these things are of great importance in helping us to sift the truth from the spurious.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.580]   And then another general point which I must make is this.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:35.640]   That most generally, these experiences come to us through the scriptures, through the
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.480]   medium of the scriptures.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.040]   Most generally, I say.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.640]   But I must be careful to point out that it's not confined to that.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:53.680]   That though they normally and generally come to us in this immediate manner, they may come
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.960]   immediately.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.040]   They may come directly.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.900]   Thank God for this again.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:06.840]   And this is where we've got to be so careful that we don't exclude certain elements of
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.320]   our Lord's dealing with us.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.240]   You see, again, it's the spirit of fear that makes people do this.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:19.560]   They're so afraid of anything which happens to us apart from reading the scriptures, that
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:26.280]   they shut it all out, and thereby rob themselves in a most grievous manner.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:34.680]   Because the fact is that our Lord comes to us not only in the immediate, but the immediate.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.920]   Not only in the indirect, but in the direct.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.360]   It is for him to decide.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.960]   There is no limit upon him.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.080]   As he appeared to men in the Old Testament and in the New, he can still do so.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.920]   But now normally, I say, and you'd expect this, he comes to us as we are reading the
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   scriptures.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.640]   Or he may imply it by bringing into our mind a verse of scripture.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.840]   But we mustn't again lay down our rigid rules.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:12.960]   And then my last general point is this, that most frequently he comes to us through our
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.880]   internal senses.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.140]   But once more, we mustn't make this absolute.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:28.000]   He may, and he does appear, to the external senses.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.480]   Now what do I mean by that distinction?
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:36.960]   Well I mean this, external senses, the eyes, seeing with the literal, physical eye.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.080]   Same with hearing, with the external ear.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.000]   Feeling, touching.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:51.920]   You remember how John, you see, in his first epistle, puts it in terms of the external
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   senses.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:59.280]   That which was from the beginning, which we have heard and we have seen with our eyes,
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:06.240]   which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.080]   Now that's what I mean by the external senses.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:17.280]   But in addition to our external senses, we have internal senses.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.380]   You know how the apostle Paul, for instance, in writing to the Ephesians in the first chapter,
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.960]   he says to them, that he's been praying for them, that the eyes of their understanding
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   may be enlightened.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.440]   Now he doesn't mean the physical eyes, these are internal senses.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   The eyes of the understanding.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.720]   There is a spiritual eye, a spiritual way of perceiving.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.840]   There are spiritual ears, not the external ones.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.680]   You can hear without hearing an audible voice.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.840]   That means that you are hearing by the internal senses, and the same with all other senses.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:04.200]   So now, I say that generally speaking, these intimations and manifestations are given to
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.160]   the internal senses.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   What do I mean by this?
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.920]   Well, let me give you some illustrations.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:21.200]   The spiritual eye may be opened, and he may manifest himself to us in that way.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.760]   I mean this kind of thing.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.400]   The practical outworking of what Paul was praying there for those Ephesians.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.240]   Haven't you known this?
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.560]   That you are reading your scriptures, which you may have read many, many times before.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.880]   Scriptures concerning him, the Son of God.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.720]   But suddenly, it becomes illuminative, and you are conscious that you are meeting with
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.920]   him, that he is there.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.680]   You don't see him, but you see him in the scripture.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   He becomes alive to you.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.600]   You see the person of our Lord.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.680]   His person is made real to you.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.860]   You realize you are not merely reading about some historical person.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:11.960]   The person, as it were, materializes, I mean, in a spiritual sense.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:20.320]   And you not only realize the truth about him, but you realize the glory of his person, in
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.200]   a way that you had never done before.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:32.580]   And in addition to that, you realize the truth concerning him, as it is revealed in the scripture.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:37.900]   You realize, in a new and in a living and in a more vital way, the great truth concerning
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.320]   what he has done for us and for our salvation.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.240]   Now you, in a sense, you knew this before.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.880]   I mean by that you knew it with your brain, you knew it with your intellect, you knew
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.840]   it with your understanding, in the way that any man, as it were, who has got a brain and
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.440]   an understanding can perceive and see certain truths.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.240]   But there is all the difference in the world between seeing that, as it were, externally
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.680]   and suddenly seeing it in a living, internal, spiritual manner.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.220]   It becomes alive to you.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.220]   You knew it.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.360]   You were aware of the statements.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.720]   You were aware of the facts.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.440]   You could have given the correct answers.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.640]   But suddenly it all becomes alive to you.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.720]   Now, I'm using terms that we tend to use even in a natural and in a secular sense,
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   don't we?
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   You can say this about a piece of music.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:41.440]   You liked it and you've always enjoyed it, but suddenly it gets you, becomes alive to
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   you.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.120]   This can happen to a man who's playing a piece of music.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.420]   It can happen with a poem.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.260]   It can happen with anything that you may be studying.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.920]   You struggle along and you're getting your facts and you know them, but suddenly they're
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.160]   all fused together and you've got it, in a way that you hadn't got it before.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.560]   Now, I'm only using an illustration.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.400]   It is something comparable to that.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:16.560]   And so it is possible for us to see and to know something of the glory of his person
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.360]   and the glory of what he has done for us, and indeed of the glory that he is preparing
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.920]   for us, even while we are here in this world of time.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.960]   The men of faith have found glory begun below.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:40.280]   Celestial fruits on earthly ground from faith and hope can grow.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:48.600]   Now this is that your spiritual eyes are open and he manifests himself in that way to your
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.480]   spiritual eyes.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.960]   And then he does exactly the same thing in connection with the spiritual ear.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:04.760]   Now again, I'm careful to explain that I'm not talking about hearing an audible voice.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.820]   But this is the marvelous thing about this, and this is what you find in the testimonies
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.820]   of these people.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:15.860]   I read to you one last Sunday morning from Mrs. Hester Ann Rogers.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:21.080]   She said that she heard him saying, not with the external ear, but it was as definite as
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   that.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.920]   There is a hearing which is not physical.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   This is a realm of mystery.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.640]   Take for instance what we are told about the conversion of Saul of Tarsus on the road to
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640]   Damascus.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.920]   You remember he'd got a number of people with him.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.680]   And suddenly he was addressed by the voice from heaven.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.240]   We are told of these other people that they heard a sound but they couldn't discriminate.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.800]   Can you explain that sort of thing?
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   I can't.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.880]   I remember a man once trying to explain it.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.760]   He said that there's new electronics and so on, that it's a matter of wavelengths and
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   so on.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:05.120]   All right, if your natural material explanations help you to go a certain way along this line,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.440]   all well and good.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.560]   All I say is this, that if it's true in that realm, how infinitely more so is it true in
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.360]   the other realm.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.480]   Spiritual wave sounds.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.960]   So that you can hear without hearing an audible voice.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:26.120]   And this internal hearing is much more wonderful than the external hearing.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:34.040]   And what I'm referring to is this, that our Lord can tell you in an unmistakable manner
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.740]   certain things that will give you a clear and a full assurance.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:44.160]   He can say to you, "Thou art mine and I am thine."
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   He can say, as I quoted last Sunday from one of them, "Thy sins are forgiven."
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.080]   Now, you see, that's the sort of thing that happened to John Wesley that time in August's
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   Gethsemane.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.160]   He knew that his sins, even mine, were forgiven.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.720]   The Son of God may say to you, "I died for thee."
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.000]   Now he may do it through the Scripture.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.320]   He may say, "Now what you're reading is true of you."
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.240]   Or he may say it immediately.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:22.360]   Now this is what I mean when I refer to this hearing with the spiritual, with the internal
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   ear.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.760]   No voice is heard, but it's not only as definite, it is more definite than that.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.200]   It is an absolute certainty.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.320]   This is something that happens.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:41.080]   And that is why you find many of the saints, especially the hymn writers, they desire this
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.920]   and they're asking something that they know can happen.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.400]   "Tell me thou art mine, O Savior, grant me an assurance clear.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.720]   Tell me.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.920]   Speak, I pray thee, gentle Jesus.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.840]   Oh, how passing sweet thy words," and so on.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:06.640]   Now this is just a way of realizing that he can speak to the internal senses in that way.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.000]   And the same thing happens to the feelings and to the emotions.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.960]   This sort of thing.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:19.600]   You may have been under a spirit of heaviness or of dullness or of bondage.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.280]   And you may have been like that for months.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.640]   And you may have been doing everything you can in reading your scriptures, in praying,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.880]   tending public worship, everything you know.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:36.240]   But still, there is a sort of heaviness that you can't get rid of.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.040]   And suddenly you find it's gone.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.720]   As I say, the cloud breaks and the sun shines through.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.960]   He darts a beam upon your soul.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.520]   You can't explain it.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.640]   You can't understand it.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.920]   Suddenly you have a sense of peace and of joy.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:00.720]   Oh, you see, the hymn writer puts it again, "Sometimes the light surprises the Christian
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.320]   while he sings.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:08.040]   It is the Lord who rises with healing in his wings."
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.360]   It's surprising.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.520]   But he does it, and you can't explain it.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.320]   That suddenly your whole mood, as it were, has been changed.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   Revolutionized, transformed.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.480]   And the heaviness is gone.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.480]   And you're free.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.920]   You can't believe that you'd ever known a spirit of heaviness.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:38.240]   And in the same way, you can have a sense of his presence and of his glory.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.360]   You don't see him.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.480]   You don't see him with your physical, external eye.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.600]   But you know he's there.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.520]   No, I don't think I will.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.960]   But there's nothing more wonderful than that.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.000]   Just to feel the glory with you in the room.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.440]   The glory of God.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.240]   The glory of the Son.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.840]   You've done nothing.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.200]   He suddenly gives you this manifestation.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.560]   In his love, and in his mercy, and in his compassion.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:21.560]   And once a man has known something about that, he'll never be the same again.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.640]   And he'll never be really satisfied until he knows this more and more.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.680]   Now, take that last hymn we sang.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.600]   I can't understand why they left out another verse, which to me is one of the best of all.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:39.040]   "Oh, that I could forever sit like Mary at the Master's feet.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.720]   Be this my happy choice.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.360]   My only care, delight, and bliss.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.160]   My joy, my heaven on earth.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.840]   Be this to hear the Master's voice."
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:57.040]   That's the prayer and the longing of anyone who knows anything about these manifestations
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.560]   of the Son of God to the internal senses.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:06.480]   Well, just to complete this matter this morning, I must close on this.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:13.320]   Sometimes he manifests himself to the external senses.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.520]   This is, of course, something which is most mysterious.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.400]   But you've got it in the Old Testament.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.160]   You've got it in the New.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.480]   You've got what we call the Theophanies in the Old Testament, where suddenly the angel
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.800]   of the covenant appeared in a human form.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.320]   The authorities are agreed.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.240]   It seems to me beyond any doubt to be right that these were always appearances of the
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:42.600]   Lord Jesus Christ himself, who came in that particular form, the angel of the covenant.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   And they saw him, and he suddenly disappeared.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.280]   Now this, and the same in the New Testament.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.000]   The Lord appeared unto me, says the apostle.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.400]   Now, this is the point at which, of course, we have to be most careful.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.800]   And I'll give you just one example and illustration.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.840]   I've got here a book with the title Remarkable Passages in the Life of Colonel Gardiner.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:14.960]   This was written by the famous Philip Doddridge, the hymn writer, the preacher of two hundred
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:21.280]   years ago, the man who was minister at Northampton and kept an academy there to train young preachers.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:28.240]   I'm saying all this to tell you that Philip Doddridge was one of the most careful, judicious,
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.920]   by nature unemotional type of men that you can possibly conceive of.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   Not a hothead, not an excitable person, but a calm and cool and highly rational person.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:46.640]   He writes the account of his friend Colonel Gardiner, and Colonel Gardiner again was a
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:55.280]   man who was famous for and characterized by his judicious spirit, his ability, not only
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.560]   in his military career, but in every respect.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:08.040]   Not one of these sort of psychic people whom you expect to be reporting things like this,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.720]   quite the reverse by nature.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:14.400]   Now Colonel Gardiner tells this story, and again he was most reluctant to say it.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.200]   He only said it to the glory of God.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.960]   He was a man who had got on well in his profession, but he was living an utterly godless life.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.680]   His great experience came to him on a certain night.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:33.320]   He'd got an appointment with another man's wife at 12 o'clock midnight on this night,
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:39.400]   and he'd been spending his evening drinking and talking, not to excess, but amusing himself
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.840]   and entertaining himself, and now he'd gone back to his room to wait until 12 o'clock
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:50.120]   for his assignment, his assignation.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.640]   And there he was, he didn't know quite what to do.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:59.520]   But he accidentally picked up a book, a religious book, which his good mother or aunt had, without
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.200]   his knowledge, slipped into his portmanteau.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   The title of the book was The Christian Soldier or Heaven Taken by Storm, written by Mr. Thomas
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.920]   Watson.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.240]   And he just was looking at this in a most casual manner.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:23.440]   While this book was in his hand, an impression was made upon his mind, which drew after it
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.320]   a train of the most important and happy consequences.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   What happened?
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.000]   Well, this is what he described.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.640]   He repeated it more than once to Philip Duttridge, and he repeated it to another divine also
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.520]   at the same time.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:47.240]   He thought he saw an unusual blaze of light fall on the book while he was reading, which
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:53.520]   he at first imagined might happen by some accident in the candle.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:00.760]   But lifting up his eyes, he apprehended to his extreme amazement that there was before
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:08.880]   him, as it were, suspended in the air, a visible representation of the Lord Jesus Christ upon
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:17.680]   the cross, surrounded on all sides with a glory, and was impressed as if a voice or
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.640]   something equivalent to a voice had come to him to this effect.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:28.680]   And in brackets, for he was not confident as to the very words, but the voice said,
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:38.240]   "O sinner, did I suffer this for thee, and are these the returns?"
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.480]   But whether this were an audible voice or only a strong impression on his mind equally
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   striking, he did not seem very confident.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:50.840]   Though to the best of my remembrance, says Philip Duttridge, he had rather judged it
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.920]   to be the former.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   Struck with so amazing a phenomenon as this, there remained hardly any life in him, so
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.280]   that he sank down in the armchair in which he sat, and continued he knew not exactly
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.880]   how long, insensible.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:20.440]   But however that were, he quickly after opened his eyes and saw nothing more than usual.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:28.400]   But of course from that point on, he was a new man, complete change in his life, became
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.040]   a great saint.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:41.560]   Like Philip Duttridge, I quote it to you for one reason only, and that is to warn you,
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:48.600]   not to put your limits upon what the everlasting God may do.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:57.720]   I put that into the category of the most exceptional, but I have to report it.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:03.200]   We must not deny these things, we must not dismiss them as belonging to the realm of
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:11.040]   fancy, disordered brain, enthusiasm, or dangerous ecstasy.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.120]   We don't seek these things, we seek the spiritual manifestations, but we must not
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:24.840]   deny that in his own good time, and according to his own sovereign will, he may choose to
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:34.080]   do to some what he did to Cardinal Gardiner on that amazing occasion.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:41.680]   My dear friends, heaven is round and about us, the supernatural is ever with us, there
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.480]   are myriads of angels, do you believe in angels?
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:52.680]   The spiritual realm is round and about us if we but realized it.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:49:02.160]   And so I say these are some of the ways in which the Son of God may manifest himself
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.840]   to his children.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:12.120]   You realize therefore how carefully and reluctantly, all who know anything about this kind of thing
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:18.440]   have always been to speak about it, and yet my dear friends, we must do so because this
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:25.600]   is the salvation that is offered us, not a mere intellectual belief, which you were always
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   having to manipulate and to persuade yourself.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:39.200]   He died to bring us to God, to restore to the fallen race of Adam that knowledge of
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.160]   God which he lost in the original fall.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:51.280]   Well, God willing, we'll go on to consider next Sunday morning how this can be attained
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.880]   and how this should be sought.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.800]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
