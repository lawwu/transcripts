[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   Now I'm going to read this evening from verse 6 to verse 12 in the 14th chapter of Paul's
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.240]   epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.280]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.760]   to the Lord he doth not regard it.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.120]   He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.360]   to the Lord, he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.560]   For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.200]   For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.680]   Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.880]   For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that he might be Lord both of
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.320]   the dead and living.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.160]   But why dost thou judge thy brother?
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.800]   Why dost thou set up not thy brother?
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.720]   For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.160]   For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.120]   shall confess to God.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.880]   So then, every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.200]   Now we are dealing in particular tonight with the ninth verse, "For to this end Christ
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.840]   both died and rose and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living."
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   Now it's very important we should bear in mind the connection.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.760]   This paragraph again is a most interesting example of the great apostle's method.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.880]   We have often pointed out that in his epistles there is an obvious division into two main
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   sections, the doctrinal portion which always comes first, and then the application, where
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.800]   he deals with the outworking of Christian truth and where he deals with the practicalities
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.880]   of daily life and living.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.960]   But with this apostle we must never fall into the error of thinking that in the second section
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   he never has any doctrine or that he is finished with doctrine.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   That is never the case.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.040]   It doesn't matter what subject he deals with, you will find that sooner or later he always
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.400]   links it up with doctrine.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.080]   He was so concerned about this.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.560]   In other words, if we learn nothing else, this is a great lesson to learn, that the
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.720]   whole of the Christian life is something that derives from the truth that we have believed.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.600]   Christians are not interested in morality and conduct and behavior in and of itself.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.200]   Now the world is, the non-Christian is.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.720]   Anybody interested in ethics or in morality isolates it.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.360]   Now here that is never the case at all.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.960]   It's something that is deduced or derived from the great teaching.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.680]   And so it comes to pass that whether he starts with doctrine and goes on to the practical
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.000]   living or starts with the practical living, he always does the same thing in the end because
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.520]   each one leads to the other, and you go round and round in a circle.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.040]   Now there's a perfect example of that here.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.440]   The theme of course is, as we've been seeing, this very practical question of the rightness
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.560]   of eating certain meats and the rightness of observing certain particular days, feast
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.080]   or festival days and so on.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.560]   Now the apostle has been dealing with this in the way that we have seen, but in the sixth
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.640]   verse he lifts it up to this level.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.800]   He says what really matters is your motive, your object, your objective.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.760]   If a man does it unto the Lord, well then, says Paul, you've got to be very careful as
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.440]   you criticize him.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.600]   If a man can eat those meats unto the Lord, and if he gives proof of that by offering
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.960]   thanksgiving unto the Lord, be very careful how you judge him.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   And contrarywise, if a man doesn't eat these meats because he's concerned to glorify the
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.600]   Lord and to honor his name, again be very careful.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.720]   And if he can thank God for what he does eat, his herbs, or whatever it may be, well, be
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   still more careful.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.800]   Now that's the point that he's been making, but as I was pointing out last Friday, he
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.480]   can't say a thing like that, you see, without at once showing that here is involved a great
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   fundamental principle in the whole of the Christian life.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.720]   This you see is an illustration of the thing that I've just been saying.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.960]   Starting with the most practical matter, you suddenly find yourself led on to the consideration
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.280]   of one of the highest and the deepest doctrines of the whole of the Christian life.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.000]   And so he goes on, you see, in verse 7 to say, "None of us liveth to himself, and no
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240]   man dieth to himself."
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.160]   Whether we live unto the Lord, or whether we die, we die unto the Lord, and whether
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.640]   therefore we live or die, we are the Lord.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   Now there is this tremendous doctrine that we looked at last Friday evening.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.880]   In other words, it was, you remember, that whatever happens to us, we are always the
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.880]   Lord.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.320]   We are always in his hands.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.720]   And we are not to decide either about living or dying.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.240]   That is always his decision.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.080]   But now, having said that much, you see, he can't leave it even at that.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.040]   He's got to establish this.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.680]   And he does so in the ninth verse.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   He says, "For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that he might be Lord
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.200]   both of the dead and of the living."
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.400]   Now this is a way in which he's substantiating his statement that the Lord is Lord of the
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   totality of our being, whether it be in life or in death.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   And here he tells us how it is that this has come to pass.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.600]   And once more he gives us an exposition of one of these profound doctrines in connection
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.560]   with the whole of the Christian life.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.800]   Now he says, "To this end, for this purpose, if you like, this is why Christ both died
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.680]   and rose and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living."
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.120]   Now you'll find many translations that haven't got the word "rose".
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:30.520]   They read, "To this end Christ both died and lives" or "died and lived again".
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.120]   That's purely a question once more of this textual criticism.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.760]   Some of the best old manuscripts omit the "rose".
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.960]   It doesn't matter, the statement that he revived or lived again includes the "rising".
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.160]   What is clear is that he is referring to the resurrection.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.240]   So what the apostle is telling us here is this, that Christ is Lord of his people, whether
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.200]   they're alive or dead, and is always their Lord, and not only determines but guides them
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:13.040]   and takes them through everything as the result of his death and his resurrection.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.400]   Now this, I say, is a great New Testament truth.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.200]   There are many statements of it.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.240]   One of the best, of course, and the greatest, is the one that's found in the second chapter
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.440]   of Paul's epistle to the Philippians.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.960]   Let me begin to read at verse 5 in Philippians 2.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.240]   "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.960]   God, thought it not rubbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.920]   took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and being found
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.920]   in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   of the cross."
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   Wherefore?
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   Here it is.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   Wherefore?
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.560]   "God, because of that, in the light of that, as the result of that, on account of
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.040]   that, God also, hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name,
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.880]   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.960]   and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.520]   Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.360]   Now there is a very similar statement at the end of the first chapter of the epistle to
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.600]   the Ephesians, where he puts it like this.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.160]   You remember, he has three requests to make in his prayers for the members of the church
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   at Ephesus.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.880]   The first was, "The eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.480]   is the hope of his calling."
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.240]   Secondly, "What the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints."
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:51.880]   Then thirdly, "What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who do believe according
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:59.200]   to the power, working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.080]   him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.640]   principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.200]   this world, but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet."
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   Etc.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.600]   It is the same idea.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.560]   Our Lord himself had stated this after his resurrection in those words recorded in the
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.000]   twenty-eighth, the last chapter of Matthew's Gospel.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.520]   "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   That is his statement of it.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.040]   And then, there is a similar one in the book of Revelation in the first chapter, and in
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.680]   the eighteenth verse.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.640]   "I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.640]   Amen.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.840]   And have the keys of hell and of death."
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:00.400]   Now, you see, in each case, the important thing to notice is that this position which
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:11.880]   he now occupies, and it is a position of law-trick, is the result of his death and his resurrection.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.800]   And we have got to examine this because the Apostle feels that it is essential that we
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   should grasp this principle.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.360]   He is not content with merely saying, "He is the Lord of your life, whether it be in
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   life or in death."
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.160]   He says, "Realise that he is this because of what he has done for this end, with this
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.840]   object and purpose, Christ both died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   and of the living."
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:46.560]   Now, the lesson that we must learn, therefore, is this, that our Lord is in this position
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.920]   solely as the result of his death and resurrection.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.040]   And the implication is that he could not have been in this position were it not for that.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.120]   Now this is rather an astonishing thing.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:08.480]   As the eternal Son of God, he is not only co-equal with God, but equally omnipotent,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   and so on.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.440]   And yet it is quite clear that he would not be the Lord of death if he had not come into
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.320]   this world, and especially if he had not died and risen again.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:28.120]   Now, while our Lord was here in the days of his flesh, he was not the Lord of death.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.360]   He was subject to death.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.040]   You remember how Paul puts it in Galatians 4, "He was made of a woman, made under the
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.560]   law, that he might redeem them that are under the law."
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.720]   Now, being under the law means that he is under death, subject to death.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.080]   So that this, you see, is really a very important doctrine.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:58.880]   And while he was here in the days of his flesh, though he is the eternal Son of God, he was
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.560]   passing through a period of humiliation.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.900]   That's the thrust of that statement in Philippians 2.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:12.600]   He did it voluntarily, he did it deliberately, but it is an essential part of this salvation
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.840]   that he has come to give us.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:21.000]   But while he was in the days of his flesh and in the state of humiliation, he was not
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.400]   Lord of death.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.660]   He was subject to it, he was under it.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:33.080]   It is the very law itself that commends it and brings it to pass, and he being under
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   the law is temporarily not the Lord of death, but is under it and is subject to it.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:52.440]   But now, by dying, and this is why he died, and by rising again, the position has been
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   changed.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.920]   I wonder whether you have ever considered this great salvation from this standpoint.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.640]   People have often made that point and have asked the question, "Why couldn't God give
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:09.720]   us salvation as a gift by just saying so, by just doing so?
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.120]   God is omnipotent, God is all-powerful.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.880]   Why is all this necessary, namely the incarnation and the temptations and the suffering?
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.680]   Especially why is the death essential, the burial and the rising?"
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.600]   This has often been asked.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.240]   Why did our Lord have to die before we could be saved?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.120]   Now here is a part of the answer.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:39.240]   And a part of the answer is that he could not have delivered us from the thrall of death
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.200]   unless he had died himself for this cause, to this end.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.880]   Christ both died and lived again, rose and lived again, in order that he might be or
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:58.160]   become Lord both of the dead and of the living.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.680]   So you see, the teaching clearly is that the problem of death, and death as related to
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:11.920]   us, the fallen race of heaven, could not be dealt with by a mere fiat, by a mere statement
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.640]   of God.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.800]   Something has got to be done about it, and our Lord has done that by dying.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.200]   Now his teaching could not save us from death.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.840]   He only saves us from death by dying.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.040]   That is the teaching, and it is a tremendously important teaching.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.720]   How did he do this?
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.360]   Well the first thing he did was this.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.600]   He defeated death itself, and he defeated the grave.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.560]   Now that, as you know, is the great theme of the fifteenth chapter of the first epistle
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   to the Corinthians.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.800]   Paul works it out there.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.920]   The last enemy that shall be conquered is death.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.120]   It is the last enemy, but it is an enemy.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.160]   Death is there set against us all, and it is an enemy to the human race.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.720]   And the last enemy is death.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:10.320]   Well, the great claim of the Christian gospel is that our Lord has defeated death and the
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:17.280]   grave, he has conquered the last enemy, so that the Christian is able, you see, to turn
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.240]   to death and the grave and say, "Oh death, where is thy sting?
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.840]   Oh grave, where is thy victory?
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.000]   Thanks be unto God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.240]   Now what we have got to realize therefore is this, that until our Lord has died and
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   risen again, death had held all mankind in the grave.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.280]   There is no question about this.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.800]   This is the most important part of biblical teaching.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   Death had held all who had died in the grave until our Lord came and did this.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.440]   There is no single exception to that in a sense.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   You may say that the case of Elijah is an exception, and I grant you that in a way it
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.040]   is, and perhaps also the case of Moses also.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.000]   But apart from that, what happened there we cannot tell.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.360]   We do not know, we are not told.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.000]   But what is universal is that death has passed upon all men.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.120]   Now we have already considered that in the fifth chapter and in the twelfth verse, you
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:37.840]   will see that "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.120]   and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned."
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.920]   And as a result of that, the grave has held the whole of mankind in its throne and in
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.700]   its power and under its tyranny.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.480]   And there was not a single man who could defeat death and the grave.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.960]   This was universal defeat for the whole of mankind.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.560]   But now our Lord comes, and here you see is this wonderful thing that he has done.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.360]   And it is so interesting to me that Peter in his sermon on the day of Pentecost immediately
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.080]   fastens onto this point and makes a point of it.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.680]   The first thing that these people were given to realize was the significance of the resurrection.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.560]   They preached Jesus and the resurrection, and this was the source of their great joy
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.480]   and their great happiness.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.320]   They realized something of what was done.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.880]   Listen to Peter putting it.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.360]   Acts 2, let me read again from verse 22.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.280]   You men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.320]   God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know, him being delivered
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.400]   by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken him by wicked hands
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:02.680]   and crucified and slain, whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.140]   it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.920]   It was not possible that he should be holden of it.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.320]   It was very possible that everybody else should be holden of it.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.660]   And the "it" refers of course to the pains of death, to the bondage and the captivity
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.680]   that death produces and holds mankind in the grave.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:32.560]   But it was not possible, says Peter, that he should be held of this.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.420]   That is of course because, as he goes on to quote from the scripture, "David speaketh
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.640]   concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.600]   that I should not be moved.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.520]   Therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.920]   Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope."
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.640]   In the grave, David was given to see it prophetically, "My flesh shall rest in hope."
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   Why?
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.800]   Well, because "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.880]   one to see corruption.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.640]   Thou hast made known to me the ways of life.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.440]   Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance."
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.160]   Then he goes on to expand, "Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:22.480]   David, that he is both dead and buried and his sepulcher is with us unto this day."
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.240]   Don't imagine that David was writing there about himself.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.520]   David was there writing prophetically about the Son of God who was to come.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.840]   He's the holy one.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   God will not suffer.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.040]   He's the holy one to see corruption.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.280]   That's why it is impossible that he should be holden of death.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:45.480]   Somebody else had been, David included, as Peter makes a claim here in his sermon.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:52.440]   And what was true of David, it was true also of all the other patriarchs and all the other
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.360]   saints of the Old Testament.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.600]   Every one of them was held by death and could do nothing about it.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.200]   The last enemy had conquered them all.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.760]   Here is one who cannot be held.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.760]   Very well.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   This is a part of it.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.280]   And you've got the same point, of course, really elaborated in the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.280]   in chapter 7.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   Listen to this.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.680]   You see what all this meant to these men.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.240]   They're illuminated by the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.840]   And you see, this man writing to the Hebrews is writing to a number of Christians who were
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.040]   having a very hard and a very difficult time.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   They were being persecuted.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   They were being tried.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.480]   They were being robbed.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.160]   They were being misunderstood and molested in every conceivable way.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.880]   And they were tempted to discouragement and to despondency and almost to despair.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.240]   This is the kind of comfort that he gives them.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.080]   Listen to it.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   Now he is contrasting.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.040]   He's telling them that he's got a lot to tell them about Jesus Christ our Lord as a high
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.400]   priest after the order of Melchizedek.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.920]   But he says, I'm in trouble.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.080]   I can't do this very well because you've been so negligent in your study and in your going
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.320]   into these things, you haven't exercised your senses.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.120]   But he does tell them something about it all the same.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.240]   And it is yet far more evident, he says, in verse 15 of the seventh chapter.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.960]   "For that after the similitude of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest who is made not
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.840]   after the law of a carnal commandment."
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.040]   After what then?
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.000]   "Oh, after the power of an endless life."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.520]   Here it is.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.280]   You see, the only one who can save us finally is one who has an endless life.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.400]   The power of an endless life.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.800]   We've got a lost enemy to meet.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.920]   So a priest is of no value to us who is after the law of a carnal commandment.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.640]   "For he testifieth, thou art a priest forever."
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.560]   There's the point.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.560]   Forever.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   After the order of Melchizedek.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.640]   "For verily there is a disannulling of the commandment going before on account of its
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.800]   weakness and unprofitableness.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.320]   For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did."
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:01.600]   What he means by that is, the law made nothing perfect, but it did introduce a better hope.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.440]   There's prophecy in the law, prophecy of the coming of Christ.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.160]   "By the witch we draw nigh unto God.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.760]   And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made a priest."
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.680]   Then, here it is, those priests were made without an oath.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.440]   "But this with an oath by him that said unto him, the Lord swear and will not repent, thou
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.480]   art a priest forever."
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.160]   After the order of Melchizedek.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.520]   Why so much?
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.880]   Because Jesus made a surety of a better covenant, a better testament.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.880]   They truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   death.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.720]   But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:49.400]   "Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.960]   he ever liveth to make intercession for us."
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.320]   Now, it's exactly the same argument.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.720]   All this is put in a much simpler way in many of the statements that we have in the Scriptures.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.440]   You remember Paul preaching before Agrippa and Festus.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.040]   Makes exactly the same point.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.960]   Here it is in Acts 26 for us.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.760]   He tells us, "O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision on the
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.880]   rope of Damascus, but shall first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.840]   do works meet for repentance.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.400]   For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.840]   Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing to both small and
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.520]   great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:49.760]   come, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.560]   the dead."
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.360]   And yes, none had ever risen from the dead before.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.720]   That is a partial explanation of the cases of Moses and Elijah.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.280]   They did not rise from the dead.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.880]   They were taken without going through death, as far as we can understand what happened
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   to them.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:17.920]   But here is the first that should rise from the dead, and show light unto the people and
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.560]   to the Gentiles.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.560]   That is why he is also called the first begotten from the dead.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:30.880]   Or again he is called in 1 Corinthians 15, Christ the first fruits.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.480]   The first fruits of them that rise from the dead.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.560]   And the first fruit, of course, was the first picking of the fruit.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.840]   You never tested anything when you were a farmer in the ancient days, until you tested
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   the first fruit.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.920]   It was a sort of feast, may you remember, of the first fruits.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.360]   But we never tested anything of that harvest until they collected the first fruits.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.120]   The very first tasting.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   Christ is the first fruits.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.560]   Afterward, they that are Christ's at his coming.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.000]   So he is the first begotten from the dead, and he is the first fruits.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.920]   Now then, he was not held by death.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   He has conquered it.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   He has gone through it.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   And as a result of this, and this is the thing that the apostle is saying here, the thing
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:22.440]   in which we should glory is this, as a result of his doing that it is true to say, not only
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:28.560]   could not he be holden of death, we cannot be holden of death either.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.600]   Death cannot hold us.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.960]   We have already got a victory over death.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.200]   We are already able to use that language of 1 Corinthians 15, "O death, where is thy
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   sting?"
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.560]   We can say that before we pass through it.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.400]   "O grave, where is thy victory?"
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.880]   We know that.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   It is certain.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.280]   He having conquered it has conquered it for us.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:56.400]   So death can't hold us any longer, who belong to him, because of his death and his resurrection.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.160]   Well now, that's the first thing.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.200]   But you see, there is a second thing also.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.400]   And this is equally important.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:13.440]   He is Lord over the dead and the living because he has conquered death itself in that way.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.920]   But secondly, he is the Lord over the dead and the living because he has also conquered
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:30.480]   the devil, and conquered the devil ultimately by his death and his resurrection.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   Now then, the point of exposition of this of course is in that second chapter of the
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.560]   epistle to the Hebrews, which I read to you at the beginning, and particularly verses
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.600]   14 and 15.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.600]   That's why I read them.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   Listen.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:51.400]   "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:59.720]   of the same, that in order that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:08.200]   death, that is the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.800]   subject to bondage."
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.520]   Now you see, this is something additional.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.960]   He's not dealing there with the conquest of death itself, per se.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.600]   He is dealing with the conquest of the devil.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:26.920]   "For this cause Christ both died and rose and revived in order that he might be Lord."
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Right.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.560]   Partly I said through conquering death immediately, directly.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:39.760]   But also, this is equally important, his conquest over the devil who had the power of death.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.600]   Now what does this mean?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   You've often read that second chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, but what does
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   it mean?
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:54.000]   Take with it, if you like, the second chapter of the epistle to the Colossians.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.040]   Let me read verses 13 and following.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.800]   "And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.400]   together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.880]   ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   nailing it to his cross.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:20.560]   And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.440]   over them in it or by it."
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   Same idea, exactly.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:34.160]   He has had a victory over the principalities and powers of whom the head is the devil,
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.800]   in and by the cross, by death.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:45.760]   He might, as Hebrews puts it, "destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   devil."
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.840]   Now what does it mean by saying that the devil has the power of death?
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.860]   Well it doesn't mean that the devil determines when we die.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.680]   It cannot mean that, because the whole of the scripture teaches that it is God who decides
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.440]   that and God who determines that.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:10.880]   The devil doesn't control death and doesn't have the power over death in that sense.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.320]   Our times are in the hands of God, but there is an absolute proof of this in the book of
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:24.040]   Job, in the second chapter, where the devil, coming back to God the second time about Job,
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.920]   the Lord says to him, "Put forth thine hand now."
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:34.680]   The Lord said unto Satan, "Behold, he is in thine hand."
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.440]   God is giving permission to the devil to test Job, and he goes beyond what he had said in
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   the first chapter.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.680]   "Behold, he is in thine hand, but save his life."
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.000]   The devil can't touch life without the permission of God.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.240]   It seems quite clear to me in certain passages of scripture that God sometimes uses the devil
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.520]   to produce and to bring death to pass, but it is God who uses him to do that.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:08.040]   The devil has not got any inherent absolute power to decide when we live or die.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   He can't.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.960]   If he does it, he is given the command to do it, or he is used to do it.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.840]   So God can prohibit him to take the life of Job.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   So it doesn't mean that.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.520]   Well, what does it mean?
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.640]   Well, this word "power" means influence, it means authority.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.280]   In what sense then is the devil authority over death?
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:37.520]   And it does seem to me that the only adequate explanation that we can find is this, that
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:44.160]   it is the devil in a sense who has brought in death upon us and put us into this position
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.240]   in which we are under the throne and the tyranny and the dominion of death.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.760]   He did that, of course, by persuading mankind to sin.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.440]   There again you've got the teaching of Romans 5, chapter 5, verse 12.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.800]   So you can say that the devil in that sense only is the author of death.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.920]   Of course, he's not the ultimate author of it.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.400]   God had already said to Adam that the day in which he eateth of that fruit, he shall
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.840]   die.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.600]   It is God's punishment of sin, yes, but if man had not sinned as the instigation
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   of the devil, sin would never have come in.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:30.720]   Sin has, death has come in as the result of sin, and the devil persuaded man to sin.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.620]   So in that derived sense, he has this kind of authority.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.840]   That is why the scripture says that the devil was a murderer from the beginning.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:47.520]   Murderer in the sense that he has produced the death of all mankind because of its sin,
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.160]   but only in that sense.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:57.000]   The devil has introduced the sting into death, the thing about death that damages us and
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   hurts us.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.760]   Now, it's arguable as to what would have happened to men had he not sinned.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:09.160]   I take the view that there would never have been death but for sin.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.520]   Not that man was originally created immortal, but if he had lived as he should have lived
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.720]   in his time of probation, he would have been given the gift of immortality, but he didn't,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.160]   so death came in.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.960]   Very well then, and the devil, you see, because he persuaded men to sin, has introduced this
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.840]   terrible element into death.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.600]   Now I think you can look at this in another way.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.400]   All commentators have agreed that this is a very difficult phrase to expound, but the
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.440]   more I've thought of it, the more I've come to this conclusion that this seems to
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.240]   me to be the satisfactory explanation.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:57.040]   You remember that John says in his first epistle and in the fifth chapter towards the end that
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.840]   the whole world lieth in the evil one.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:10.000]   What he means by lieth is lieth in the gripper, under the power of, under the authority of
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.760]   the evil one.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.280]   He is the Lord of the whole of mankind.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.720]   He is called the God of this world.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:23.120]   He is called the Prince of the power of the earth, the spirit that now worketh in the
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.200]   children of disobedience.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:33.000]   So it is true to say that the devil has this authority or this power over the whole of
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.720]   mankind by nature.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:39.240]   We are all under the dominion of sin and of Satan.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:45.000]   He is, if you like, then the Lord of the lives of men and women.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.880]   And in exactly the same way, therefore, he is the Lord or has this authority and power
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.140]   over death.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:00.200]   In other words, everything that happens to the unregenerate is under the power of the
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   devil.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.680]   It is as a result of his influence and the fact that they belong to him that death is
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.900]   to them the last enemy, the thing that holds them.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:19.300]   It is in that indirect way that he has this power or authority over death.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:26.640]   Now what this man is telling us here in Hebrews 2, verse 14, is this, that Christ has destroyed
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.600]   him that had the power of death, that is to say, the devil.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.080]   Now don't be put off by the word destroy.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.920]   It doesn't mean that he has annihilated him.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.000]   It doesn't mean that the devil is no longer in existence, because we know that he is,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.140]   and that his ultimate fate yet awaits him.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.720]   And we know that he will never be annihilated.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.920]   He will be thrown to a lake of destruction where he will go on bearing his punishment
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.520]   forever and forever.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.920]   As we are told about the fallen angels in Jude and by Peter, that they are being reserved
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.360]   for that same final punishment.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:08.320]   So what it means is this, that our Lord by his death and resurrection has robbed the
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:15.400]   devil of that particular power that he has over death as it applies to all the unregenerate
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.880]   in the case of all those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:28.120]   In other words, the whole world lieth in the evil one, but that evil one toucheth us not.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.560]   He is not our Lord.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.080]   He has got no authority over us.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.440]   He has got no power over us.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.640]   He can't really touch us.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.520]   He can't harm us.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.760]   That is our position as the redeemed.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:44.800]   And therefore, this applies to all his activities in life and in death.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:51.000]   So that all that he was able to do to us by nature and in our unregenerate state has been
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.080]   made quite ineffective by the death and the resurrection of our Lord.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.640]   Our Lord has delivered us therefore from not only the thralldom of death itself, but from
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:09.440]   the tyranny of the devil who holds us, as it were, under death in that way.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:15.560]   He has been robbed of his power, and that is the exposition of Colossians 2.15.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.960]   He took these principalities and powers and put them to an open shame, triumphing over
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.440]   them in his cross, in his death and resurrection.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.480]   They thought they triumphed over him, that they had got him under the power of death.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.760]   They didn't realize, they didn't know their scriptures.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.200]   The scriptures quoted by Peter in the Sermon on the Day of Pentecost, and that is where
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.040]   they were finally defeated and indeed put to ridicule, put them to an open shame.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.520]   They thought they had got him.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.000]   But the last instrument by which the devil tyrannizes us, as it were, was taken out
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.640]   of his hands, this instrument of death.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   And so he has been robbed even of that derived power that he has exercised for so long over
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.120]   the whole of mankind.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.600]   He no longer exercises it over those who are redeemed and who believe in the Lord Jesus
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   Christ.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   Very well.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.720]   And what is the result of this?
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:15.800]   Well, this man tells us in the 15th verse of this second chapter of Hebrews, "And deliver
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.920]   them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.920]   What does this mean?
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:30.000]   Well, it just means this, of course, that anybody who realizes the truth of salvation,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.520]   anybody who realizes what the Lord Jesus Christ has actually done, will have been delivered
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.080]   not only from the power of death, but even from the fear of death.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.600]   Not only from the devil, but from all the fear that the devil can raise in us and has
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.680]   raised in the minds of all of us.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.840]   You see, this is where it is so important for us to understand this great salvation.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.240]   Some people seem to think the whole of salvation is just that your sins are forgiven.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.520]   And then when they come to die, the devil tempts them and they don't quite know where
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   they are.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.000]   And they are trembling, afraid of death.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.320]   You see, these early Christians were, that's why they were given this teaching, to deliver
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.040]   them from this.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.280]   But we've got to work it out.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.680]   How does he deliver us from the fear of death?
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.360]   Well, in this way.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.160]   Christ by dying for us has delivered us from the curse of the law.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:31.040]   You see, the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.800]   That's the thing that frightens the whole race with regard to death.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.000]   Now they sometimes don't realize this, but that is where death has such terrors for them.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   It terrors for everybody.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.640]   What's going to happen after it?
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.480]   There is a law written in our hearts that tells us that condemnation awaits us because
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.440]   of what we've done and because of what we haven't done.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:58.680]   And the fear of death exercises a tyranny and a bondage over mankind because of this.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   But you see, our Lord has dealt with this.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   He has delivered us from the curse of the law.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.760]   The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.560]   It's the law that is the condemnation.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.880]   Yes, but Christ has satisfied the law.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.840]   Very well, he's taken the sting out of death.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.440]   Death should have no terrors for the Christian.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.000]   The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.800]   My Savior's obedience and death hide all my transgressions from view.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.720]   This man in Hebrews at the end of chapter 9 says, "It is appointed unto all men once
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.280]   to die, and after death to judge."
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.960]   Yes, and it's the judgment that produces the fear of death.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.520]   But there's no need any longer.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.080]   We know that we are clear that we've passed through this.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.240]   We've passed from judgment into life.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.880]   So the judgment doesn't terrorize us, and as the judgment doesn't terrorize us, there
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.120]   is no terror in death.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.800]   "O death, where is thy sting?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.680]   O grave, where is thy victory?
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.840]   Thanks be unto God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.280]   Now that's one of the ways in which he's done this, but the other way in which he's
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.800]   done it is this.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.880]   He has brought life and immortality to light through his gospel.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.520]   You read your Old Testament.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.200]   Their whole ideas of life beyond the grave were vague and shadowy and indeterminate.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.920]   Oh, there was a glimmer there, but there wasn't very much.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   Go to paganism.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.520]   It's all still more nebulous and vague and eerie and odd.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:33.320]   Christ has brought life and immortality to light, a glory that awaits us.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.680]   So the Christian doesn't go out of this life uncertainly or doubtfully and wondering what's
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   going to happen.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.640]   He doesn't understand it all because it's so glorious, but he knows it is to be with
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.080]   Christ which is far better.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:51.440]   He knows that it is to be a life of glory and of unmixed joy and of happiness.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:41:01.120]   Now our Lord, you see, has got complete control over death and hell, over everything.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:08.000]   He is the victor, he is the conqueror, and so by his death and his resurrection he has
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.600]   purchased all this for us and he has given it to us.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:20.800]   So that it is in this sense that Paul says that Christ both died and revived and rose
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:27.320]   again and revived in order that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.400]   He is the Lord of the living, you are bought with a price, you are not your own, you are
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.680]   bought with a price.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.440]   We belong to him, he's purchased us, he's ransomed us, we have no right.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.320]   He's the Lord of the living, yes, but he's the Lord of the dead.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.760]   He owns us right away through and he has purchased this for us.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.080]   But you know there is still one other thing that is even more wonderful than all this.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.680]   I wonder whether you have ever thought of this.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:59.360]   Christ as the result of his death and resurrection has become the Lord of death as well as of
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.920]   life.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.160]   But did you know my friend that because you believe in him that you yourself also have
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.040]   become the Lord of death and of life?
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.880]   Where do I find that?
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:22.520]   Well I find that in 1 Corinthians 3 at the very end, verses 21, 22, and 23.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:27.640]   "Therefore let no man glory in men."
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   Why not?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:39.160]   "For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:48.000]   death or things present or things to come, all are yours and you are Christ's and Christ
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.280]   is God's."
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.040]   You notice what he's telling you?
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:57.080]   Death is yours, you own death.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.480]   Death is your servant.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.240]   Now this is the very acme of this astounding teaching.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.200]   Far from being in the throne room or under the tyranny or the dominion of death, far
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:15.520]   from death being something now that can hold you and therefore frighten you, you hold death.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:23.600]   Death is your possession, it is yours because you are Christ's and because Christ is God's.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.280]   In other words, if you and I only understood these things as we should, you would regard
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.880]   death as your servant.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.520]   I remember once putting that like this, you see, all things are yours.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.160]   But he said, "Don't glory in men, all men are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas."
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.840]   He says, "Look here, we apostles, we are not your masters, we are your servants."
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.480]   He says that again in the second epistle to the Corinthians, "We preach not ourselves
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.800]   but Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves, you are servants for Jesus' sake.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:59.040]   That's why I'm the servant of this church, I am the minister, I am working for this church."
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.400]   Now all this is true of all men and this is the wonderful thing about the Christian, all
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.120]   things are yours, all these men, all the great men of the world, they're all my servants.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.040]   I put it like this once, I said, "Shakespeare is my servant."
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.040]   And he is, you know.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.840]   Shakespeare is not my master, but he is my servant, I use him sometimes, I quote him
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.840]   now and again.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.320]   When I want him, I use him, and when I don't want him, I put him back.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.240]   And it's the same with all the world and all its great men and all its learning and its
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.000]   knowledge, all these men are servants.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.040]   The tragedy of the unbeliever is that he's a slave of these men and he listens with eyes
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.360]   and mouth wide open and he's governed by them.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.600]   He's glowing in men, poor fellow.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.880]   He doesn't realize they're all his servants, they're all given to him by the Lord.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.640]   No, this is true of death.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.080]   Death is our servant.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.400]   Death is someone whom you use in that way.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   And what is he?
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.360]   Well, let me tell you.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.560]   Let the Heidelberg Catechism answer that.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:05.520]   Death for the Christian is not a payment for sin, but an entrance into life.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:11.320]   Death is just the servant that now opens the door for us to go from this land of sin and
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.720]   woe to that land of pure delight where saints immortal reign.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.120]   Now think of death from now on just like that.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.580]   He's just a doorkeeper and he's a servant.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.880]   And he sees you coming and he opens the door and you're ushered into glory.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.440]   Now that should be your view of death.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   No terror, no fear.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.680]   Christ has taken away the fear of death that has held all mankind in bondage.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.440]   There are some who don't realize this.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.080]   The people say, "I'm not afraid of death, that's just because of ignorance."
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.480]   That's the tragedy with the drunken man.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.800]   He's afraid of nothing, he says.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.040]   It's because he's drunk.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.400]   And these men who say they're not afraid of death, it's because they're blind, they're
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.600]   ignorant, they're lunatic.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.840]   Any man who stops to consider what death really is and what it leads to, he's not only afraid
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.600]   of it, he's terrified of it.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.080]   But not the Christian, because death has become his servant.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.000]   Well, very well, let me wind up this by giving you one or two quotations of people who've
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   come to see this.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Here's one of them, a poet.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.040]   "With patient mind thy course of duty run, God nothing does or suffers to be done.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:25.640]   But thou wouldst do thyself if thou couldst see the end of all events as well as he.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.320]   He's Lord of life and of death.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.520]   Leave it to him, he sees the end as well as everything else."
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:36.240]   But I was reading of the death of a Christian, I can't even remember his name.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.600]   He was in terrible pain, but this is his experience.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:45.520]   "My pain," he says, "has been extreme, but I feel the presence of God continually.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.960]   And I sensibly know he is as near to me as I am to myself.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:56.760]   Whether I die at this time or recover, my will is wholly resigned.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:02.920]   But I know if he calls me now, I shall go to glory."
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:09.160]   To the doctor, he said, the doctor who was attending him, "It is of more consequence
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.800]   that you should repent than that I should recover.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.420]   For if I die, I shall go to God.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.520]   But if you do not repent, you will perish.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   You must be born again."
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.720]   He is a man dying in agony, saying that.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.800]   He turns to his doctor, who is here in Lothian, and says, "It is of more consequence that
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   you should repent than that I should recover."
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.320]   He's able to say that as he's dying.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.080]   "For if I die, I shall go to God.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.300]   But if you do not repent, you will perish.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.300]   You must be born again."
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:45.640]   And then he said, "I am going to the heavenly kingdom, the promised land for which I set
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.360]   out long ago.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.560]   Upon being asked by somebody, 'Do you now feel God graciously near?'
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.880]   He said, 'His spiritual presence is here.'
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.960]   And then, weeping with joy, 'I am full of God.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.120]   His glory fills my soul.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:13.400]   I have not the least doubt upon my mind, but that I shall reign with him in glory.'"
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:20.560]   That's a man who has not only lost the fear of death, but who realizes that death has
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.560]   become his servant.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.560]   He is possessing death.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.920]   Death has become his, and that's what he looks forward to.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.840]   The same is true, you know, of the dying D.L.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.160]   Moody, suddenly stricken.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:40.840]   In 1899, when he died, and he realized he was dying, he said, "This is my triumph.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.520]   This is my coronation day.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:49.200]   I have been looking forward to it for years."
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   For many years, he said, he had been homesick for heaven.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:02.720]   Very well, my friends, for this cause, Christ both died and revived, and rose again and
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:08.720]   revived that he might be Lord, both of the dead and the living and the is.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720]   He has conquered death.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:15.760]   He has conquered the devil, who had that strange power over death, and still has it over all
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.160]   who don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and who are not regenerate.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.600]   But for those who believe in him, death has lost its thing, its terror.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:36.000]   It becomes their servant, because it is but the servant, I say, that opens the door, that
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.280]   admits us to the vision of God, to be with Christ, which is far better, and to the glory
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   everlasting.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:53.800]   Have you been delivered from the thralldom, the agony, and the fear of death?
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.440]   You shouldn't be in bondage.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.000]   The fear of death shouldn't hold you in bondage.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.040]   Work it out.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.880]   Work out the meaning of our Lord's death and resurrection.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.400]   See what it has done, what it has accomplished.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.920]   Don't let the devil frighten you.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.960]   See, that's the trouble, as I've often pointed out.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:14.120]   Though he can't touch us, we allow him to frighten us.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.960]   And he can still frighten people of death, but you mustn't let him.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.080]   Turn on him and say, "You're defeated.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.760]   All your control over death is gone.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.840]   It's been taken away.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.520]   You've been destroyed.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.320]   All your power has been undone.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.280]   It's been taken from you.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   You can't do anything."
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.360]   Say, "I'm in the hands of this blessed Lord, who has conquered you and death, and
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.760]   who has brought life and immortality to light through his gospel."
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   O Lord, our God, we thank thee again and more than ever for the glory of this great salvation.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.440]   O, open our eyes to it.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:03.600]   We humbly pray thee that we may enjoy the liberty that is in Christ Jesus, liberty from
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:11.880]   these fears and torments and terrors and imaginations insinuated by the devil, our adversary.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:18.160]   O God, give us such a clear sight of these things that have been done for us by thy dear
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:24.840]   Son, our blessed Lord and Savior, that we shall be able to withstand the devil and to
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:31.240]   master him and to conquer him and realize that all things are ours, whether death or
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:39.000]   life or things present or things to come, that all things are ours because we are Christ's
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.320]   and because Christ is God's.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:48.520]   Lord, we pray thee to write these things deeply in our understandings and in our hearts, that
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:58.440]   we may be a rejoicing people and rejoicing in him who is Lord both of the dead and of
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.400]   the living, even thy dear Son.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:07.080]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:13.360]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:21.120]   of this our short, uncertain, earthly life and pilgrimage and until, having passed through
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.200]   death triumphantly, we shall be in the glory everlasting.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.400]   Amen.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.320]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
