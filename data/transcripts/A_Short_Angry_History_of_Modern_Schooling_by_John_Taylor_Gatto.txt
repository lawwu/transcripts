That's a quote from the Supreme Court decision.

[00:52:36.440 --> 00:53:05.280]  ikutika: A good idea. The American academic life: Any academic who expected free money from foundations, corporations, or government, would play the scientific management string on his lute. In 1961, the German consul of the United States, Hans von Braun, gave a speech at the National Assembly of the United States, saying, "The United States is a country that has a lot of riches and a lot of money. It's a great country to be in."
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:34.160]  ÐµÑ€Ñ‚Ð²al: The German concept of the political state as a fatherland surfaced in John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, in which his listeners were lectured, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." And in 1995, Time magazine, I believe it's February, the first issue in February, lectured its readers a cover story that, quote, "Democracy is the only thing that can be done for you."

There was only one important eugenical limitation on this school-created utopia to come. It wasn't intended for everyone, at the most for 20% of the existing population."
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:51.360]  ÐµÑ€Ñ‚Ð²: "The only way to create a utopian world is to create a utopian world, at the most for 20% of the existing population."
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:51.360]   And out of Johns Hopkins University in 1996 came this chilling piece of supporting data. I'm going to quote from the Hopkins report, "The American economy has grown massively since the mid-1960s, but workers' real spendable wages are no higher than they were 30 years ago. The purchasing power of a working couple in 1995, the government's purchasing power, and the government's purchasing power, are no longer the same."
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:56:19.800]  .dav: "The American economy has grown massively since the mid-1960s, but workers' real spendable wages are no longer the same as they were 30 years ago. The purchasing power of a working couple in 1995 was, after inflation was factored in, the same as earned by a single working man 90 years earlier. This steep decline in American common prosperity then forced both parents from home and forced their kids into the managed world of daycare and extended schooling. And although you and I'm not sure whether you or not think this is the answer to do this. I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure of this is this is this. I'm not that this is the answer to you and I'm not. I'm not the answer to you are you from the money in the money in the common prosperity and the money in the money. I'm going to the money and the money of the money that's and the money that's and the month of the PY and the POT.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:43.640]   And although you and I have been harangued endlessly, century long, that enlarging the scope of schooling would cause wealth to be more evenly spread, exactly the reverse has occurred. Wealth was 250% more concentrated by 1998 than it was in 1898.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:48.240]   I don't mean to be inflammatory, he said, but it's as if government school has lost its place in the middle of the PY and the POT.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:57:18.080]  , more than ever.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   The government school has made people dumber, not brighter, made families weaker, not stronger, has ruined formal religion with its hard-sell exclusion of God, has set the class structure in stone by dividing children into classes and setting them against one another and has been midwife to an alarming concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a fraction of our national community.
