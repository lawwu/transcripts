[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.300]   ♪
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.800]   A short, angry history of modern schooling.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.300]   And really what it is, is the 900-page book I've just finished, condensed to one hour.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:52.300]   So, I would have given you a five-minute break before starting, but somebody's a harsh taskmaster here.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:03.800]   The information's rather dense, and rather than rely on my own failing memory, I'll work from notes.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.300]   I'll apologize in advance, but this is very, very, very strong stuff.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:21.300]   Mass schooling of the young by force is a creation of the four great coal powers of the 19th century.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.300]   Germany, England, France, and the United States.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.300]   Its final conception, structure, and later development arises from the logic that fossil fuel,
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.300]   used in conjunction with machinery, imposes on society.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:50.300]   This reality is masked by an earlier anticipation of mass schooling in certain utopian and religious writings
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300]   about social order and human nature.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.300]   But make no mistake, in the Western world there was never any such animal as mass schooling
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.300]   until coal came along, paired with machinery.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.300]   You shouldn't be fooled any more than Charles Francis Adams was when he observed in 1880
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.300]   that what was being fashioned for children, unfortunate enough to be caught in the proposed school net,
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.300]   which hadn't happened up to then, combined the characteristics of the cotton mill, said Adams,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   and the railroad with those of a state prison.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   That's the Adams who had two presidents in his family.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   After the Civil War, certain utopian speculations about isolating children in compounds
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   and subjecting them to deliberate molding routines began to be discussed seriously
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   by the policymaking managers of business, government, and university life.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   These discussions were inspired by the potential for centralized mass production made possible
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   by coal-driven machinery, railroad development that was also dependent on coal,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300]   and startling new inventions like the telegraph.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   The principal motivation for this revolution in family and community life wasn't only greed for money,
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   although that was there, but also the philosophical conviction which approached a religion
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   in its intensity that early indoctrination would lead to an orderly, scientific society
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   led by the best people, unhampered by the democratic tradition or American libertarian attitudes.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.300]   Forced schooling was the prescription to make the bulk of the population alike,
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:07.300]   dependent on remote authority, not local authority, for allocation to one or another station in the economy.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   No more Ben Franklins, no more Tom Edisons were going to be allowed.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   Individuals would be prevented from taking up their lives until an advanced age.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.300]   During the post-Civil War period, childhood was extended about four years.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   In the late 19th century, a special concept was invented to lock older children in place.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   It was called adolescence, and that was a phenomenon unknown to the human race before that time.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.300]   And the infantilization of young people did not stop at the end of the 19th century,
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.300]   but it continued right on through the 20th.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   Child labor laws were extended to cover more and more occupations.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.300]   The permissible age of leaving school became higher and higher.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   The number of occupations not demanding schooling became fewer and fewer.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.300]   You notice I use the term schooling and not education.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   By the 1970s, it was not unusual to find graduate students well into their 30s.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.300]   From the start, there was a purpose behind schooling,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   which had nothing to do with what parents, kids, or communities wanted,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:40.300]   but concentrated on what a highly centralized economy and a strong political state was thought to need.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:50.300]   What that was can be seen from this excerpt from a speech Woodrow Wilson made to businessmen in 1914.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   I'm quoting Wilson without changing a word.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.300]   "We want one class of persons to have a liberal education,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.300]   and we want another class, a very, very much larger class of necessity,
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific, difficult manual tasks."
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.300]   By 1917, the major administrative jobs across America in schooling
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   were under the control of a group of interests referred to in the press as the Education Trust.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   That term vanishes somewhere in the middle 1930s,
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.300]   but it's quite common in the newspapers of the teens and the 20s.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.300]   At the first meeting of the Education Trust,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:52.300]   the attendees included representatives of Rockefeller, Carnegie, Harvard, Stanford,
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.300]   the University of Chicago, and the National Education Association.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.300]   "The chief end of the new education," wrote Benjamin Kidd in 1918,
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:11.300]   "was to," I'm quoting, "impose on the young the ideal of subordination."
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.300]   The primary target of the first 30 years of forced schooling
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.300]   was the tradition of independent livelihoods in America.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.300]   Students were to learn to think of themselves as employees competing with one another
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.300]   for the favor of the boss,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   not as entrepreneurs like Ben Franklin competing to serve the public.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   It was believed that only in this way could the menace of overproduction in America be contained.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.300]   You'd have to, ladies and gentlemen, read into the primary sources,
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.300]   as I've spent years reading,
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:56.300]   to see how often the term "overproduction" emerges in these discussions of businessmen
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.300]   between 1880 and 1910.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.300]   They were terrified that the early tradition of America,
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.300]   that people worked for themselves, would continue,
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   and that this would make it impossible for large central corporations to get financing to work,
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.300]   since their machinery costs so much money.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   Who would constantly replace that machinery
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:30.300]   if at any moment the peril of thousands of people opening small competing interests were a loss?
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   So it had to be put to death.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.300]   In 1919, Arthur Calhoun's "Social History of the Family"
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   informed the nation that the child was passing from the family,
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   I'm quoting now, "into the custody of community experts."
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   And he offered a significant prophecy,
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   that we could expect in time to see a system of public education,
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   "designed to check the mating of the unfit."
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.300]   In 1922, Mayor Hyland of New York City,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   alluding specifically to actions in schools of the Rockefeller Foundation
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   and other corporate interests,
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:24.300]   said in a public speech that the schools had been seized as an octopus would seize its prey
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   by, quote, "an invisible government."
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   You'll find that reference in Diane Ravitch's book, "The Great School Wars."
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   Be good now, later.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.300]   The 1920s were a boom period for forced schooling,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.300]   as well as for the stock market.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   A book called "A Sociological Philosophy of Education," published in 1928,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:57.300]   claimed it is the business of teachers to run not merely the school, but the world.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   In 1929, the famous creator of educational psychology,
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   Edward Thorndike of Columbia Teachers College,
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:12.300]   announced, I'm quoting, "academic subjects are of little value."
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.300]   His colleague at Teachers College, William Kirkpatrick,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   boasted in his book, "Education and the Social Crisis,"
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   that the whole traditional system of rearing the young was being made over by experts.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   Meanwhile, in the project offices of an important employer of those experts,
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   the Rockefeller Foundation,
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:46.300]   executives were hearing from its president, Max Mason, on April 11, 1933.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   Don't say that I'm not giving you very specific references.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   It can't be checked.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   That a comprehensive program was underway to rationalize social control
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.300]   and the control of human behavior,
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.300]   inspired by the genetic work of an Eastern European scientist,
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   Herman Muller, at the University of Texas.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.300]   Rockefeller, Carnegie, and other large private foundations
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.300]   had been investing heavily in genetics.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.300]   Muller had used x-rays to override genetic law,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.300]   inducing mutations in fruit flies.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.300]   And that set off a line of thinking that it might be possible
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:38.300]   to create life and shape it as you wanted to.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   Muller preached that planned breeding was necessary to bring mankind progress,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.300]   and his proposal received enthusiastic endorsement
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.300]   from most of the greatest scientists of the day.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   He reduced it to a 1,500-word geneticist manifesto,
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:06.300]   and 22 distinguished American and British biologists signed it.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:14.300]   "The conscious guidance by the state of human sexual selection is called for," said Muller.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   What was wanted, he said, was a project of racial hygiene,
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.300]   such as the policy makers in Germany were pioneering--
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.300]   a program where eugenics was state policy
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   and where scientific research shaped society.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.300]   A February 1934 progress report from the Rockefeller endowments
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   asked the question, "Can we develop so sound and extensive a genetics
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.300]   that we can hope to breed in the future superior men?"
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.300]   Just a few months before this report appeared,
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.300]   the executive director of the National Education Association
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.300]   announced that his organization expected--I'm quoting directly now--
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:13.300]   "to accomplish by education what dictators in Europe are seeking to do by compulsion and force."
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.300]   You can't get it much clearer than that, can you?
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:26.300]   Between 1967 and 1974, teacher training all over the United States
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.300]   was covertly revamped through the coordinated efforts
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   of a small number of private foundations, think tanks, global corporations, universities,
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   and several other interests working through the United States Office of Education
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:50.300]   and through key state ed departments like those in California or New York.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   The most important documents in this transformation were three,
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.300]   and I'm going to name them for you.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives was the first.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.300]   An extensive government exercise in futurology called
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   Designing Education for the Future was the second,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   and the Behavioral Teacher Education Project was the third.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   That was an enormous manual of over 1,000 pages,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   which in time impacted on every school in the United States.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   While other documents exist, these are the most important representatives of the whole.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   They'll serve to make clear to you what project is underway,
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.300]   and I'll take them one by one.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   Designing Education, produced by the Federal Education Department,
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   redefined education after the Prussian fashion as, quote,
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:57.300]   "a means to achieve important economic and social goals of a national character."
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   State education agencies would henceforth act as on-site federal enforcers,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   ensuring compliance of local schools with Washington directives.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   It proclaimed that each state education department, quote,
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.300]   "must be an agent of change."
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.300]   State departments were, quote, "to lose their identity as well as their authority
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   in order to form a partnership with the federal government."
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   Now, I think you and I both are aware that what we're talking about here is a form of treason.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   There is no mention whatsoever in any of the founding documents of this country
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   of federal involvement in education.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   It's not just an academic thing.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.300]   It was deliberately kept away from the central political power
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   because of the obvious chance to pervert it
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   if it were handed to the power that controlled the army.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   The second document, the gigantic Behavioral Teacher Education Project,
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:12.300]   outlined the teaching reforms to be forced on America after 1967.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.300]   So we're talking about 31 years ago.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:22.300]   If you ever want to hunt this thing down, it bears the US Office of Education contract number,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.300]   and I can give it to anyone afterwards.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   I have it here, but I won't bother to read the 44 digits.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   The document sets out clearly the intention of its creators,
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.300]   nothing less, I'm quoting from the document now,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   than the impersonal manipulation through schooling of a future America
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   in which few will be able to maintain control over their opinions.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:54.300]   An America in which each individual receives at birth a multipurpose identification number
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.300]   which enables employers and other controllers, that's a direct quote from the document,
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   to keep track of underlings and to expose them to direct or subliminal influence when necessary.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   Readers learned that chemical experimentation on minors
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.300]   would be normal procedure in the post-1967 world.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   That is surely a pointed foreshadowing of the massive riddle and interventions
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   which accompany the practice of forced schooling at present.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   The Teacher Education Project identified the future as one, I'm quoting again,
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   in which a small elite will control all important matters,
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   one in which participatory democracy will largely disappear.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   It was your tax money or your father's and mother's that paid for this document.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   Children will be made to see through school experience that their classmates,
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.300]   this is a very subtle point, so I'll start that again,
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.300]   children will be made to see through school experience that their classmates
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   are so irresponsible and inadequate that they must be controlled and regulated for society's good.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:20.300]   That's of a category I think equivalent to the wag your dog scenario
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   that I think we're going through right now.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:35.300]   According to the project, post-modern schooling will focus,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   this is a direct quote, on pleasure cultivation and other attitudes and skills
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   compatible with a non-work world.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   Notice how the tremendous rise in school violence and general school chaos
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   in the late 1960s can be seen as providing a reasonable justification
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   for the sharp constriction of traditional intellectual schooling.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   Each outburst of childish disorder echoing through the press
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   was like an advertisement promoting the need to surrender community control
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   to the management of experts and for the introduction of emergency measures
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   like special education and Ritalin.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   Anyone who taught school during that period in a large city as I did
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   will remember how teachers and administrators were suddenly stripped
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:40.300]   of any effective ability to discipline children by the intervention of outside agencies.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:46.300]   You are at liberty to decide whether that was coincidental or not.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.300]   It makes sense though, doesn't it, that irresponsible, semi-literate children
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   kept in that condition by authority will become irresponsible and semi-literate adults
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   and that such people can't be trusted with decisions.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.300]   The National Teacher Training Document informed teacher educators
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   that under these circumstances teachers were to be trained as therapists,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   translating prescriptions of social psychologists into practical action in the classroom.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   The third of the new gospel texts was Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   In his own words, I'm quoting, "a tool to classify the way individuals are to act,
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   think, or feel as the result of some unit of instruction."
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   Using the methods of behavioral psychology, children would learn improper thoughts,
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   feelings, and actions and have their improper attitudes brought from home remediated.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   In all stages of school manipulation, testing would be essential
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   to locate the child's changing mind on an official rating scale.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   Bloom's taxonomy spawned a number of important descendants which you've heard of.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   Mastery learning was one, outcomes-based education a second,
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.300]   and the current school-to-work government-business collaboration a third.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   Each was designed to classify individuals for the convenience of social managers
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.300]   and to control the mind and movements of the young.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:40.300]   But what was the purpose? Why was this being done?
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.300]   A major piece of the answer can be found by reading between the lines of an article
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   which appeared several months ago in the June 1988 issue of Foreign Affairs.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   Written by the owner of U.S. News and World Report,
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   the essay praises the American economy and predicts that its lead over Europe and Asia
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   is so psychological in nature that no nation can possibly catch up to us
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   because our workers are unique.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   Unless you believe in master race biology,
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   this advantage can only have come from school training of the American young,
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   in school and out, by indoctrination techniques which produce attitudes useful to management.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   And what are those attitudes?
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.300]   Folks, would it be possible if we took a five-minute break?
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   These lights are a little bit bright, and I just need a short rest owing to advanced age.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:53.300]   But in five minutes, I promise you that I'll answer the question I just asked.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   Just rest for five. I bet you need it more than I do.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.300]   ...offers from a strong craft tradition.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.300]   The workers demand a large voice in decision-making.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   "Asia's even worse off," says Zuckerman competitively,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   "because although the worker is silenced in Asia,
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   religion, tradition, and government over there interfere with what a business can do."
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:27.300]   So that's his first case, that the American worker--that's your sons and daughters grown up--is a pushover.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   Next, says Zuckerman, "Workers in America live in constant panic.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.300]   They know companies here owe them nothing.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.300]   There's no outside power to appeal to.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   Fear is our secret supercharger.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:51.300]   It gives management here a flexibility that other nations will never have to such an extent."
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   And some of the evidence he offers for that is really compelling.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   He said, "In 1996, after five years of record economic expansion,
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   half the employees of large firms feared being laid off."
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   "The best part of that," said Zuckerman, "was that it represents double the number of people
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.300]   worrying five years ago when things weren't nearly as good.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:24.300]   So fear keeps a break on American wages."
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:30.300]   Next, he says, "In the United States, what look like managerial decisions
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.300]   are actually made by abstract mathematical rules,
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   which are manager-proof as well as worker-proof.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   No sentimentality, no ideological treachery by a soft-hearted boss
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   can make more than temporary inroads on corporate momentum here
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   because the accountant's bottom line rules everything."
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   And finally, he says, "Our endless consumption completes the golden circle.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   Consumption driven by a nonstop American addiction to novelty,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   which provides American business with the only reliable domestic market in the world.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   Elsewhere in hard times, business dries up because people sit on their money.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   But here, no. Here we shop till we drop.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   We mortgage our futures in bad times as well as good."
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   And I think Zuckerman is right.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:38.300]   There isn't much doubt that the fantastic wealth of American big business
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   is psychologically and procedurally grounded
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   and that the training for this mental state
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   and the necessary docility it requires comes from the American classroom.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   Schools must train individuals to respond as a mass,
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   to be frightened, envious, bored, emotionally needy, and generally incomplete.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:11.300]   It's common sense a successful mass production economy has to have such a clientele.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   A small business, small farm economy like the Amish have
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   require individual competence, thoughtfulness, compassion, and universal participation.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   But ours requires a well-managed mass, leveled, spiritless, anxious, familyless, friendless,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   godless, and obedient, people who believe the difference between Coke and Pepsi
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   is a subject worth arguing about.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:51.300]   We need people for this economy who learn that status is purchased
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.300]   so that when you buy something you're immediately dissatisfied with it
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   because it's not producing the rush that you expected from the advertising.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   We need people who learn that others manage our lives,
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:12.300]   that most people, including our own parents, are ignorant and irrelevant,
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.300]   that God is an obsolete fancy not worth bothering about,
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   and that ultimate satisfaction comes from official approval.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   The fantastic wealth of American big business is a direct result of school training.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:37.300]   Schools training children to be fearful, bored and addicted to novelty,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   suspicious of themselves and others, and voiceless in important matters.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   That's what the bells are for, they say, and now for something different.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   The secret of American schooling is that it doesn't teach the way children learn,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:02.300]   as I think Inge represented well to you, nor are schools supposed to.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   School has been engineered to serve a particular kind of economy
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:14.300]   and a strictly layered social order, not to benefit kids and families.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.300]   That's why it has to be compulsory.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:23.300]   The prime directive of schooling is to retard maturity and wholeness.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:29.300]   School is the first impression children get of organized society,
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   and like most first impressions, it is the lasting one.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   The decisive dynamics which make forced schooling poison to healthy human development
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   are easy to spot, and I'll give you a small package of these.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   The work with which most classrooms engage the child is not significant work.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   It doesn't satisfy real needs, pressing on the individual,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   and doesn't answer real questions that experience raises in the young mind.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   It doesn't contribute to solving any problem encountered in actual life.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   The psychological effect of making work external and foreign to individual longings,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:24.300]   experience, questions, and problems renders the victim listless.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   Growth and mastery only come to those who vigorously self-direct.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.300]   We've known that for thousands of years.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   If you doubt it, examine the differences between elite education in any century you choose
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   and the direction of common training.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   I'll be talking a little specifically about this tomorrow morning.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   Initiating, creating, reflecting, and other things like that, active things,
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:30:03.300]   are precisely what the structure of schooling is set up to prevent on one pretext or another.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:10.300]   As I watched it happen for 30 years, it takes about three years to break most kids.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:17.300]   Three years confined to environments of emotional neediness with nothing real to do.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   And I must say, Inga, if you're here, you added another dimension to this for me
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   by showing that formula that only one third of the time inside of school,
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:37.300]   it's like the army, you're actually doing anything at all.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   In such environments, songs, smiles, bright colors, and cooperative games
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.300]   do the work better than angry words and punishments.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:54.300]   Has it ever struck you as odd that the Prussian government--
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   now, of course, we don't have a nation called Prussia anymore
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:05.300]   because the nation called Prussia overwhelmed the other 171 German states
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   and Germany became Prussia or greater Germany was Prussia
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:17.300]   and we got the two great wars of the century from Prussia.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   Has it ever struck you as odd that the Prussian government
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:26.300]   was so sympathetic and helpful to the experiments of Friedrich Freubel,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.300]   the inventor of kindergarten, and to Heinrich Pestolazzi,
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   who was the inventor of Fun and Games Elementary School?
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   Both those guys were underwritten by the Prussian government.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   All their assistants were Prussian government agents.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   It's a little strange to think of the guys with the points on their helmet
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:55.300]   and all the funny balloons, but there was a method to that madness.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.300]   The strongest meshes of the school net are totally invisible.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:06.300]   Constant bidding for a stranger's attention creates a chemistry
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:11.300]   whose products are the common characteristics of modern school children--
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   whining, dishonesty, malice, treachery, cruelty.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   The unceasing competition for official attention--
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   have you ever seen the little arms go out of the sockets,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   jumping out of the seat--in the dramatic fishbowl of a classroom
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   delivers cowardly children, little people sunk in chronic boredom,
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:42.300]   little people with no apparent purpose for being alive.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   The procedure is identical to that which causes caged rats
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   to develop eccentric mannerisms when they have to press a bar for food
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   on an aperiodic reinforcement schedule,
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.300]   where food is delivered but at random, but the rat doesn't know that.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   Much of the bizarre behavior school kids display
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   is a function of the reinforcement schedule
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   and the endless confinement and inactivity
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.300]   which slowly drives children insane.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   Trapped children, like trapped rats, need close management,
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   as any rat psychologist will tell you.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   See, I'm more eloquent when I'm seated.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:40.300]   And you will be too when you get to be my age and weight.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   In the first decades of the 20th century,
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   a small group of famous academics,
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   symbolically led by John Dewey and Edward Thorndike,
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   of Columbia Teachers College, Elwood Coverley of Stanford,
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   and a handful of others,
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   together with their corporate and financial allies,
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   like J.P. Morgan, Vincent Astor, Commodore Whitney, Andrew Carnegie,
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   and John D. Rockefeller,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:15.300]   decided to bend government schooling to the service of business
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   and the political state,
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   as it had been done nearly a century before in Prussia.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   A higher mission for this project existed too,
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.300]   one to catch the imagination of dreamers and to fire the blood.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:38.300]   School was to serve as an instrument for managing evolution,
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   establishing the preconditions for selective breeding.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   In Thorndike's memorable words,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   and you remember Thorndike is the creator
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   of what we call educational psychology,
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   in Thorndike's memorable words,
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   this had to be done quickly before the new industrial masses,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   quote, "take things into their own hands."
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.300]   Standardized testing would eventually be used
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   to separate those fit to breed and fit to work from those unfit.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   Because of its traditions, however,
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   America was a resistant population on which to experiment.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   But thanks to the patronage and the interest
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   of various international business people,
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   a group of academic social engineers
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   was able to visit mainland China
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   in the first three decades of the 20th century.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.300]   Someone really ought to make a movie about what I'm going to tell you next.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:46.300]   And live there as John Dewey lived in post-revolutionary China
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   for two years.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   In China, these men could test pedagogical theory
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   on a docile and bewildered population
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   which had recently lost its ancient form of governance.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   Important school superintendents were in on this work,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   although the general public is in the dark about it to this day.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.300]   For example, I'd like you to listen to Dr. H.B. Wilson,
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   superintendent of the Topeka schools,
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.300]   writing in his book, which absolutely nobody read
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   or would want to read.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   It's called Motivation of Schoolwork.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.300]   He wrote it in 1916, but this one paragraph
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.300]   was worth the agony of reading his whole book.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.300]   The introduction of the American school into the Orient
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:46.300]   has broken up 40 centuries of tradition.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.300]   It has given us a new China, a new Japan,
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:54.300]   and is working marked progress in Turkey and the Philippines.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   The schools are in a position to determine the lines of progress.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   The Chinese Revolution was Western-inspired
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.300]   and Western-financed, just as the Russian Revolution
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.300]   soon was to be.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   And it placed that nation in a favorable state
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.300]   of disintegration for laboratory testing
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.300]   of pedagogical mind-alteration technology.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:25.300]   Out of this ferment rose a Chinese tracking practice
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.300]   built on the ancient habit of character references,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   modernized and bureaucratized.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   It's called in China the Dangan.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   It is a continuous, lifelong personnel file
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.300]   exposing a student's intimate history from birth
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.300]   through schooling and then through life.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.300]   The Dangan constitutes a comprehensive overthrow
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   of privacy, and today nobody works in China
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.300]   without a Dangan.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:05.300]   By the mid-1960s, preliminary work on an American Dangan
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   was taking place in schools as information reservoirs
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   attached to schooling began to store personal data
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   about individual children.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   A new class of expert, like Ralph Tyler
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   of the Carnegie Foundation, began to urge
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   the collection of data and its unification
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.300]   in computer code to enhance cross-referencing
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   with all the other data banks.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.300]   By 1971, psychologists in the pay of government
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.300]   and private foundations were justifying
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   surreptitious data gathering from children
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   as the moral right of institutions.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   I want to take you back a few years again.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   Between 1896 and 1920, a small number
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.300]   of powerful industrialists, together with their
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   private foundations, sponsored university administrators,
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   house experts, and house politicians
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   spent more money on mass forced schooling
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   than the government did.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.300]   Indeed, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.300]   together spent more money than the government
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.300]   did on schooling between 1900 and 1920.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   In this laissez-faire fashion, a system
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.300]   of modern schooling was constructed
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   without public participation.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   I don't blame you if you're a little surprised
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   by this data, but as my publisher was quite surprised
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   by it, and when I demonstrated its validity
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.300]   from the documents of the Carnegie Foundation
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   and the Rockefeller Foundation-- there are others as well,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   but those are major players-- they wouldn't
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.300]   allow it to be printed.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   I thought it was written.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.300]   It's in public domain.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.300]   They said they didn't want the hassle.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.300]   If you want to know the motives of this project,
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.300]   you need only read the first public mission statement
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   of Rockefeller's General Education Board
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   that was printed in its first report to well-wishers,
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   issued in 1906.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.300]   And I'm going to read you the first paragraph,
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.300]   and I guarantee you it's utterly unbelievable.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   And if you have children, this ought
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   to be as chilling as anything you've heard recently.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.300]   "In our dreams, people yield themselves
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   with perfect docility to our molding hands.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   The present education conventions
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   of intellectual and character education
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.300]   fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   we work our own will upon a grateful and responsive folk."
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   Can you believe people actually wrote this and printed it?
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   "We shall not try to make these people
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.300]   or men of science.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   We have not to raise up from them authors, educators, poets,
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   men of letters.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:23.300]   We shall not search for artists, painters, musicians, lawyers,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen,
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.300]   of which we have an ample supply.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   The task is simple.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   We will organize children and teach them
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   doing in an imperfect way."
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.300]   The real purpose of modern schooling
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.300]   was announced by Edward Ross of the University of Wisconsin
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.300]   in the same year that was written.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   Ross is generally considered one of the three founders
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   of the 20th century discipline called sociology.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.300]   And in a book bluntly called Social Control, Ross wrote,
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.300]   I'll quote directly, "Plans are underway
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   to replace family, church, and community with propaganda,
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   education-- he meant schooling-- and mass media.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.300]   People," he informed his readers,
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   "are only little plastic lumps of dough."
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.300]   Another insider of modern schooling, H.H. Goddard,
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.300]   chairman of the psychology department at Princeton,
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   called government schooling in 1920, quote,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:44.300]   "the perfect organization of the hive," close quote.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   Goddard wrote that standardized testing was
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   to cause the lower classes to confront
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   their biological inferiority, sort of like wearing a dunce
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   cap.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   In time, it would discourage their reproduction.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:07.300]   By 1971, the US Office of Education,
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   now deeply committed to gaining access
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   to the private lives and thoughts of children,
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   granted contracts for seven volumes of so-called change
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   agent studies to the Rand Corporation.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   Change agent training was launched with federal funding
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   under the Education Professions Development Act.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.300]   Soon, the Change Agent's Guide to Innovation in Education
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   appeared.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   Grants were then awarded to colleges
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.300]   for the training of change agents,
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   while six more Rand manuals were printed and distributed
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.300]   to teacher training courses.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.300]   In 1989, a senior director of the Mid-Continent Regional
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   Education Laboratory told the 50 governors of the United States
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.300]   assembled in Kansas City for their annual meeting
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.300]   the following-- this is a direct quote,
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   not a word is changed-- "what we're into
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   is the total restructuring of scientific scholarship,
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   specifically the importation of German research university
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.300]   values to America at the end of the 19th century
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.300]   covered the track of what was going on."
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   What American colleges had traditionally
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   thought about college work is that it
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.300]   was about teaching and learning.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.300]   It was about individual student growth in intellect.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   But that's not the way the German system worked.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   What a German research university was about
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.300]   was direct service to corporations
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   in the political state using students
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   who paid for the right to donate their services free,
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.300]   along with the paid professional academics.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   In return for demonstrating, a student demonstrating that he
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.300]   or she had trained adequately and was loyal,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   the German system then reserved jobs and professional licenses
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   for the appropriate graduates.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   The University of Chicago, Stanford, Johns Hopkins,
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.300]   Columbia Teachers College, MIT, and Cornell,
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.300]   all colleges endowed by great industrialists,
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.300]   together with the state-endowed university movement represented
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   by schools like Michigan or Wisconsin or Ohio State,
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   joined in concert with the old line
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.300]   aristocratic American colleges like Yale and Dartmouth,
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.300]   who were flag bearers for the English social class theory
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.300]   to provide a new and daring purpose for wealth
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   to aspire to, not just spending your money,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   not just having big parties, but mastering
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   the secrets of evolution and driving society
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   toward a managed scientific utopia.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   Indiana University-- I don't believe--
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   I've never encountered this piece of information,
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.300]   which I dug up.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   I had been asked to speak at a conference in San Francisco
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.300]   by the Cato Institute last year called the Bionomics Conference.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:29.300]   And there were so many-- it was at the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.300]   The only reason I went was so I never
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   would have been able to afford to stay at the Mark Hopkins.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.300]   And I took my cat and smuggled it into the room.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:46.300]   We had four days of-- anyway, there
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.300]   were so many references at this conference to evolution
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.300]   that I said, what is this cockamamie bionomics?
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.300]   And I started to search and hunt.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.300]   And I stumbled across it.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.800]   And you're about to get it now.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   But you and I and the Bionomics Conference people
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.300]   must be the only people in the world who know this.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.300]   Indiana University provides a good picture
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.300]   of the strategy developing outside the irrelevant debate
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   conducted in the public press.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:25.300]   By 1900, a special discipline existed at Indiana only
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.800]   for elite students handpicked by the college president who
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.300]   had created and taught the course.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.300]   It was called bionomics.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.300]   And it dealt with the why and how
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.300]   of producing a new evolutionary ruling class.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.300]   The president of the college is a famous name
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.300]   in American college history.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.300]   His name is David Starr Jordan.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.300]   And Jordan did so well in the middle of nowhere,
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.300]   he was soon invited to join the major leagues of university
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.300]   existence.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:03.300]   The invitation was extended by railroad tycoon Leland Stanford.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:07.300]   And Jordan became the first president
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.300]   of Stanford University, where he remained for 30 years.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   But what, you might say, does this
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   have to do with public schooling?
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.300]   Just this.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.300]   Bionomics gets its direct connection
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   with forced government schooling in this fashion.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.300]   When he left Indiana, Jordan took along with him
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:32.300]   to Stanford his star bionomics protege, a 24-year-old named
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.300]   Elwood Cumberley.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   And in short order, Cumberley was made dean of teacher
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.300]   education at Stanford.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   Within two decades, he was the head of a syndicate
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   controlling school administrative posts
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   from coast to coast.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.300]   He was the most influential schoolman
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.300]   in 20th century American history.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   He was also the official historian
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   of American schooling.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   All the myths you've heard come from Cumberley's history
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.300]   of American education, which for 50 years
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   was the dominant textbook in teacher training institutions.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.300]   Did bionomics have any effect on life in the state of Indiana,
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   where so many sons of prominent Indiana families
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   had studied its arguments for controlled breeding
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.300]   and elimination of the unfit?
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.300]   The answer is yes.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.300]   The very first formal legislation making forced
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.300]   sterilization by the state a legal act
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   was passed in the state of Indiana.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   And its practice there became the law of the land
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   in the famous 1927 Supreme Court test case, Buck versus Bell,
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.300]   in which Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the majority opinion,
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:58.300]   allowing the sterilization of 17-year-old Carrie Buck
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.300]   to prevent her from having degenerate offspring.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:07.300]   That's a quote from the Supreme Court decision.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.300]   20 years later-- I've never met anybody who knows this.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.300]   So if someone in here knew this, could you just sort of raise
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.300]   your hands.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   I'll know that someone in the world knows this.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.300]   20 years later, after Buck versus Bell,
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.300]   in the trial of the German doctors at Nuremberg
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.300]   after the Second World War, the Nazi physicians
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:35.300]   testified that their precedents were importantly American ones
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.300]   and that their name for forced sterilization
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.300]   had been the Indiana procedure.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:47.300]   To say this bionomical spirit infected schooling
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.300]   is to say that birds fly.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:55.300]   Once you know it's there, the principle is easily tracked.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.300]   I'm going to track a little bit of it for you
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.300]   so that the groove will be worn, and you'll
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   find that you'll be able to add components to this track
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.300]   very easily just reading the press and watching television.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.300]   In 1922, Walter Lippman's book Public Opinion
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.300]   demanded severe restrictions on public debate.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.300]   Those are Lippman's words.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.300]   In light of the enormous number of feeble-minded Americans,
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:25.300]   said Lippman, the old ideal of participatory democracy
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.300]   is insane.
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.300]   This theme of scientifically controlled breeding
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.300]   interacted in a complex fashion with the German ideal
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   of a scientific society run by experts
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.300]   and the ideal of the British state religion
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.300]   and political society that God himself
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.300]   had appointed the social classes to create
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   a kind of Darwinian caste-based schooling run at long distance
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   through experts unseen who manipulated hired hands called
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.300]   schoolteachers and school administrators.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.300]   And all this was for the ultimate good
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.300]   of the best breeding stock.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.300]   In 1928, Sigmund Freud's favorite nephew,
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:15.300]   Edward L. Bernays, who is the creator of the craft that we
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:20.300]   call today public relations, said in his book Crystallizing
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   Public Opinion that, quote, "Invisible power is now
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.300]   in control of every aspect of American life.
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   Democracy," said Bernays, "is only a front
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.300]   for skillful wire-pulling, tricks the new sciences
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.300]   of mental manipulation, could place at the disposal
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.300]   of policy people for a price."
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:48.300]   By 1944, the jettisoning of natural rights
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:52.300]   resonated through every corner of American academic life.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.300]   Any academic who expected free money from foundations,
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   corporations, or government would
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.300]   play the scientific management string on his loot.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:08.300]   In 1961, the German concept of the political state
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   as a fatherland surfaced in John F. Kennedy's inaugural address
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.300]   in which his listeners were lectured,
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   "Ask not what your country can do for you,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   but what you can do for your country."
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:28.300]   And in 1995, Time magazine-- I believe it's February,
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   the first issue in February-- lectured its readers
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.300]   in a cover story that, quote, "Democracy
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   is in the worst interest of national goals.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.300]   The modern world is too complex to allow the man or woman
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   in the street to interfere in its management."
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   Now the secret was in the open.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:51.300]   The original American commonwealth ideal
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.300]   had been repudiated by its guardians.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.300]   In the same year, some of the methodology
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   used to achieve this repudiation was brought to light
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.300]   in a long documentary film, which I'll
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   bet shows around Nashville.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.300]   It's called Manufacturing Consent.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:13.300]   It was about the career of the legendary MIT professor Noam
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:17.300]   Chomsky, the world's foremost linguistic scholar.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.300]   But Chomsky's interests haven't been in linguistics
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.300]   for at least 20 years.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:28.300]   In the film, Chomsky confirmed a growing popular suspicion
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.300]   that the news you hear is tightly controlled.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.300]   He showed that all the news in the world,
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.300]   pouring through mass channels, is
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.300]   under the direction of 23 global corporations, which
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   spread propaganda on every side of every issue,
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:48.300]   thus constricting public imagination,
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   wherever important interests are in question.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   School was an important terminal on a production line
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.300]   to create a utopian world resembling a gigantic Epcot
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.300]   Center, or perhaps the Mother Chautauqua
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   of late 19th century fame, a utopia before its time.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.300]   There was only one important eugenical limitation
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.300]   on this school-created utopia to come.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:19.300]   It wasn't intended for everyone, at the most
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:23.300]   for 20% of the existing population.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:28.300]   And out of Johns Hopkins University in 1996
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   came this chilling piece of supporting data.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.300]   I'm going to quote from the Hopkins report.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:41.300]   "The American economy has grown massively since the mid 1960s,
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:45.300]   but workers' real spendable wages are no higher
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.300]   than they were 30 years ago.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   The purchasing power of a working couple in 1995
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.300]   was, after inflation was factored in,
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:04.300]   the same as earned by a single working man 90 years earlier."
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:10.300]   This steep decline in American common prosperity
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.300]   then forced both parents from home
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.300]   and forced their kids into the managed world of daycare
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   and extended schooling.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:23.300]   And although you and I have been harangued endlessly
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   century long that enlarging the scope of schooling
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.300]   would cause wealth to be more evenly spread,
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.300]   exactly the reverse has occurred.
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:40.300]   Wealth was 250% more concentrated by 1998
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.300]   than it was in 1898.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.300]   "I don't mean to be inflammatory," he said,
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   "but it's as if government school has made people dumber,
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:55.300]   not brighter, made families weaker, not stronger,
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:57:00.300]   has ruined formal religion with its hard-sell exclusion of God,
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.300]   has set the class structure in stone
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:06.300]   by dividing children into classes
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.300]   and setting them against one another,
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:12.300]   and has been midwife to an alarming concentration
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   of wealth and power in the hands of a fraction
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.300]   of our national community."
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.300]   Real school reform would have to overthrow
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.300]   a powerful form of mental conditioning
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.300]   which has taken a century to implant.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.300]   To one degree or another, all of us
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.300]   have been indoctrinated in a variety of ways
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.300]   to believe that the American experiment which promised
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:40.300]   ordinary people sovereignty over their own lives
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.300]   was wrong-headed and childish.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.300]   Real school reform would have to defeat the belief
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:50.300]   learned in school and reinforced through the media
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:54.300]   that ordinary people are too stupid, too irresponsible,
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:59.300]   too childish to be trusted to look out for themselves.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.300]   When children are encouraged to run wild in school
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:07.300]   and to become stupid there, this poisonous lesson
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.300]   is hammered home for the rest of us day after day.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.300]   We've all experienced it.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.300]   No wonder we all believe it.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.300]   The premises of scientific schooling
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.300]   seem impossible to dispute.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   So thoroughly have they been demonstrated
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.300]   by the form of forced schools which
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   corporations and the federal government imposed on us
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.300]   a century ago.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:35.300]   After all, why should hopelessly ignorant people
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.300]   be allowed to make decisions, even intimate personal ones
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.300]   like how to raise their own children?
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.300]   Certified experts are available who
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.300]   know vastly more about everything and anything.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.300]   Thus has the Protestant Reformation,
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:57.300]   whose brightest product was America,
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.300]   been thrown on the scrap heap.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   Because if there's any bedrock of the Protestant Reformation,
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:10.300]   it was Luther's declaration, every man his own priest.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.300]   Jefferson and Madison must have been loony
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.300]   to want us to trust the common people.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:20.300]   Now let me take in conclusion a stab at a reply.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:25.300]   To have better schools that served families and communities
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.300]   and individuals, instead of suffocating them,
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.300]   we would need to trash certain assumptions.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   We would need to abandon entirely the idea
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:40.300]   that any such sociological reality as mass man
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:44.300]   actually exists, except in the minds of those who benefit
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.300]   from such a belief.
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   We would have to believe what our fingerprints
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   and our intuition tell us, that no two people are alike,
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.300]   that nobody can be accurately described by numbers and graphs,
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:03.300]   that trying to do this sets up an endless chain of future grief.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.300]   We would have to accept that a fantasy like scientific pedagogy
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.300]   is impossible because each person has
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.300]   a private and a singular destiny.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:19.300]   We would need to transfer faith from school and corporate experts
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.300]   and behave as if these principles were true,
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:27.300]   as over a million homeschooling families in this country do.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.300]   We would need to wake up and admit that knowledge
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:35.300]   is a far cry from wisdom, that each American has the right
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:40.300]   to live as he or she deems wise, and if the way individuals
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.300]   choose to live and raise their kids means disaster
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.300]   for global corporations, as surely the way of life
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   the Amish embraced, if it were embraced by too many,
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.300]   would mean disaster, then that fateful choice
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.300]   still needs to be honored because it is protected
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:03.300]   by the law that defines America, our founding documents.
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.300]   It's high time we all remembered what mankind needed
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.300]   and America for in the first place.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.300]   The brilliant dialectical balance struck by our founders
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.300]   was the only way to keep power weak and off balance,
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.300]   official power and popular power both.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:26.300]   Popular will would beat back government tyranny,
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   government would check popular tyranny over minority rights.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   This constant confrontation, this unwinnable war
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   between two flawed collectivizing principles,
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   coercive government and bullying public opinion,
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.300]   will always produce liberty for those who want it.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.300]   In the stalemate, liberty escapes as long as the argument
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.300]   is kept alive.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.300]   It's only through enforced consensus, the product of too much
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:05.300]   and the wrong kind of schooling, that America can fail.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   America is about argument, about doing things our own way.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.300]   It is still the only place on the planet where one can publicly
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   oppose authority without being beaten or killed
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.300]   or severely intimidated for that act of free will.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:27.300]   The U.S. Supreme Court wrote in the flag burning case
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:32.300]   that the only true test of freedom is the right to differ
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   about things that touch the heart of the existing order.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:41.300]   And the court was right. That truly is the standard.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.300]   Let us strike to the heart of this thing then
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   and take back our children from the management engineers.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.300]   Thank you very much.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   [applause]
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.300]   Thank you. Thank you all.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   Thank you. God bless you all.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   [applause]
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.300]   Thank you.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.300]   [applause]
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.300]   Well, you just heard what my publisher doesn't want
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.300]   the rest of the country to hear.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.300]   They really had, they've kept my book for a year.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:31.300]   I mean, they want the book, but they don't want the quotes
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:37.300]   from the foundation documents and from the various social engineers,
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.300]   which are pretty easy to trace once you know they're there.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.300]   Anyway.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.300]   Thank you. See you tomorrow morning.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   [applause]
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:04:08.300]   [music]
