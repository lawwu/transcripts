[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Hello again, and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John with longtime pastor and author
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560]   John Piper.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.800]   By God's grace, this is a podcast that's heard around the world by a lot of different people,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   and that means when we dive into the most sensitive fears and the most painful wounds
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.540]   of a life, we're only doing so at a very principled level.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.280]   We offer scriptural pointers.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.600]   We're trying to point you into your Bible.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.580]   We're never trying to replace the necessary pastors and counselors and Christian friends
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.820]   that God has put in your life that you need for face-to-face care.
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.820]   That's irreplaceable.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.960]   And with that said, a really painful email has arrived from a man in England who writes
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.440]   this, "Pastor John, how can I forgive my parents?
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.320]   I've been a Christian for 17 years but struggle with forgiveness of my parents for my abusive
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320]   childhood.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.440]   I know that the Lord teaches forgiveness as does the Bible in many passages.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460]   I am able to forgive others' injustices and wrongs, but I really struggle with memories
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.960]   of my childhood and it brings resentment to mind.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.960]   Not only forgiveness is taught in the Bible, but also it says I should honor my parents.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.080]   I feel like a failure as a Christian.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.160]   I am 47 years old with a family of my own and I feel such resentment, even hate and
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.320]   rage sometimes at my parents for the physical and mental abuse I suffered at their hands.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.800]   Please help me to understand how I can get peace over this matter and try to forgive
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.960]   them, a forgiveness that lasts for all time, not just until another memory surfaces."
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.440]   Pastor John, what would you say to this listener?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.280]   I have three practical suggestions based on Scripture, but first, let me say how utterly
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.000]   crucial I think this issue is, and I'm glad, so glad that it's been asked.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.400]   Jesus teaches that an unforgiving heart is an unforgiven heart.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.280]   Let me say that again.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.840]   Jesus teaches that an unforgiving heart is an unforgiven heart.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320]   Here's what he says.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   "Father, forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors."
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.080]   Make it correspond.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.520]   He follows up with this, "If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.880]   will forgive you.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.000]   If you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.960]   That's Matthew 6, 14 and 15.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.200]   Then in Matthew 18, you remember, he tells the parable of the unforgiving servant, and
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.640]   that makes the same point.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   So all that just to say this is serious.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   Here are my three suggestions.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.560]   Number one, Colossians 3, 13, "Forgive each other as the Lord has forgiven you, so you
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.320]   also must forgive."
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:01.440]   In other words, being able and willing to forgive grows out from the root of being forgiven.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:10.560]   How amazing, how precious, how humbling does being forgiven make you feel?
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.880]   If you're forgiven, how amazed are you that you are forgiven?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   Let me use a picture.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.720]   Picture that you are a traitor to a gracious and good king.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.840]   You're a traitor.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.040]   And in your evil, you are planning to kill the king.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   He's a good king.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.000]   He hasn't done anything to bring this on.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.240]   You still want to submit.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.340]   You dig a tunnel under the castle and begin to stock it with dynamite.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.040]   He finds out about your treachery.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   And on the day you plan to blow it up, blow the king up and kill him, he follows you into
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.080]   the tunnel.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.120]   You light the fuse to the dynamite.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.240]   But as you're running out to get out so that you won't be blown up, you fall and gash an
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.560]   artery in your leg.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.440]   The bleeding is so bad as you try to limp your way out, you become faint and collapse.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   He sees you.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   And instead of running out himself to save his life, he picks you up and carries you
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.480]   towards safety.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   And just before you reach safety, the explosion loses a beam, which falls on the king and
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.160]   kills him as he pushes you to safety.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   So there you are standing free and your leg with a tourniquet on it and the king dead
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.600]   having saved your life.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.960]   And a sense of exhilaration at being alive comes over you, a sense of shame at what you
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.320]   have done comes over you.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:53.000]   And my question is, in that moment of life, I'm alive, what a horrible thing I have done.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.560]   In that moment, how would you feel about your parents?
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:09.600]   My own experience is that in the moments of worship, when I feel most guilty at the horror
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:20.240]   of my own sin against God, against Jesus, and when I feel most amazed at my own forgiveness
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:28.520]   and most stunned at the magnitude of what it cost in Jesus' suffering, I am least likely
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.440]   to be angry at those moments with those who have wronged me.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   It just doesn't fit.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.080]   It just doesn't fit.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.040]   I can't do it.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.360]   I can't seethe with revenge and celebrate being forgiven.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   I can't.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   It won't work.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.840]   So my suggestion is linger long and deep over the cost and the hope, the preciousness, the
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.400]   amazing wonder of being forgiven at the cost of Christ.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280]   That's my first suggestion.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.780]   Second suggestion.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.440]   This comes from my devotions yesterday morning.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.640]   This very question was on my mind when I read this.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.400]   This is the trial of Jesus.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.960]   The high priest asked Jesus, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.880]   And Jesus said, "I am."
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.920]   And you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the power and coming in
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.200]   the clouds of heaven.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.600]   And the high priest tore his garments and said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.800]   You have heard what he said.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.900]   Blasphemy.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.080]   What is your decision?"
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.040]   And they all condemned him as deserving death.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:51.640]   And then these words, "And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and strike him,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:57.320]   to put a hood over his face and then struck him, saying, 'Prophesy.'
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.800]   And the guards received him with blows."
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.240]   And I just paused and I was on the brink of tears.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.360]   This doesn't usually happen to me when I'm all by myself, but on the brink of tears.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.600]   And I said, "How could he not strike back?
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.280]   How could he not strike back?
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.720]   I get so angry when people do bad things to me that I want to strike back so quickly.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.920]   How could he not?"
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.480]   And the answerâ€”I mean, it was a real question in the early church, how he could not.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.800]   And Peter gave one of the answers.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.340]   It goes like this in 1 Peter 2.21, "Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.340]   you might follow in his steps.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.280]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.580]   When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.400]   When he suffered, he did not threaten."
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.200]   Here's what he did.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.720]   "But he continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly."
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   In other words, even when your own judicial sentiment rises up and demands that there
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:15.920]   be justice because of the wrong that's done to you, you can roll that over onto the judge
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.120]   who judges justly, and you don't have to bear the awful weight of being the judge and
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.240]   the avenger yourself.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.300]   You can trust that justice will be done.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.760]   Punishment will happen in hell or will have happened on the cross.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.080]   Sinners will bear it, or Christ will bear it.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:45.500]   You cannot improve upon the justice of God in Christ's crucifixion or in hell.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.560]   So you can let it go.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   Let it go.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560]   Vengeance is mine.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   I will repay, says the Lord.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.160]   And here's my third suggestion.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.980]   Ponder that an unforgiving spirit hurts you more than anyone.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.980]   It does no good.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.280]   In fact, it does a lot of harm to you and not to others.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.360]   You might say, "Oh, that kind of argument.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.100]   I've heard that kind of argument before.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.440]   It just has no power.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.640]   It's a powerless argument just to tell me that my emotions that are rising up within
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   me do me no good.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.040]   That's a useless argument, Piper."
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:26.320]   And my response to that is, "Jesus didn't think it was useless, and you better be careful."
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:33.560]   Because he used that very argument against the sin of anxiety, which has the same power
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.060]   rising up within us as resentment does.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.900]   He said in Matthew 6, 27, "Which of you by being anxious can add a single cubit to
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.560]   his span of life?"
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.380]   In other words, it doesn't do any good to be anxious.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.260]   It's not going to do you any good.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.780]   And if you respond to Jesus by saying, "That's a useless argument," woe to you.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.540]   Don't talk to Jesus like that.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.740]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.820]   It's a useful argument.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.940]   Don't blow it off.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.940]   Ask the Lord to make it powerful.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.680]   This is doing me no good.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.620]   This is hurting me.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:15.980]   God, use that insight to take the power of this resentment away from me.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:23.620]   So those are my three strategies that God has given you to overcome the destructive
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.860]   effects of resentment and bitterness.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.260]   Number one, be amazed at your own forgiveness, the magnitude of it, and what it costs.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:38.220]   Two, let the all-wise judge settle accounts for you so you don't have to bear that awful
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.220]   load.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:45.140]   Three, ponder deeply that an unforgiving spirit hurts you more than anyone.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.620]   We get a lot of very personal emails, as you can imagine.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.820]   We obviously cannot plunge into the details with you of your life and your story like
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.820]   a pastor can.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.280]   We do our best to stay at the principal level, and that's what this podcast does best.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.540]   Thank you for listening.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.780]   To search or browse our past episodes or to send us a new question of your own, you can
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:11.540]   go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.540]   Well Jesus was never ashamed to tell his disciples or his potential disciples to liquidate all
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.700]   of their assets and to give away all of their cash first.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.380]   So is that same expectation put to disciples today?
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.180]   It's a really, really good question, and I think every serious Bible reader and every
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.820]   serious follower of Jesus has to wrestle with that question.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.620]   We'll see you back here next time on Friday.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.620]   Amen.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:36.620]   Amen.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.620]   Amen.
