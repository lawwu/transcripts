[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600]   And today we have an anonymous question in the inbox.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   Here it is, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.700]   Pastor John, I've heard you say that while you were working on your doctoral dissertation
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.880]   about Jesus' command to love your enemies, you read a lot of scholars who argued against
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.600]   being motivated to love by the promise of reward.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.760]   And you said that this is simply unbiblical, that Jesus and the apostles motivate love
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.780]   all the time by encouraging us to pursue our own greater happiness.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.240]   My question is, how then can that be love?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.360]   How is this not just using other people for our own selfish ends?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.920]   Didn't Paul say, "Love seeks not its own" in 1 Corinthians 13, verse 5?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.680]   Pastor John, what would you say to these questions?
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.400]   I think that this is one of the most important questions that can be asked in the Christian
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.600]   life.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.340]   We really need to settle it, whether we're going to feel guilty for being motivated by
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.260]   the promises of joy in God's presence that he offers us as a motivation for sacrifice
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.820]   in this world.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.020]   This is absolutely huge.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:27.420]   The Bible is full of commands to love people at cost to ourselves.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.400]   We are often called to make great sacrifices in this world, even risking our lives or intentionally
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.020]   laying them down for others.
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.900]   If the Bible offers us motivations and incentives to do this by promising that there will be
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.260]   great reward because of it, and we think it's ethically inferior to be motivated that way,
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.940]   then we're going to turn away from the very strength that God offers us in the cause of
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.940]   love.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940]   So that's serious.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.220]   We're not dabbling on the edge of things here.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.260]   We're talking about the very center of motivation for Christian living.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:17.220]   Jesus said, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.000]   brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors, lest they should invite you in return and
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.160]   you be repaid.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.820]   But when you give a feast, invite the poor and the crippled and the lame and the blind,
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.260]   and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you."
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.180]   And then he adds this, "For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just."
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.200]   That's Luke 14, 12 to 14.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.220]   Jesus didn't add that last promise for nothing.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.500]   It begins with the word "for," because you will be blessed in making sacrifices in this
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.580]   world to love others because you'll be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.580]   He intends for that to be a motivation, an incentive, a strengthening.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.800]   We're not seeking payback here on the earth.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.980]   That's the whole point.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.780]   It's costly to love others.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.820]   It's thankless many times to love others.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.540]   The payback is later, at the resurrection of the just.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.740]   And yes, I did continually run into this kind of thing when I was working on my dissertation.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.900]   I read scholar after scholar who said the opposite.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.660]   I'll give you one concrete example.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.660]   I won't name him.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.900]   I'll just give you the exact quote, and it's in his commentary on Luke 14 that I just read,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.380]   and he says this, "The promise of reward for this kind of life is there as a fact.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.220]   You don't live this way for the sake of the reward.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.980]   If you do that, you're not living in the new way, but the old selfish way."
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.740]   Now, I believe that is simply wrong, and not only wrong, but damaging, damaging to the
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.100]   cause of love.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:20.500]   Jesus gave that promise of reward at the resurrection, reward at the resurrection of the just precisely
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.980]   to motivate us.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.820]   If that scholar were right, we would have to work to keep the promise out of our minds
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.900]   so that it wouldn't contaminate our motivation.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.180]   But Jesus tells us to do just the opposite.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.060]   In Acts 20.35, Paul is talking to the elders, and he quotes Jesus.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.060]   One of the few places where Jesus is quoted outside the Gospels in Acts 20.35, he says
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:00.100]   this, "We must help the weak, remembering"—now, that's the word I'm fastening on, not forgetting—"remembering
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.100]   the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.880]   Now, that scholar would say, "No, no, no, no.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.100]   You shouldn't be constantly remembering that as you try to do good to people.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100]   Remember that.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100]   It's more blessed.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   It's more blessed.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100]   You should forget that.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.660]   Keep that out of your mind because, yes, it's true, but it's going to contaminate your motivation
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.100]   if you keep remembering it."
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.460]   So I'm going to go with Jesus here and not that scholar.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.460]   Jesus emphasizes, "Keep it in your mind.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.240]   Remember, remember, it is more blessed to give than to receive.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.940]   Keep the blessing in mind."
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:46.620]   And then he said in Luke 6.35, "Love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.820]   in return, and your reward will be great."
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.700]   So in other words, just like Luke 14, don't expect payback now.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.940]   They're going to kill you, for goodness sakes.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.760]   They're going to malign you and torture you and kill you, so expect trouble and affliction
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.900]   and ingratitude in this world, but oh, oh, remember, your reward will be great.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.220]   Let that sustain you through it all.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.460]   I think this is the explanation for what Paul meant.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.460]   The questioner asked about 1 Corinthians 13.5, what Paul meant in 1 Corinthians 13.5 when
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.780]   he said, "Love seeks not its own."
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.940]   That's the old King James Version, I guess.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.940]   Love seeks not its own.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.660]   It's a good literal translation.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:48.000]   He did not mean that love should find no pleasure in or look for any pleasure from the beautiful
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.480]   act of love.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.980]   He meant don't look for that reward by using people for material gain or advancement in
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.140]   this world.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.500]   He didn't mean ignore the promise of great reward in heaven, and the reason we know this
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.220]   from 1 Corinthians 13, not just from the words of Jesus, but from the very context, two verses
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:19.740]   earlier, Paul says, "If I give away all that I have and deliver my body to be burned, but
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   have not love, I gain nothing.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.700]   I gain nothing.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.940]   I gain nothing."
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:33.420]   The whole argument is you would be a fool to live in a way that gains nothing.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.060]   And that's the exact point.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.900]   You gain a great reward through giving your life for other people.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.640]   So he's motivating love by long-term gain, not short-term profit, by manipulating people
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.900]   to get richer or to get famous or anything like that.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.940]   So C.S. Lewis, you know this, Tony.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.380]   We love this quote from his great sermon, what's the name of the sermon?
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.380]   The Weight of Glory.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.960]   The Weight of Glory, yes, that's right.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   The Weight of Glory.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.520]   "If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and earnestly
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:20.420]   to hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I submit that this has crept in through Immanuel
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.820]   Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:36.340]   rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.820]   strong but too weak."
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.460]   I remember the first time I read that I thought, "Oh, unbelievable.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.900]   I can't believe he's saying this.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.900]   This is so right."
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:50.620]   "We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.100]   joy is offered us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in the slum
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.420]   because he cannot imagine what is meant by a holiday at the sea.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.140]   We are far too easily pleased."
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.020]   So the crucial question is, how is this love?
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:14.620]   And I've got two short and I think simple and I hope compelling answers for why is it
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.740]   love to be motivated to love people, to sacrifice for people, give your life for people for
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.020]   the sake of reward?
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.940]   Answer number one, there is nothing morally inferior about looking for reward for our
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:37.100]   behavior provided that the reward is ultimately more of Christ as the supreme joy of our souls.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.060]   And the reason that's not morally inferior is that Christ is most glorified in us when
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.740]   we're most satisfied in Christ.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.740]   The glory of Christ is at stake.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.620]   It's simply not virtue.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.820]   It's not an honor to Christ to say, I can imagine somebody trying to say this, "Well,
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:02.520]   I'm going to suffer for Christ and it makes no difference to me whether it leads to knowing
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.140]   and enjoying Christ better."
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.020]   That's not a virtue.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.060]   That's self-sufficiency cloaked as a sacrifice.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.060]   It is right.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:19.820]   It is a great honor to Christ to be motivated by a desire for more of him that comes through
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.500]   loving people.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   Here's the last one.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.660]   This is probably the most important.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:30.180]   It is loving to sacrifice for others with a view to reward, wanting reward, aiming at
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:40.860]   reward if our aim is that in being sustained by this reward of more of Christ, we win people
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.100]   to come with us into the reward.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.380]   That's the goal.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.380]   That's the goal.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.660]   And we can't do that if we don't love the reward.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.940]   There would be nothing to welcome these people into, to entice them into, if we have stopped
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.460]   delighting in the very reward we get through loving others.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.500]   So 1 Peter 2 says, "Conduct yourselves among the Gentiles in an honorable way, so that
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:09.020]   when they speak evil against you, they may see your good deeds."
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:16.900]   And then, I'm paraphrasing now, "Join you in glorifying God on the day of visitation."
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:27.600]   Our motive is never—mark this—our motive is never to return good for evil so that we
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.220]   get the reward and they don't.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.800]   Let me say that again.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:43.580]   My motive in returning to someone good for evil is never, "I get a reward, you don't."
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.620]   I want them—my motive is in seeking to love them.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.980]   I want them to join me.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:56.020]   I want them to see in my very behavior the all-satisfying worth of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:03.740]   So my conclusion is never, never, never forget, but always remember, remember that it is more
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.940]   blessed to give than to receive.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.500]   Your reward will be great in heaven.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.620]   No matter the cost of love here, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just,
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:21.660]   and a great and wonderful part of that reward will be that in loving people like this, you
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.820]   will win many of them to join you in enjoying the reward.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.180]   Yes, precious motive for Christian charity.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.580]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.060]   And speaking of glorious themes in the Bible, J.I.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.220]   Packer, in his magnificent book, Knowing God, wrote this, "If you want to judge how well
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.220]   a person understands Christianity, find out how much he makes of the thought of being
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.620]   God's child."
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.620]   Precious.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:52.300]   So just how key is the theme of sonship in our faith and in our Bibles?
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.020]   I'm going to call up Don Carson.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.620]   He's going to explain, and that is on the podcast tomorrow.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.940]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.980]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   Piper.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   We'll see you tomorrow.
