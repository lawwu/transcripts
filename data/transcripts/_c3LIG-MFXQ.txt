[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Here's an email question. "Pastor John, in moments of public tragedy, how do you
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.600]   reconcile your own compassion for those who suffer and also hold firmly to God's
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.400]   sovereignty, knowing that what has happened was ultimately governed by God?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.600]   It seems this is a huge tension theologically when the suffering
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.760]   happens. Just personally speaking, how far do you affirm in your own heart the
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.000]   determining will of God when you see the tragedy unfold in the news?"
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.600]   My understanding of the question now is not so much what I'm saying in public,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.480]   but what I'm feeling in my heart and how I'm relating compassion to a
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.160]   conviction. So here's my thought. I think the question, the way it's put, if
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.720]   I understand it, is based on some assumptions that I may not share. Let me
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.680]   try to state those, and then the person who asked the question can
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.200]   see if we're on the same page. It sounds to me like one of the assumptions is
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.240]   that if one feels and speaks in his own heart about a building collapsing in
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.520]   Bangladesh with several hundred people crushed, or even as I'm talking today, a
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.960]   mental health facility in Russia burning and 38 mentally ill people being killed,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.240]   or we may remember the fertilizer plant exploding and dozens dead, or the Boston...
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.000]   I mean, it just seems like right now in our nation, event after event of
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.640]   calamity is happening. So the question for me, that they're asking me, is when I
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.320]   see that and speak to my own heart or think about it and believe that God is
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.560]   totally in control, or say to myself instinctively, "God controlled that, God
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.720]   ruled that, God either in a planning way permitted that or ordained that," then
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   this is in conflict with my compassion. It's going to be in tension with my
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.800]   compassion. Feeling compassion and feeling the sovereignty of God in its
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.160]   fullest sense are at odds. That seems to be an assumption. And my question would
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.600]   be, now why would that be? Why would a person feel that? And here's
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.560]   this, I think, a second assumption, that God's being the ultimate cause would
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.840]   somehow exclude our feeling hurt, or our weeping, or our helping, or our outrage at
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   the sin involved. God's sovereignty implicitly in their minds is
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.080]   excluding that or pushing that aside. Now I don't share either of those
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   assumptions. They're not part of my way of thinking. The second one, I think part
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.560]   of God's will in permitting or ordaining a calamity is that we weep with those
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.960]   who weep. That's part of the plan. Once you realize that God brings to pass all
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:27.560]   things, I mean all things, there are no maverick molecules, R.C. Sproul said, and
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:38.000]   that's right, or Spurgeon said, every dust moat that flies in the air, or the spray,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.640]   every little globule of spray in every harbor in the wake of every boat in the
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.240]   world is guided on its path through the air by God. Once you get to the point of
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:59.480]   believing the providence and sovereignty of God to that extent, then you see that
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:08.880]   God intends for weeping, the abhorrence of evil, the rescue of the perishing, the
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.920]   healing of the brokenhearted, to be a part of his plan, even as he may plan the
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.640]   collapse of a building, or the explosion of a building, or an earthquake, or a flood.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.560]   When Jesus met the man who was born blind, people said, "Okay, who sinned? This
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.640]   man or his parents?" And Jesus answered, "It's neither. This man was born blind for
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.840]   the glory of God." Now what's that mean? It means that when God ordained that this
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.720]   man endure dozens probably--I don't know how old he was, let's say he was 30--30 years
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.160]   of blindness, he was also willing that there be some responses to it of a
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:09.840]   certain kind. And the shepherds who were caring for him in the synagogue had the
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.600]   wrong kind, because when he got healed, he didn't even rejoice! They had hearts
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.240]   that were terrible! And Jesus wanted people to rejoice, and to see God, and to
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.920]   glorify God. And I don't doubt that Jesus wanted 30 years worth of kind and
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.880]   faithful parenting from his parents. Like many parents today have
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.800]   disabled children, and what is God's purpose? Well, one of his purposes is that
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.920]   beautiful demonstrations of compassion be shown from these parents. So the point
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   is this. If you see a calamity and you know God could have stopped it, which he
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.320]   always could, and he didn't stop it, so he must have a purpose in it, don't draw the
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.440]   irrational, unbiblical conclusion, "Well, therefore God wants me to feel no
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.080]   outrage over the sin of the bombers in Boston. He doesn't want me to feel any
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.360]   compassion for the victims of the building, since he brought the building
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.200]   down, and he doesn't want me to get engaged in any relief project, because he
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.600]   brought--he caused the earthquake." That's just irrational! That's crazy!
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.240]   That's a person who has gotten halfway into the Bible, and they're starting to
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.160]   draw human conclusions rather than biblical conclusions. God wills for the
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:46.320]   beautiful virtues of outrage at sin and compassion for victims and efforts of
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.720]   relief to be manifested in the midst of the calamities that he himself is in
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.880]   charge of. And maybe I'll just close with one of the most practical
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:06.240]   illustrations. It says in Acts 427 that God predestined what Herod and
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.480]   Pontius Pilate and the Gentiles and the Jews brought to pass when Jesus was
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.960]   crucified. In other words, the worst sinning that has ever happened in the
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.520]   history of the world was planned and predestined by God for the death of his
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.840]   son that we might be saved. The murder of the Son of God is the worst act in human
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:38.880]   history, and it was planned by God according to Acts 427. Now, God wills that
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:48.520]   evil for the sake of thousands of good responses. He wants us to be saved by it.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.320]   He wants us to trust this Jesus. He wanted Mary to come to the tomb with
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.240]   compassion in her heart, to put herbs, or he wanted to bless--he wanted to show
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.460]   that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were men of courage and
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.840]   godliness, because they were willing to take the body and put it in their
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   own tomb. God had all millions and millions of good and holy purposes in
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.760]   willing that this happen, so the same would be true of everything he wills in
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.440]   this world. So we should determine how we respond, not by any false human logical
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.760]   deduction that we're drawing from the sovereignty of God. We should determine
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.400]   it from what the Bible says should be our response, namely compassion and
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.560]   outrage at sin and efforts to be involved in helping bring about relief.
