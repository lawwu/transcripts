[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode we're going to talk about
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:12.040]   the benefits of big city living and why we should focus on big city living once again.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.200]   So I haven't been this excited in a very, very long time.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   For years now, I've been trying to figure out a way to escape San Francisco because
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.520]   it's been too congested, too expensive, just and too competitive.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.160]   You know, I've gone through the grind of living in New York City for a couple of years in
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.840]   San Francisco since 2001 and it hasn't been easy.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.080]   You know, I thought that generating about $200,000 a year in passive income was good
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.240]   enough, and it took me 18 years to get there.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.760]   And then I saw these articles from realtors and all that saying, well, actually you need
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   to make more to afford the median home price in San Francisco.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.800]   And the math comes out to about $300,000 a year.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   And so as parents with now two kids, trying to generate $300,000 a year in passive income
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.760]   to afford a middle class lifestyle in San Francisco just felt like too much.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.920]   It was untenable.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.680]   And I was very tired.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.880]   So I was like, okay, let's try to re-strategize.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.720]   We can try to make a little bit more money actively, but that takes away time from taking
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840]   care of our kids.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.280]   So the next best thing is to try to relocate to a lower cost area of the country.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.000]   And that place is Honolulu.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.900]   Honolulu is not exactly a cheap place to live, but it's about 30% cheaper than San Francisco.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.560]   And so if it takes $300,000 a year to raise a family of four and live a middle class lifestyle
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.800]   in San Francisco and Honolulu is 30% cheaper, well then it only takes about $200,000 a year.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.280]   And that's where we are right now.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   And I think we can make that work.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.480]   What are your thoughts about big city living, Sydney?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.920]   So we've lived here for a gosh, over a decade now, and I've come to love San Francisco,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.400]   but it's changed a lot.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.760]   And I would be thrilled if San Francisco wasn't as busy, you know, as it was before the pandemic
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   started.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.200]   It's been nice having less traffic on the road and just feeling like it's a little,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.600]   a little more easygoing.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.520]   Yeah, I remember one time I went to pick up my parents at the Oakland airport.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.540]   They had to arrive at, I don't know, 645 PM.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.240]   So that's rush hour traffic.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.560]   So I had to go across the bridge, pick them up and it took an hour and a half and that
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.020]   was nuts.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.240]   And then I had to go south sometimes to pick up some, you know, remodeling equipment for
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.520]   a bathroom and all that.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.360]   And it always, it always scared me to leave during rush hour traffic.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   And now I can drive anywhere at any time and I don't feel the stress of traffic at all.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   And it feels great.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.880]   And it also feels great, frankly, that there's not a lot of Uber drivers and Lyft drivers
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.080]   congesting the streets of San Francisco, because a lot of them would double park in major arteries
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   and just not care about anybody else.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280]   Yeah, and the other interesting thing about these rideshare drivers is so many of them
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.120]   were driving in from at least an hour away.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   To make money for the whole day.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.720]   So yeah, the irony is that they're supposed to relieve traffic.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.040]   But in actuality, there was like 40,000 more cars that came into San Francisco because
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.680]   of Uber and Lyft.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.520]   And they denied saying, oh, we're not causing any traffic jams.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   But you could just see it as plain as day for anybody driving.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.960]   So there seems to be a mass hysteria now, or big hype from the media and from other
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.640]   people saying that big city living is dead or it's on the demise because of working from
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.640]   home.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.360]   And I was thinking about that a lot because I know media, you know, financial samurai
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.120]   is a type of media.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.000]   And I know how media likes to, you know, whip people up in a frenzy and create this kind
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.920]   of hysteria so more people can read.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.280]   And for those who don't live in big cities, which is probably like half the population,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.320]   I think there's like this, aha, it's our turn now where we're going to, you know, rule the
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   world.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.520]   And I feel that there's, it's just gotten overboard again now about the demise of big
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   cities.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520]   What do you think?
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.440]   There's no way big cities are going to go away.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.640]   I think as you're saying, big media, the news you see on TV and online, they're trying to
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.120]   get people to read what they're saying.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120]   But it's overblown.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.760]   There's no way the cities are going to go away.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.480]   So I'm really pumped because again, I've been trying for years to figure out a way to live
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.820]   a better lifestyle with the income and the wealth that we have.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.760]   So one way is to go, you know, eventually go to Honolulu.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.920]   And that plan was to go to Honolulu in 2022 when our son is eligible for kindergarten,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.480]   we'd apply to various schools there, or maybe go to a public school.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.200]   And then we'll hopefully stick with those schools, which are actually cheaper than schools
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.520]   here in San Francisco.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   And they're from K to 12.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.400]   And it'll be a great lifestyle.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.600]   I would love to be in Honolulu for 12 years.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.960]   Oh, yeah, it's a fantastic place to go.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.160]   We've been there so many times.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.480]   And it's very family friendly.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.600]   And I also love the idea of getting into a school at kindergarten that you can stay at
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.880]   through 12th grade.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   That's huge.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.120]   Because San Francisco does not offer that.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.920]   No, it's like public or private.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.000]   You know, you got elementary and then you got middle school and then you got high schools
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   like what a pain.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   It causes so much stress to parents in the city for public and private.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.320]   And I understand the whole goal of social engineering and busing across town and stuff
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   like that.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.280]   However, there has to be a little bit better situation a system because it's clearly not
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.640]   working because the private schools have just gone the private school route and the public
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.640]   school it's total segregation.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.400]   So instead of trying to make more and moving the entire family to Honolulu, I figured,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.680]   wow, with this pandemic and the media hype and all that, we might not have to do anything
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   at all.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.200]   Sometimes the best move is to do nothing.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   And if it is true that there's gonna be a mass exodus of people out of San Francisco,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.840]   well it solves our biggest problems and our biggest issues of living in San Francisco,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   right?
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   Housing prices might soften.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.680]   Okay, that's not great for our real estate portfolio, but it allows us to upgrade to
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.840]   a nicer home because we have a larger family and if we want to get help and so forth, it'll
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.280]   be much more affordable.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   That's great.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.320]   There'll be less traffic and congestion.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.400]   There will be less competition for schools.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.180]   And I think this is one of the examples that really hit home for us.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.520]   We applied to, I think, seven preschools.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.240]   And we got rejected to six of them.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   I know.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.760]   I didn't expect that to actually happen, but it did.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   And the reason why we're okay with it is because we got accepted to our neighborhood preschool
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.120]   five minutes away from us, which we would like a lot.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.280]   And we got accepted to that school quite early.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.680]   So the rejections started rolling in six months, three to six months after we had already gotten
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.680]   accepted.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.680]   Right.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.480]   But it was just, we wanted to go through the process and we were curious to see whether,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   you know, two stay at home parents would be able to get accepted to these preschools.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.220]   And granted, these are some of the best preschools, probably the best preschools in San Francisco,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:53.480]   but to get rejected systematically one after the other was very eye opening.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.600]   It was kind of like a harbinger for what's to come because preschool, if it was that
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.520]   hard, well, it's probably going to be very hard to get into grade school and then middle
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.960]   school and then high school.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.320]   One of the reasons why I was a high school, private high school tennis coach was because
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.240]   I wanted to understand the system and see who are these people getting in.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.380]   And it's quite a homogenous group, socioeconomic and race wise.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.560]   So as two unemployed parents, stay at home parents, we're definitely at a disadvantage
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.740]   and we would need to use connections and money, you know, for donations and all that to try
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.740]   to get in.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.120]   And I don't like that system.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.520]   It feels rigged and it is rigged.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.400]   What are your thoughts?
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.600]   I agree with everything you've talked about and schools shouldn't be this hard or stressful
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   to get into.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.960]   That's one of San Francisco's weaknesses.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:51.000]   And I think that's why historically families have moved out of the city when their kids
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.960]   are approaching school age.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.120]   And the pandemic is changing a lot.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.680]   And as we talked about in a different podcast, which you can check out in the stream, we
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.040]   have decided to homeschool our son for this upcoming preschool year.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.720]   Yeah, and we'll see how it goes.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   There's two of us.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.340]   So it's not like one person has all the duty.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.080]   If we divide, you know, let's say it's two hours per parent.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.520]   Oh, a lot can be taught in four hours.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.560]   I don't know if kids can spend more than four hours learning anyway.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.240]   You do four hours and then you play for a couple hours, go eat, go to the bathroom.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.440]   And I mean, amongst that for a three year old, a lot of a lot of the teaching is involved
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   with play.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   It's not rigorous.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.200]   So one of the benefits of all this hype of the death of big cities and, you know, people
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.080]   going to smaller cities is that competition to get into school for your children will
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.080]   be less fierce.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.440]   And it's not just your kids, but yeah, actually, it's your kids.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.640]   Like after they graduate from high school, maybe they want to go to a school like Berkeley,
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:00.040]   Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Columbia, NYU, UCSF, Johns Hopkins, USC, UCLA.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.760]   All these schools are located in big cities.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.320]   And so if more people flee big cities and if more people are scared of living in big
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.520]   cities, then there's just less competition.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.200]   And for example, our preschool is actually really hard to get into.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.880]   So supposedly it's like 2% acceptance rate, whatever it is, it's not easy.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.640]   And there are some spots available now, which there were never any spots before.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:32.120]   So it's clearly great that there's less competition for the faithful who stay or the people who
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.200]   can stay.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:41.720]   Another benefit is really housing affordability for teachers, social workers, nonprofit workers,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.640]   the very fabric of America and the middle class.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.680]   I don't want to see the middle class get pushed away and have to commute 30 minutes to an
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.060]   hour just to find a job in the big city.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.400]   That really bummed me out, which is why I tried to provide subsidized rent for our preschool
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.000]   teachers and too bad it didn't work out.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.960]   But if you have falling rents, I mean, that's great.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.940]   It allows more people to afford to live in the city.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:12.960]   And when there's more diversity and more support, I think that's a great thing.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.640]   And another benefit is the opportunity to upgrade your housing.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.560]   So we've always kept our housing expense very, very low.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.680]   It's a fundamental principle to achieving financial independence to keep your housing
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.320]   to below 10 percent of your gross income.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.480]   And we've kind of gone to the extreme to that, frankly.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.520]   We paid cash for our previous house.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.140]   The cost of owning our home is less than I think it's like less than two or three percent
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.720]   of our gross income.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.240]   So we don't really even think about it.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:50.400]   But on the flip side, we've been very conservative with the way we live, our housing situation.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.480]   And with this pandemic, you know, there's not a lot of opportunity to buy homes for
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.120]   under two million dollars in San Francisco.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.680]   It's still really competitive because mortgage rates are so low.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.960]   But once you get above like the two point five million dollar range, three million dollar
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.760]   range, there's more opportunity.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.040]   And this could be an opportunity for us to expand our house now that we have two kids
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.680]   and if we hire help.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.360]   And what are your thoughts about buying a nicer, larger property to live a better life?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.400]   It's really exciting to think about that, especially with the amount of time that we're
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.480]   spending at home nowadays, you know, and it's fun to see what's out there for sure.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.960]   And I've really fallen in love with San Francisco.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.240]   I loved it when we moved here and I still love it today.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.040]   Yeah, we do have friends.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.960]   Actually, we have several friends who are all upgrading their homes to buy bigger homes,
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.280]   more space for work from home and for their kids, partly because mortgage rates are so
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.480]   low, but also because there's been so much wealth created in the stock market.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.320]   The Nasdaq is up over 35 percent in 2020.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.080]   Can you imagine that?
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.200]   I don't know if the Nasdaq would be up so much if there wasn't a pandemic.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.400]   How ironic is that?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.840]   If there wasn't a pandemic, maybe the Nasdaq would have been up, I don't know, 10 percent,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   15 percent.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.280]   But we're not talking about up 35 percent.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.800]   So if you are just crushing it in your career, you're making a lot of money in your company
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.100]   stock or your portfolio, you're probably going to convert a lot of it or some of it into
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.940]   living a better life, especially since we're spending more time at home.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.080]   So overall, I feel that there's less stress.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.800]   You know, there's less congestion.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:39.560]   There's less competition with more professional and personal opportunities and with more schooling
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.600]   options for your children and higher affordability.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.440]   All this leads to less stress, less anxiety and more livability.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.100]   So I believe that big city living has become more livable.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.120]   Just look in New York City.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.360]   There's now 67 miles of open streets where there are no cars.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.000]   Families can just ride their bikes, do their scooters, walk without the stress of cars.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.480]   It's just a much better pace of life.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.960]   And I really like that.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   And it is my belief that there is going to be a V-shaped recovery in the desire and the
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.360]   demand for big city living over the next couple of years.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.120]   It's the same thing we've seen everywhere in terms of housing demand, retail sales,
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.160]   everything, all these economic indicators.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.420]   If you take a look, you've seen a V-shaped recovery.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.800]   And I think that's the same thing is going to happen with guarding big city living.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.920]   I have friends who have gone, who've had the ability to go to a smaller city, smaller state.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.240]   They just flew with their family for three months.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   And you know what they told me?
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.780]   They said, I enjoyed it, but after three months, it's kind of like after a summer vacation,
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.320]   three months in high school, you kind of get bored and you want to get back to where your
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.120]   friends are and where your network is and just your old haunts.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.480]   And I think that's going to happen again.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.680]   It's nice to go away for a while, but to establish roots and to build relationships with new
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.200]   people takes years, if not decades, if not generations.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.160]   So when the inevitable rebound comes, if you have left the big city where your employment
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.120]   opportunity is, it may be very hard to get back in because the people who stayed will
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.240]   soak up the existing housing inventory and the existing job opportunities.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.360]   Here's one commenter who said, I'm definitely staying in a big city as well.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.120]   This is my time to get ahead by showing my loyalty and commitment to the firm and to
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.200]   the area.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.000]   The people who leave are carefully monitored and recorded by management.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Their assumption is that those who leave do not have the grit to stick things out until
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.280]   the virus is under control.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.560]   As such, they were mainly here for the money.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.200]   The opportunity for people who stay to grow is really tremendous.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   And what do you think about that in terms of management monitoring the employees who
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   flee the area or their headquarters?
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.800]   I think management pays a lot of attention to their employees that employees probably
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.840]   don't realize or even think about.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.680]   So I think that commenter is very accurate.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.520]   Right, because we all have a tendency to try to take care of the people who we like the
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.000]   best, who we see the most, who stick around the most and who just don't flee.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.960]   You know, and look, people fleeing is probably a bad word.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.400]   People who leave.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.800]   People have legitimate reasons to leave, whether it's family, affordability or whatnot.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.600]   We shouldn't punish people for leaving.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.720]   However, you know, if you're a boss, you're going to take care of the people who stayed
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   behind.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   Right.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.200]   I think that's just natural the way we do things.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.680]   So just be careful in terms of your career opportunity.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.440]   If you are planning on leaving, you know, and living wherever you want to live.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   Great.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440]   Go for it.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   That's a win win.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.160]   But just know that you might be putting yourself at a disadvantage when there is that rebound
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.760]   because the people who stay will be taken care of first.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.400]   And the other thing to note is that you might experience a income cut.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.980]   You know, I think Facebook said that they're going to cut incomes if you leave the Bay
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.760]   Area and go to a lower cost area.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.880]   I know my former employer had a similar policy where we had offices in North Carolina, I
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   think it was.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:35.040]   And so if you were to move from New York or San Francisco to the office down there, they
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.640]   would give you a salary cut.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.040]   Do you know how much?
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.020]   I don't know the details.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.560]   They never revealed the specifics, but they did say, you know, hey, we have job opportunities
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   here if you want to relocate.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.480]   However, you will have to get an adjustment.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.640]   They called it an adjustment to your salary due to the lower cost of living in that area.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.120]   So you should ask your employer before you move if there is a salary cut at all.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.200]   And if there's not, it could be a great arbitrage opportunity for you.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.160]   But again, the career advancement opportunities.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   Just be careful.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.720]   You really need to put in more effort if you're going to go remote and you're going to be
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.360]   away from the company headquarters to put more face time in, unfortunately, to stay
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.600]   top of mind.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.800]   In conclusion, I think the demise of big city living is overblown.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity, whether it's investing in real estate, rental
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   properties, buying a larger home or career opportunities that are going to be had over
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.640]   the next one to two years, because I think inevitably there's going to be a V-shaped
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.880]   recovery.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.360]   For so long, I've been planning on escaping San Francisco because it was too competitive,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.040]   too crowded and too expensive.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.140]   With some people leaving and the media instilling fear of a mass exodus, I think I can now stay
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.480]   put for longer and be happy to stay put for longer.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.440]   I mean, it's just it's kind of pain to move, even if you're moving.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   It's a lot.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.520]   The more as your family grows, the more of a pain it becomes to move.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.920]   You just have more stuff.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.440]   And, you know, moving to a different condo or house within the city is one thing, but
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.840]   moving to a different state and to a different city with a family is another thing.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.720]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.880]   The logistics of moving is going to be really, really painful.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.740]   I think I'd probably just try to sell like our furniture, our electronics and everything
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.120]   and just keep the valuables and ship it.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.280]   Right.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.440]   Or bring the packable valuables on the airplane.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.440]   Are you kidding me?
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.520]   Just two suitcases each is not enough.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:53.280]   Well, not for a family with two kids, but I think people hire moving companies and they
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.800]   use insurance, you know, to protect their belongings.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   People do it all the time.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.720]   It could be done, but it's not maybe not an enjoyable process.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.960]   It's definitely not enjoyable process.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.160]   And then we'd have to find a new home and so forth.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.840]   So I'm really happy that we're there.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   There's less of a need to move.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.160]   You know, we already had a plan of moving in 2022, but now maybe it's not 2022.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:30.320]   Maybe it's 2025 or 2030 so that both our kids are old enough so that they can listen to
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:36.800]   direction and not, you know, kill themselves wandering off and they're just more independent.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.080]   So that is very interesting.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.320]   This whole situation right now is up in the air.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.480]   But I like big city living.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.080]   One thing you got to realize about big city living is that if you don't need to go to
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:55.040]   a day job while you're in a big city, it is an incredible, incredible place because you
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.800]   can roam around much more freely Monday through Friday with not a lot of crowds.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.560]   And there's just so much entertainment options, food options, cultural options, scenic options.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.400]   I mean, there's a reason why there's millions of tourists who come to San Francisco every
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.040]   single year or they used to.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.280]   It's because it's an amazing city.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.280]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   It's scenic.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.120]   There's just a lot to do and there's a lot of history and so forth.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.600]   So if you don't have to have a day job, big city living is even better because it is that
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:31.960]   grind of work, that constant pressure to perform and to compete with your peers and so forth
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   that really just brings you down, beats you down.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   And it beat me down.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.000]   I admit I couldn't handle it after about 13 years.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I want to do something new.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.680]   So I do want everyone to just hold their horses and think strategically, whether it's opening
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.480]   up a business in a big city or buying real estate or starting your career.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.720]   That's not dead, folks.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.120]   In fact, I think it's better than ever.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.800]   Ironically, I would pay more to live in San Francisco, more to live in New York if it
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.480]   was less crowded.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.880]   Now obviously, if enough people leave, there's going to be a depression in asset prices,
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.920]   for example, real estate.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.960]   But it's funny because the people who stay and I know many people who stay are all looking
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:24.080]   to upgrade and are actually looking to buy clusters of real estate so that they can build
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   a little community.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.480]   And in the past, it wasn't so easy, but now it is becoming easier.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.640]   All right, folks, we're going to wrap it up because our little ones need our attention
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   and love.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.120]   Hopefully, you enjoyed this podcast.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   And if you think big city living is on the decline, let us know in the comments, in the
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.200]   post or just shoot us an email or a shout out on social media.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   And we'll see you around.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.320]   Thanks, everybody.
