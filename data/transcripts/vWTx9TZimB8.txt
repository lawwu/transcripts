[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Maybe we could just touch on some of the lifestyle factors
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.740]   that you just mentioned,
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.660]   'cause I do think it's important that people
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.620]   really start to feel into their sense of agency.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.820]   And here we're talking about things
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.500]   that are relatively low time investment,
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.860]   certainly don't have much financial cost
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.660]   in the sense that they could be done in gyms
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.360]   and with fancy equipment, but they don't require that.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.900]   Again, I wanna point out that these are not
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.620]   like strict prescriptives,
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.500]   but if you had a magic wand,
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.360]   and because you are interested in the health of humans,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.180]   let's talk about a few of these things
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.940]   that can improve glucose disposal
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.060]   and mitochondrial function,
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.500]   mitophagy, the removal of dead or dysfunctional mitochondria
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.260]   so they can be replaced.
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.900]   Let's talk about the walking one first.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.220]   You said 7,000 steps a day.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.020]   I don't track my steps.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.460]   What are we really talking about there?
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.680]   We're talking about taking the stairs
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.300]   and trying to walk as much as possible.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.820]   Maybe we were gonna just give
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.020]   a really crude prescription.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.580]   You're a doctor, so you can prescribe things.
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.180]   What would you tell people to do?
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.020]   How many short walks per day?
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.860]   Is it three?
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.540]   Is it five?
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.380]   What are we talking?
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.500]   - I would say, I mean, at least three.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.140]   I would say aiming for more than that is good though.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.260]   So to sort of just give a sense of the picture of walking,
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.620]   if walking were a pill,
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.400]   it would be the most impactful pill we've ever had
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.340]   in all of modern medicine.
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460]   There was a paper in JAMA,
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.460]   6,300 participants followed for 10 to 11 years.
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.860]   And the people who simply walked 7,000 steps per day
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.540]   compared to less than that had an up to 70% lower risk
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.580]   of all-cause mortality in the follow-up period.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.540]   So not causality, but it's pretty incredible.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.300]   They've done follow-up research
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.340]   with slightly different numbers showing,
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.500]   again though, like many thousands of people in the study
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.220]   followed for about 10 years,
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.300]   8,000 to 12,000 steps per day
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.180]   was associated with 50 to 65% lower all-cause mortality.
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.980]   And this has been played out in many studies
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.560]   showing about a 50% reduction in Alzheimer's,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.180]   dementia, obesity, type two diabetes,
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.480]   depression, cancer, gastric reflux,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.580]   just all across the board.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.300]   And I think the key thing is that it's not about the steps.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.980]   It's about the fact that muscle contraction is medicine.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.500]   When we contract our muscles,
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.860]   even in a very like low-grade way,
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.540]   like walking or doing a couple of air squats,
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.540]   we're activating AMPK and we are essentially causing
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.660]   that cell to have a stimulus to push glucose channels
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.860]   to the cell membrane.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.340]   Most of the time, the glucose channels are like in vesicles,
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.660]   in little bags inside the cells.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.540]   They're not on the cell membrane.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.540]   So of course that's gonna keep the glucose
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.380]   in your bloodstream not being processed by the mitochondria.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.380]   So when we think about steps,
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.100]   it's a proxy metric for just moving more throughout the day.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.580]   So let's take two people.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.780]   You have a person who's walking for one to two minutes
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.220]   every 30 minutes throughout the day.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.740]   Maybe they're exercising at the end of the day
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.300]   or the beginning of the day, maybe they're not.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.980]   That person is stimulating glucose channels
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.180]   to be at the membrane all day.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.020]   Now let's take another person
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.740]   who works out really hard for one hour
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.020]   in the beginning or the end of the day.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.940]   They feel great about it.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.260]   They've checked that off their box,
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.660]   but they're sitting the entire rest of the day.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.980]   Yes, they have gotten the benefits from the exercise,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.800]   but for a lot of that day,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.100]   those glucose channels are inside the cell,
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.140]   not doing the work they could be doing.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.420]   So I think about these little teeny short walking breaks
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.260]   or pushup breaks or air squat breaks
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.100]   every 30 minutes or so throughout the day
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.780]   as me essentially inside the cell
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.940]   pushing the glucose channels, the cell membrane
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.400]   to make them constitutively active.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.420]   It's totally different physiology and it's so easy.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.460]   So it's not about the steps.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.340]   It's about muscle contraction regularly throughout the day.
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.700]   And this has been shown out
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.140]   in actually more clinical research, which has taken,
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.820]   there's been several studies.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.100]   Two that I think are fascinating
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.900]   where they basically took two groups and they said,
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.980]   okay, we're gonna have you walk 20 minutes
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.380]   before each meal, three times a day,
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.140]   20 minutes after each meal.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.660]   So that's also three times a day
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.180]   or for like two minutes every 30 minutes throughout the day.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.260]   - So these are three separate groups.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.100]   - Three separate groups.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.420]   - Either 20 minutes before, either 20 minutes after or.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.460]   - Two to three minutes every 30 minutes.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.420]   All added up to 60 minutes of walking
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.060]   or light jogging a day.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.800]   I'm kind of paraphrasing two different studies
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.700]   that showed the same thing.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.060]   One was jogging, one was walking,
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.180]   but it was basically chunks versus short walks
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.820]   every 30 minutes throughout the waking day.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.100]   The groups that do the short movement
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.620]   regularly throughout the day,
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.820]   even though the total time is the same
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.780]   across all the groups, have significantly lower
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.020]   24-hour glucose level averages,
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.000]   24-hour insulin level averages.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.620]   They are metabolically healthier.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.380]   And I believe, and the research mechanistically has shown
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.940]   that it's because we're constitutively putting
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.240]   these channels of the membrane to take up the substrate,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.340]   use the substrate.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.780]   So this is not to replace exercise,
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.460]   but I think it's a reframe.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.820]   I think the concept of exercise is something
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.980]   we're really very wedded to in our Western culture.
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.620]   And you look at more like the Blue Zones
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.700]   and the Centenarians, and it's like they're kind of moving
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.900]   as built into their everyday life.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.340]   So we've taken movement out of our everyday life
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.380]   as these knowledge workers, as we've been industrialized.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.540]   And then we think that exercise replaces
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.800]   that all day movement, but biochemically it does not.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.340]   So I think a big part of kind of digging ourselves
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.940]   out of this chronic disease mess
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.000]   and creating capacity for mitochondria
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.360]   is finding ways to take a lot of the activities
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.140]   we do now seated and just find a way to do more of them
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.760]   moving, standing, or walking.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.160]   Or if that's tough, you really need to sit
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.860]   at your desk all day, then every 30 minutes,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.420]   taking two minutes to do some just light movement,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.540]   flex those muscles, get the glucose channels
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.380]   of the membrane, get the mitochondria active.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.180]   So, and I think another fascinating stat is like,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.140]   our gym memberships in the US have doubled
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.660]   since the year 2000, and obesity has gone up
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.600]   in the same period.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.820]   So there's some mismatch between our obsession
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.340]   with exercise and our actual outcomes that we're seeing.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.700]   And I think it's that we have not actually rebuilt
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.900]   constitutive movement into our daily lives.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.800]   - Very interesting, 'cause I think a lot of people
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.780]   are now working out, so to speak,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.860]   doing resistance training, which I think is terrific.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.700]   - Terrific, yeah.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.340]   - Used to be such, you know, so restricted
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.600]   to niche subculture stuff like bodybuilding,
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.580]   pre-season football, military, et cetera.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.980]   And now it's more ubiquitous for everybody,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.140]   men, women, young, old, that's terrific.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.820]   Same thing with things like yoga and cardiovascular training.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.700]   I mean, I like to study the history of exercise culture,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060]   and it wasn't, but in the '60s when, you know,
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.780]   jogging was considered kind of like, whoa,
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.980]   that's like a really esoteric niche culture thing.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.620]   So lots changed.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.020]   I love the prescriptives you gave,
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.820]   because it's just very straightforward.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.460]   A couple of short walks, it just makes so much sense.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.580]   And I love the visual, and I hope people
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.020]   will really hold it in mind.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.720]   So I'll reiterate it, the translocation
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.640]   of these energy utilization stores, vesicles,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.520]   as you call them, these little packets
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.920]   from the center of the cell out to the cell surface,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.480]   where then they can be involved, excuse me,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.360]   in metabolic processes and the utilization of energy
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.880]   in ways that otherwise they wouldn't.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.360]   And glucose disposal being a big part of this.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.020]   So I have heard that a short walk after a meal
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.240]   will reduce blood glucose in a way that's really dramatic.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.620]   - Huge amount, 30, 35%, just taking a walk
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.880]   around the block after a meal.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.920]   That's definitely a prescription I think everyone should do,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.760]   'cause the research is so strong on it,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.440]   is that building in simply a 10-minute walk
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.660]   around the block or a dance party in the kitchen,
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.920]   moving your muscles for 10 minutes after a meal
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.020]   can drastically reduce your glucose response,
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.320]   'cause you're just bringing all those channels
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.640]   to the membrane, you're taking up the glucose,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.460]   you're using it, it's a whole different physiology
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.240]   than sitting on the couch after a meal.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.320]   That's very high impact, it's high leverage
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.480]   if it's after a meal, so highly recommend that.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.960]   And the levels data and clinical data
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.000]   has shown that out time and time again.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.520]   - Whenever I go to a city like New York,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.760]   when I am forced to walk more,
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.640]   I always just feel so much better.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.200]   We also know that the optic flow
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.840]   that one experiences with walking
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.020]   has some interesting effects on the limbic pathways
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.180]   and quieting of some of the anxiety
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.260]   and stress-related pathways.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.040]   This links up with things like EMDR,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.780]   although there are factors that are separate from EMDR.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.700]   Basically moving through space, not outer space,
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.480]   but walking through space with optic flow
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.000]   has a certain anxiety reduction function in the brain,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.320]   which they're beautiful data there, in my opinion.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.600]   Okay, so that touches on walking.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.000]   You did mention higher intensity exercise.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.720]   So let's keep it within the cardiovascular realm for now.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.660]   So getting heart rate way, way up,
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.660]   getting breathing hard for some minutes each week,
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.400]   maybe a couple of times per week.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.100]   It seems that's a good way to increase
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.520]   mitochondrial function and mitochondrial number.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.800]   Is that right?
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.700]   - Yeah, so you take sort of each type of exercise.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.380]   We've got walking, we've got resistance training,
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.640]   we've got high intensity interval training,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   we've got endurance training,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.880]   and then we've got sort of more like zone two.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.240]   So we've got these different flavors
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.520]   of how we get our heart rate up,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.000]   how we get the blood flowing, what we signal to the cells.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.960]   And each one actually has like a slightly different impact
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.920]   on the mitochondria.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.640]   When we think about biogenesis,
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.160]   we're thinking mostly like endurance exercise
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.680]   and really more of that zone two.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.980]   And like that is really gonna be a stimulus inside the cell
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.280]   to print more mitochondria.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.640]   When we think about improving mitochondrial fusion,
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.040]   high intensity interval training
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.680]   is really, really good for that.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.400]   When we think about resistance training,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.160]   it's like that's like muscle hypertrophy.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.480]   We're gonna be creating more muscle cells
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.920]   and we need more mitochondria for those.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   So each one has kind of a different impact.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.160]   And I think this is where honestly,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.420]   I think the regular guidelines that we have
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.200]   even by our government actually make a lot of sense.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.400]   It's like work every major muscle group three times a week
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.020]   in a resistance type training,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.920]   and then work to get 75 to 150 minutes
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.160]   of moderate to strenuous activity.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.720]   So 75 minutes of strenuous activity
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.300]   or 150 minutes per week of moderate activity.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.140]   So that actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.320]   80% of Americans are not meeting
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.280]   those very basic guidelines.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.980]   And 20% of Americans don't get any physical activity
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.820]   really at all.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.360]   Activity for the average American
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.400]   is 3,000 to 4,000 steps per day,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.040]   which is less than two miles.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.260]   So we are not even close to even meeting
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.800]   the basic recommendations that are out there.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.000]   But I think those are pretty reasonable.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.400]   Resistance training two to three times a week,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   most major muscle groups and working to get the heart rate
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.460]   up moderate level for 150 minutes a week
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.820]   or strenuous for 75 minutes a week.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.780]   Those are going together to be potent stimuli
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.200]   for biogenesis, mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.460]   for increasing antioxidant enzymes
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.540]   that are gonna protect the mitochondria
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.120]   from that oxidative stress.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.060]   And the one that's just actually not in there
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.380]   in sort of the basic recommendations for Americans
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.200]   is the walking.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.060]   I would just absolutely add to that
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.500]   at least 7,000 steps per day
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.800]   based on what the data is showing,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.600]   which honestly would probably take less than an hour total
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.700]   to do if you break it up throughout the day,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.600]   it's just a few minutes a day.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.200]   So that right there are gonna be like a big multifaceted
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.000]   set of signals for increasing mitochondrial capacity
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.340]   in different ways.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.180]   - Thank you for tuning in
