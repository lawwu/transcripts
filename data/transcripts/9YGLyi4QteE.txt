[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700]   -Man, welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.180]   I'm here with my guy, Bones.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.180]   -My guy, MPD.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.320]   -Appreciate you on the podcast, my boy.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   -Yo.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.960]   -Man, so I remember when you got drafted, you came in the locker room, said, "What's
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.960]   up there, everybody?"
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   And, like, we clicked.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.240]   I think I really appreciated, like, your authenticity, and I noticed that just from the jump when
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   we first met.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.240]   -Yeah.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.840]   -And then you just proved it over and over, like, no matter what's going on, you're always
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.840]   gonna be Bones.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840]   -Mm-hmm.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.400]   -When you're in the game, it don't matter who's in the game, you're gonna be Bones.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   -Mm-hmm.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.240]   -And I just feel like we clicked, so I appreciate you hopping on the podcast, my brother.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   -Yeah, for sure.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.040]   You know, definitely, being drafted by the Nuggets, it was definitely huge for me.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.920]   You know, it was a blessing, you know, just overcoming what I overcame.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920]   -Yeah.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.920]   -You know, in my life.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.920]   -Yeah.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.880]   -And then being drafted, 26th pick, you know, by the Nuggets, it was big for me, man.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   It was everything.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.560]   I didn't really know what to expect, you know, coming to Denver.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.080]   I thought it was really cold, but I got on the plane, and it seemed like the sun was
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   out.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   I'm like, "Damn, this is different."
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   -Yeah.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080]   -It seemed like it's hot out.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   -Yeah.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.560]   -But, you know, the first time I came to the, you know, the arena, I think the first person
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.400]   I saw was you when I walked into the -- -It was the pool room, by the way.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.400]   -Yeah, the pool room.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   And I'm like, "What's up, MP?"
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.080]   But we definitely just clicked from there.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.520]   You know, Genuine Vibes and Genuine Souls always, you know, connect with Genuine Souls,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680]   and ever since then, it's just been like a lock, for sure.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   -For sure.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.600]   I remember, bro, like, I realized you were a killer, and, like, it was your rookie season,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   right?
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   -Mm-hmm.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.000]   -And I think we were in training camp in San Diego, and I'll never forget this.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   -Oh, yeah.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.040]   -I think I came down and, like, hit, like, a heasy pull-up, and I think you were on the
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   side, like, waiting for me to pass it.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.360]   -And you was like, "I hit the shot," but you were like, "Mike, like, I can do that, too.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   You can pass the ball."
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.720]   So, okay, like, he's cold, like, and this is your rookie season, like, and you just
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   were so confident, bro.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   -Yeah.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.440]   -And so it was, like, it was a joy to watch you play and, like, be your teammate, you
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   know?
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.480]   And then, so, I think I kind of was hurt during the time when you -- when they were talking
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.480]   about the trade rumors and when you -- That's cool?
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   That's his phone?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.120]   Yeah, I think I was hurt during the time the trade rumors came around, so I really didn't
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   know what happened.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   -Exactly.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.720]   -But, man, now you end up going to L.A., and I've been tuned in, obviously, but how has
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.040]   everything been for you over there?
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   You enjoying it?
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   -Yeah, yeah, it's been lovely, man.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.960]   It's been dope, obviously, coming from, you know, Denver, a situation where, you know,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.320]   I thrived in, you know, I was having fun playing over there, stuff like that, but I just felt
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.840]   like it was just, you know, needed a change for me, needed different scenery, and, you
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.160]   know, obviously, over here in L.A., it's -- I think it's a, you know, a beautiful thing
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   for me.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.720]   You know, I'm learning under, you know, four future Hall of Famers, you know, just staying
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   ready, staying patient.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.240]   You know, obviously, you know, last year, I came around February time.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.140]   You know, it was kind of hard just to learn, you know.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.760]   It wasn't hard learning the plays or learning, you know -- I mean, obviously, you're a hooper,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.520]   you know you're going to fit in with whatever, but just having to move from, you know, one
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.280]   state to another, one team to another, you know, having to learn the new staff, new players,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.720]   everybody names, the play calls, it's tough, you know, and obviously, on top of that, you're
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.640]   still trying to perform and, you know, still trying to, you know, earn that roster spot
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   as well, too, coming in from another team, but I feel like I did that, and obviously,
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.280]   this year, you know, just playing well off the bat, and then, you know, a trade happened,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.120]   and, you know, you just get bumped down and out of the rotation, but I feel like it's,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.040]   you know, even though it may not look like it's a, you know, a good thing for me, I still
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.760]   look at it as a good thing, because I'm still learning under for future Hall of Famers,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360]   and I know my time will come, so I'm really not, you know, too down on it.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.120]   Obviously, I want to play, but I ain't too down, though.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.640]   >> Yeah, no, you always smiling.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.320]   You always have had a good attitude about everything, even, you know, when things -- like
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.360]   in Denver, you know, you know how the NBA is.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.520]   Even in Denver, when things weren't going good, you always maintained a smile, and so
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.720]   I've been checking up on you even in L.A. just because even times last year, you weren't
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.000]   playing as much as you were supposed to or whatever, and now, but you have always just
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.920]   maintained, like, the attitude, the good attitude, and you're young, bro.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.240]   You're going to end up doing your thing, but that leads me to a question, like, you played
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.400]   so well, you know, obviously, in the offseason, you'd be killing every run, you know, and
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.440]   you just go, and, you know, you're like the highlight of the summer.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.720]   Everybody be looking at the bones pilings, the pro-am videos or whatever.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.260]   How do you maintain, like, is the NBA, for people that don't know the NBA, is it as fun
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260]   as the summer?
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.040]   Like, is basketball as fun to you in the NBA when you're playing or not?
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.680]   Like, is it as fun as when you're doing your thing in the summertime?
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   >> Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.680]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   I would say it's kind of different, you know, but at the same time, I feel like if I had,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.680]   you know, the keys or if I had to, you know, just go out there and just be yourself and,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.520]   you know, with no leash on you, no minute thing going on, I feel like it'd be the same
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.000]   thing that's going on in the summertime, but the summertime, you're just playing, you're
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   just playing.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.800]   I feel like everybody's so in tune with me, you know, they love seeing me play and just
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.680]   be free, and, you know, they'd be like, "Man, if he just had, you know, the leash off of
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   him, if he just go, he'd be..."
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   >> Everybody knows.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.200]   >> Yeah, everybody know, you know, but, you know, at the same time, I'm just waiting my
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   turn, waiting patiently, but, man, I ain't lying, the summertime, you know, it'd be so
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.320]   fun because I could just really just go out there and just be me, you know, even though
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.000]   I'd be me in the league, too, but it's more in spurt, like, it's like the whole time,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   the whole game, I'm just wilding.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   >> Going in somebody's head.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> I'm just wilding.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   >> Did you always, like, okay, so, obviously, nowadays, a lot of people grow up with trainers
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.560]   and they grow up with, you know, they go through drills.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.640]   Your game is so unique because the way you grew up, where you grew up hooping, you know,
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.400]   on the park, how did that, because most, like, hoopers that grow up that way don't make it
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   to the NBA.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   >> Facts.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.520]   >> They don't know how to fit into structure and all that.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   How did you kind of grow up and how did your game, like, how is it the way it is because
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.680]   the way you handle the ball is so unique, the way you, you know, the show time, the
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   flashiness.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   >> Facts.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.240]   >> Like, is that just the way you grew up or how did you grow up hooping?
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.080]   >> Yeah, that's definitely the way I grew up.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.040]   I grew up on a lot of park basketball, a lot of recreational basketball, recreation basketball,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   however you say it.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.520]   But, you know, I grew up on a lot of that.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.200]   Honestly, just playing, going to gyms, you know, playing one-on-one, two-on-two, three-on-threes,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.480]   you know, literally all day, like, sun up, sun down, you know, because at first, like,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.840]   it was kind of hard to get on the court, you know, because they're like, you got to wait
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.800]   your turn, you know, you're younger, you know, and I'm just on the sideline just practicing
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.480]   my moves, you know, I'm just shooting the ball in the air and stuff like that, but just
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   watching just live basketball, you know, I've been taking so many notes and stuff, just
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.280]   young, and I knew, like, once I get on the court, I knew I'd be ready, but, man, just
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.720]   how it just translated to the NBA, just honestly in the gym and just working, you know, try
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.760]   to, like, simplify some things, you know, you know, obviously, it's sometimes you can
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   be a little flashy.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.840]   You can show your flashes of, you know, being fancy here and there on a fast break, you
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.720]   can throw a dime, you can turn around, you know, just get the crowd into it.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.000]   That's how I've always been, you know, I never wanted to, like, change that or, you know,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   let somebody change that part of me because I'm a very, you know, entertaining player.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.000]   A lot of people like seeing me play, they love watching me, so it's like, I never just
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.920]   changed that because, oh, this doesn't fit the criteria of, you know, a coach like this
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.800]   or, you know, somebody don't like the way I play, da-da-da, nah, that's never been me
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.960]   because at the end of the day, it's like, I'm not going to change who I am, you know,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   this is what got me here.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.040]   I'm not just going to change who I am now, you know, just because I made it to the league,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.240]   now I'm going to forever be me, so, you know, that's definitely how I grew up, though, you
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   know, a lot of park basketball.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   >> Yeah, nah.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.840]   Like I said, bro, that's one thing I admire, like, can't nobody tell you, like, your confidence
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.160]   and just the swag you play with, can't nobody tell you you're not the coldest.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.000]   For people that don't know, like, me and Bones would have shooting contests after every shoot
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   around.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   >> I'm crying.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.520]   >> Every shoot around, we would do our little shooting contest, me and him, sometimes other
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.560]   people would join, but they never would win, but I could say Bones is one of the only people,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.880]   like, I've shot against is you, Steph, and, like, maybe one other person.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   Probably Trey.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.640]   >> Trey, Trey, but, like, that can consistently beat me.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.720]   Like, he would beat me most days, I would be so hot, but, like, as flashy as your game
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.760]   is, like, it's still very, very polished.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.280]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.440]   >> Who did you grow up, like, who did you grow up idolizing, who'd you try to model
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   your game after?
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   >> You know, that's such a tough question, 'cause I really never try to, like, modelize
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.000]   my game after nobody, but I love watching Hoop, though, you know?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.720]   But, like, I love taking, like, flat, like, game, like, or my moves from different players
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.920]   and stuff like that, but I never went like, oh, yeah, I just want to be just like him,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.400]   like, this is my, you know, my idol, da-da-da, you know?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.920]   That never been me, but a guy who, like, I always watch was Hot Sauce.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.080]   Hot Sauce was always a guy, you know, I just watch, and that's somebody, like, I come home
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   from school, you know, I eat a bowl of cereal, you know, I turn him on, on the phone, I pop
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   the phone up, and after I finish eating my cereal, I grab the basketball and go in the
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.400]   mirror, and I just practice all his moves and stuff with this big shirt on, you know,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   the big shirts he used to wear.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   >> He was cold.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   He was cold, though.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   >> That's, he was cold.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.320]   >> So that makes sense, then, why you Hoop the way you do.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.800]   >> I used to always just watch him, bro, and I used to go to the gym and try to practice
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.840]   his moves, and they was working, but, like, I didn't want to be too much, like, you know,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   doing way too much.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.040]   Yeah, you know, but I still, like, try to, like, try to amplify some of that in my game,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.440]   and that gave me, like, my flair, like, my swag, you know, like, you know, it gave me
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.920]   that, nah, I can't nobody, like, fuck me on the court type shit, you know, that gave me
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   that vibe, though.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.800]   >> It's a video that went viral, a YouTube video, I just seen it, like, like, I didn't
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.400]   even know about it until I started playing with you, but it's a viral video of you playing
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   one-on-one.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.960]   They was some bums, but you was going at dudes, and I think you were younger, and they was
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   getting hot.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.400]   >> Like, it's, yeah, y'all can look it up, Bones Island one-on-one.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   >> I definitely know it's one you talking about, for sure.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.960]   I just was watching it the other day.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.760]   >> But, like, how old were you during that?
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.120]   Like, was that, like, a normal thing for you to just go to the park and be playing one-on-one
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.200]   with dudes, and the cameras be out and all that?
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.520]   >> Yeah, so, like, it's a, it's a big backstory to that, so, you know, for that, for everybody
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.000]   who don't know, this was a video that went viral.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.200]   I was about 17 years old, but it's a league called Czech Rock League.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   >> It's a league that I played in growing up.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.480]   A lot of, you know, kids went from Wilmington Delaware, even, you know, Philadelphia area,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   you know, Tri-State area.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.120]   A lot of people come down and play in the league, and, you know, it was one game that's
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.200]   going on, and we were waiting until it was done, and it was, like, me, it was, like,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.360]   six other people, and it was the two, the two owners that, you know, made the Czech
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   Rock League up, you know.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.840]   >> And, you know, we just conversating about basketball, you know, then they got to the
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.440]   comparison game, and I'm, like, I'm staying out of it.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   I ain't saying nothing.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   I ain't saying nothing.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   I'm staying out of it.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.640]   You know, but then I got brought up, and I'm, like, nah, that's, like, hey, nah, y'all
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   tripping.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.600]   I'm not comparing to nobody, and they just kept saying, yeah, you know, I can beat him
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   one-on-one.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.200]   You know, I can beat, you know, Bones one-on-one, and da-da-da, and I'm, like, you tripping.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   It's a court right here.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.320]   Like, we can go check out right now.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.320]   >> It's a court literally right here.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.560]   We walked on the court, and the first guy, you know, I just feel like, you know, I don't
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   know.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   I think I feel like his pride got in the way.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   >> It did.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   It did.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   >> He got in the way.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   >> He was playing way.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   Bro.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.440]   >> His pride got in the way too much, but the second guy, who was 7-0, like, his pride was
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   way higher, though.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.680]   Like, he knew, like, he just let the, you know, the people where he was from, you know,
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.320]   he's from Philadelphia, but he let the people, like, get in his ear, yeah, go out there and,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   you know, play and stuff.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   >> And they was trying to play mad hard.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   They was trying to fight.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   >> Mad hard.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.720]   And I'm like, you know, this is not going to end how you want it to end.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   I'm just like, nah.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.280]   And I didn't even know that, like, this was going to be a viral video, though, bro.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.880]   I was just going up there, just being myself, all the people around that was watching, everybody
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880]   just being there.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.320]   So, we didn't know that the guy who recorded the video, we didn't know he was going to
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.880]   drop it or he was actually recording, you know?
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.840]   But it got so much attention and stuff.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   I'm like, nah, he definitely going to drop this.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   >> Nah.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   >> And ever since then, that joint just blew up, bro.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   >> That video is ODI.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.360]   >> But, you know, what's crazy, though, bro, a lot of people, like, they like, oh, that's
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.640]   the guy from the video that went viral.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.800]   Like, they look at me now, like, wow, that's the guy from the video, he made it to the
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   league.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   >> That's how viral that video went?
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   >> Yes, bro.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   Like, to this day, like, that's the guy from the video that went viral.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.400]   I'm like, damn, they remember that video?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   That's crazy, bro.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.720]   Nah, it's a hilarious video, bro, because it's just like you now, like, the way you're
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   talking crazy to do it.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   And they were so hot.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   >> Oh, my God.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   >> They were so mad, bro.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   >> They definitely was, yeah.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:25.440]   >> But, nah, nah, back to the league, like, I was watching a podcast, I think it was Emmanuel
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.120]   Moutier on someone's podcast, and he was just talking about he lost his love for the game.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.240]   And, like, you've always been, like, you can see in that video, you can see even the way
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.640]   you hoop now, your love for the game.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.680]   He was talking about he lost his love for the game because of how political the league
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   is.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.480]   He was like, I would be killing somebody in practice every day, but the coach tells me
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.640]   I'm not gonna play right now.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.480]   And, like, obviously, we've talked about Tyloo, Tyloo's from Missouri, like, that's my guy.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.760]   >> And, like, he's from 30 minutes down the street from where I'm from, and he's the most
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   chillest dude ever.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   >> Yeah, he is chill, for sure.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.360]   >> But do you feel like, not just in your situation, but now that you've been in the
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.400]   NBA, how political do you feel like it is?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.160]   Like, is it dudes to you, like, every day could be killing in practice that literally
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   don't play in the game?
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.440]   Or do you think the best players always play?
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.560]   >> Yeah, it's definitely a political game, but it's something that you just can't control,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   bro.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   >> Right.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   >> And, like, I can be killing every day in practice, you know, but it's just, like, it's
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.080]   just gonna go how it go, because maybe somebody's been there, you know, years, or maybe they're
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.360]   on a contract that's way bigger than yours, and it's just gonna go the way it goes.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.000]   But, I mean, it's something that you really just can't control.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Maybe he got a couple years over you, and you just getting in the league, or you're
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.920]   just your second year, but you're killing, though.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.760]   But he on a crazy contract, you know, but he playing over you, playing, you know, mad
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   minutes.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.720]   But it's something that you, excuse me, it's really something that you just can't control,
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   bro.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   >> Right.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.200]   >> And it's tough, you know, because it's like, man, I wish I was playing a little bit
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   more, you know.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.260]   You know, I feel like I deserve to play a little bit more, you know, I'm already killing
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.320]   it with the minutes that I'm getting, why can't I get a little bit, like, ten more,
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   you know.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   >> Like, I feel like I deserve it, you know.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.400]   But, man, it's definitely a political game, but it's just something that you just can't
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   get caught up in, man.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.800]   You just gotta stay, like, level-headed, you know, just stay out of that, man.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.720]   >> And you never let that affect, like, your joy?
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   >> You don't let it affect your joy?
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   >> No, not at all.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   You know me, bro.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.160]   Like, I ain't gonna let nothing shake me, bro.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.320]   It's just, like, but at the same time, it just be kind of tough, though, it do, because,
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.600]   like, you know, you just want to play, bro, and that's me, like, I just want to hoot,
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   you know.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.800]   So, it's like, ah, this political game could definitely get tough, but, man, it's something
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.480]   you just really can't control, bro.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.600]   It's really something you can't, facts.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   >> Nah, 100%.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.800]   Nah, you, I mean, you know, like, you a star, everybody knows, I think I was watching PG's
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.240]   podcast and he was talking about the way you play, how you are as a star, and you got,
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.560]   like you said, y'all got four Hall of Famers right now, like.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   >> Yeah, bro.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.440]   >> So, y'all still figuring it out, but whether it's there or somewhere else, like, you gonna
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   blossom.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   So, it's never any stress in that area.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:56.040]   I want to turn to, like, your faith, because you do have an unshakable joy, which is something
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.440]   I've always appreciated about you.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   >> Yeah.

[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   lifted if something was wrong.

[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.600]   through so much, but, you know, Jesus has never, you know, forsaken me at all, like,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.800]   he always been there for me, like, regardless, like, how, you know, impossible something
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.400]   may seem, how, like, un-extraordinary something may seem, it's, like, he's just always there
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.920]   for me, and it's, like, I could never, like, you know, turn on him, no matter if, like,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.440]   things get, you know, worse for me, or maybe I don't like how something's going, you know,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.400]   or maybe some life problems that I'm going through, I just know, like, I'm always be,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.640]   you know, straight, because I got, you know, God on my side, and it's never gonna make
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.920]   me, like, turn away from, you know, him, because something not going my way, you know, I feel
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.240]   like a lot of people nowadays, like, they quick to, like, you know, why me, or, you
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.360]   know, why am I going through this, you know, but not even knowing, like, maybe this can,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.840]   you know, help you, you know, on your path going forward, and that's something--
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840]   - Diversity can, like, shape you.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.160]   - Yeah, exactly, you know, and I feel like that's what something I'm going through right
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.920]   now, like, this right now, it's shaping me right now, you know, it's building resilience
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.160]   in me, you know, it's building patience in me, you know, and it's building, like, just
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.880]   even more high character, you know, so it's something that I definitely, you know, appreciate
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.000]   right now, even though I wanna play, but at the same time, I know God is, you know, strengthening
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.960]   me, you know, getting stronger off the floor, you know, and stuff like that, so it's, I
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.680]   feel like it's really, it has helped me, but I think definitely never shake, though, at
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   all.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   - Never, nah.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.360]   You, we were talking about this before the podcast started, just about how, like, the
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.760]   fans, even in Denver, how people can be so for you, in life in general, any NBA player
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.160]   deals with this, that people can be so for you, but as soon as you do one thing they
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.880]   don't like, or they perceive something that's not even how it was, they turn on you, and
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.160]   I think we've talked about it a little bit, even the Denver fans, 'cause you were a fan
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.680]   favorite, like, every time you hop on the floor, you're going crazy, and just the fact
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.560]   that, you know, you receive backlash for any negativity, I asked AG this in my podcast
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.640]   the other day, how do you deal with, like, the positivity and negativity, 'cause, like,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.840]   there's been so much positivity surrounding you, but then, like, one thing goes wrong
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.560]   and now there's some negativity, do you, how do you deal with all that?
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.280]   - So, honestly, man, I just be taking it like, alright, they just showing love because I'm
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.880]   killing, you know, or they, you know, at this moment they showing me love, but I don't let
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.720]   it, like, get too, you know, head over heels, or like, ah, I'm so in, you know, with the,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.560]   you know, how they treating me and stuff like that, like, obviously I love it, but you,
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.080]   it always, like, you know, something go wrong, they just gonna turn on you, it's just like,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.520]   it's just what happens, bro, it happens to literally, like, you know, Hall of Famers
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.080]   who played and stuff like that, the best players, bro, so it's like, of course it can happen
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.880]   to me, so I don't be too, like, locked in on it, of course, like, I appreciate, you
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.840]   know, fan bases that, you know, take me in and, like, really cheer me on, they appreciate
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.880]   my game, they appreciate how fun I have on the floor, you know, speaking of Denver fans,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.000]   you know, when I was over there, you know, I checked in and they, they were, like, rowdy
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.480]   every time, like, they love watching me play, but, obviously, the trade went down, it happened,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.200]   now it's everybody just, like, hating me, like, you know, but, I, I feel like they don't
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.760]   really, I feel like they don't really hate me, they still got love for me, but it's just
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.920]   the fact that I'm just not there anymore is making them kinda like, damn, like, we just
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.880]   gonna go at it, we just gonna keep, you know, going at it, even stuff like that, but I still
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.080]   got love for Denver, bro, like, it took me in with open arms, like, I never just say,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.960]   like, F Denver, like, that's, that's never, you know, me, that, that won't ever come out
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.160]   my mouth, they took me in with open arms, every time I checked on the floor, I had fun,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.920]   you know, so, yeah, I don't know, it's, it's something that, like, you just gotta, you
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.400]   just gotta just hoop, bro, you can't really get into the whole fan thing and all that,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.560]   you know, you just can't get into that, bro.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   Facts.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.480]   You talked before, you was, like, talking about what has shaped you into this person
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   is the things you've gone through, I remember, yeah, back in San Diego, when we was just
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.200]   chopping it up on the training table, I'll never forget this conversation, like, I don't
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.800]   know how it came up, but you talked about what you went through, and you was telling
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:12.120]   me, like, this is what, this is why I am, this is how I am, this is why I smile so much,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   can you talk a little bit to people, because I think, like, more than just a basketball
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.000]   player, like, you inspire so many people, because, and people don't even know your story
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.640]   like that, but I do, and I, and to see you smile through that, to see the way you take
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.040]   care of your, your mom and your, your nephew, like, people don't even know where all that
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.440]   comes from, can you a little bit talk about, you know, the incident through high school?
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.400]   Yeah, facts, so, back in 2018, you know, I had, I had went through a house fire tragedy,
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:45.040]   you know what happened, and, you know, I was watching March Madness, and, in my room, and
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.560]   I was on the phone with one of my friends, and, you know, I'm just literally just chilling,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.440]   just laying back, and it's like a, I forget what day it was, you know, it was like a Saturday
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.560]   or not, I forget which one of those days it was, but, you know, I'm just, just chilling
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.360]   back, and it's one of those days where everybody just be, you know, chilling in the crib, like,
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.480]   nobody bothering each other, you know, everybody just resting and stuff like that, and, you
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.320]   know, I'm watching the game and stuff, and, just chilling, and, and I just, just get up
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.960]   out my, get up out my bed, because I start smelling, like, you know, smoke just surrounding
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.200]   just, like, my, like, just outside, like, and I'm, like, damn, like, what's that smell,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.720]   but, you know, like, that type of smell is normal for, you know, where I grew up, you
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.800]   know, in the hood, it's normal, people think it's a barbecue, you know, or it's a cookout
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.480]   going on, so I'm, like, yeah, it's normal, so I just sat back in my bed, and, it started
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.080]   getting more intense, intense, intense, I'm, like, damn, what's that smell, like, that's
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.680]   not, like, a barbecue, it smells like something burning, like, something on fire, so, you
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.560]   know, I get out of my bed, and I had, you know, went to my door, and I hope, I had opened
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.760]   my door, and I just see all these flames just bursting, and I'm, like, oh, shit, what the
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.160]   hell going on, so I instantly had to close the door, and I had, went to my room, and
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   I had to just sit there, and just, like, think, like, damn, what the fuck am I supposed to
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   do, and mind you, what's already clicking in my head is my grandma, and my two baby
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.940]   cousins is in the other room, and I'm, like, damn, like, how can I get over there to the
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.360]   room, and see, you know, try to save them, or, you know, see what I can do, what plan
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.920]   I can do, but, you know, in movies, you can just think so, you know, they got all this
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.240]   time to think, you know, they, they go from one scene, you know, of the fire, or something,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.720]   and I'm trying to, you know, escape that, and they go to another scene, and they come
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   back to the fire, and it don't work like that, you know, that was something that, like, man,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.920]   I really had to, like, think fast, you know, with such little time, and, you know, I'm
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.840]   just sitting down, I'm trying to, I'm trying to really figure out how I'm going to do this,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.000]   but I live in an old house, so I'm, like, the windows ain't going to open, like, them,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.360]   them windows never open, so I'm, like, yeah, this, it might be over with for me, so I went
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.040]   to one of the windows to try to open, but, like, it didn't open, and now, the, the smoke
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.740]   and everything is really getting, like, inside the room, flames is starting to come in, the
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.480]   walls is getting hot, as I'm touching the windows, it's a little hot, so I'm, like,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.760]   ah, like, you know, I touched the first window, it didn't open, now I'm really, like, cloudy,
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.400]   I can't really see, you know, and now I'm trying to touch the second one, it's hot,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.080]   I'm trying to open it, I'm, like, nah, I'm just going to go, like, it's really not opening
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.200]   for me, I dropped to my knees, I'm, like, God, like, I really don't understand why this
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.400]   is happening to me, like, I feel, like, I did everything I was, you know, supposed to
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.520]   do, I feel, like, I'm a great person to people, you know, I always, you know, give, you know,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.560]   I never really, you know, I don't ask to receive from anybody, you know, I always want to do
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.920]   my deeds, you know, in your, in your honor, so I'll just be, like, dang, man, this is,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.800]   you know, crazy to happen to me, and, you know, as I'm just sitting down, I'm just praying,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.880]   I'm, like, man, if it's my time to go, I'm just going to go, you know, but I just hear
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.960]   that voice in my head, like, get up, like, I got you, get up, and it's, like, it's not
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.200]   your time to go yet, and he's, like, you know, that window is going to open to you, the third
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.000]   one, so I'm, like, it's no way, bro, it's no way, so I get up, I get up, I go to the
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.120]   window, and I just try to just open it, and it's open, I'm, like, wow, this is crazy,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.480]   so I open up, I see somebody outside, I'm, like, my house is on fire, my house is on
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.680]   fire, come save me, he's, like, you got to jump, you got to jump, I'm, like, I can't
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.840]   jump, it's too high, it's a three-story-floor house, I'm, like, I cannot jump, you got to
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.640]   jump, we need you, you're our last hope, when I heard that, I'm, like, damn, bro, like,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.280]   I really am the last hope from Wilmington, Delaware, it's so small, everybody depending
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.080]   on me to make it and stuff like that, so I'm, just, like, all right, fuck it, but I, after
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.800]   he said that, though, lie to you not, I went back in the room, got on, you know, on my
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.320]   knees, I'm, like, man, I'm just going to go, I can't jump, it's too high, just hear a voice
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.520]   in my head, God, just get up, just get up, just get up, I just said, fuck it, went out
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.040]   the window, I just jumped head first, I had to turn my patella tenon, I hit my knees on
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.720]   the bricks, I tried to get up and crawl, I couldn't walk, I tried to call to the car,
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.800]   you know, to the lady who had a phone, I'm, like, call my mom, call my mom, my mom was
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.840]   at a place called Main Event, and, you know, she was there with, like, a couple of my other
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.400]   family members, cousins and stuff, just having, like, a fun day, I forgot my mom's phone number,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.080]   so I'm, like, I don't know what's going on, my head's spinning, you know, I can't walk,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.000]   I can't do anything, you know, so I'm, like, damn, I forgot my mom's phone number, anybody
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.400]   know my mom's number, it just clicked in my head, I called my mom, you know, the number
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.120]   literally just clicked in my head, it was so crazy, I called my mom, the house on fire,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.880]   she drove so fast back to the crib, I just seen my mom just come, what's going on, house
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.560]   on fire, da, da, da, my mom in there with the baby, with the baby cousin, stuff like
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.480]   that, you know, her nephews, and that shit was just so crazy, bro, and then their mom,
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.160]   she came from McDonald's, 'cause they had got food for them, and she came from McDonald's,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.960]   she seen the house on fire, she dropped the McDonald's to the floor, I just seen her try
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.200]   to run in there to try to save her mom, or her sons, it's, like, damn, that shit is crazy,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.800]   then once it all, like, probably 10 minutes go past, I had seen my grandmother and my
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.920]   baby brother walk out, not walk out, but get carried out in the ambulance thing, I mean,
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.560]   the little walker thing, the stretcher thing, I just seen, you know, just all of them just
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.600]   covered up in just charcoal, I'm like, damn, like, this is, like, crazy, but it was such
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.120]   just a, like, a tough thing for me, man, even to this day, like, it's really been, like,
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   hard, you know, sometimes I can't speak about it, sometimes I can't, some, every time I
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.520]   speak about it, it's so hard, like, it just still be, like, flashbacks in the back of
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.640]   my head, it's so hard to get my words out, you know, it be tough, man, but, you know,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.340]   I never, like, like, just to this day, like, that's why I'm so big on, you know, speaking
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.760]   on, you know, God and, you know, having that faith in God, 'cause that, like, I'm really
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.840]   not supposed to be here, so, you know, I know, you know, my calling is, you know, bringing
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.640]   people back home to Jesus and believing in Him and believing that, you know, whatever
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.280]   you're going through, you know, it's always a brighter side, He always can pull you through,
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.800]   so that's something that, you know, I know it's my calling, but I do that through basketball.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   Bro, like, every time I hear that story, like, it just, it touches my heart, not just because
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   of what you've been through, but how you turn that around, bro, like, I don't know too many
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.760]   people that would take that and turn it around into what you've turned it around to and become
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.800]   the person through it that you've become, and, like, just giving people back at the
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:50.520]   crib, like, just hope and people just how bold you are about your faith, like, I forget
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.200]   what game it was, and you had the whole hood there, bro, like, and they was all behind
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   you, bro, it's like 50, how many people was in the crowd?
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   Bro, I was all whooped in there.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   Bro, and I was like, the fact that this dude, like, overcame what he came, I just, bro,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   that's...
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   Five fighters was there, too.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   That story is, like, man, people, that's like a story from a movie, like, is it, is that,
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   like, part of the reason you and just your mom and your nephews are so close?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:24.400]   Yeah, bro, like, we just all best friends, bro, we, like, closer than close, bro, like,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   I really...
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.560]   My mom is my best friend, bro, but, like, you know, people see me with my little nephew,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.760]   you know, I call him my baby brother, he's really my cousin, but I call him my nephew,
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.880]   my baby brother, like, he's just everything and one, bro, but I really call him my angel
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.680]   on earth because he survived the house fire.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   He has the burn, right?
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.760]   Yeah, on his face, yeah, on his skin, too, he was the one that survived the house fire,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.280]   my grandmother was covering him, but the other one had passed away, you know, his brother,
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.680]   he passed away, but, you know, by the grace of God, you know, Izzy has survived, he got
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.960]   a big, like, scar on the side of his face, but, yeah, he survived, and he was only three
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.520]   weeks old, bro, so, like, can't nobody tell me that, you know, God ain't real at all,
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.440]   can't nobody tell me that, and I'm just like, damn, like, to this day, he just like me,
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.960]   bro, like, smiling, you know, he gives so many people joy, like, you would never know
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.680]   what he been through, you would never know what he overcame, you know, and it's like,
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.400]   damn, he just like me, bro, but that's another reason why, like, man, like, we really so
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.880]   close, and when people see it through, you know, the media, or people see it in person,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.160]   like, yeah, he really doesn't play about them, like, they all so close.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.240]   So what's, so what's, through all of this, like, now, like, through basketball, you just
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.400]   use basketball as, like, a vessel for, to inspire, is that what you would say, or, you
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   know?
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.320]   Yeah, yeah, literally, you know, just to get my story, you know, heard to just different
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.920]   people across the, just the nation, bro, like, just trying to reel in people to, you know,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.400]   Jesus Christ, man, you know, like, it's, we in end times, bro, so I know, you know, it's
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.880]   almost, you know, rallying up, so.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   It's almost a wrap.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.600]   Yeah, so I'm just trying to use my, you know, my story, you know, with my gift, and just
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   try to, you know, tally in as much people as I can to, you know, home to Christ, so
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.120]   that's something that I'm really just, you know, taking pride in.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.440]   Well, you inspire me, bro, like, 'cause you right, I agree with you, that this, the time
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.120]   and the age that we're in, and the fact that nowadays, good is pretty much looked at as
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.960]   bad, and bad is looked at as good.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   But it's insane.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.880]   Bro, I could get on social media, and the things that people are, like, glorifying as
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.560]   good are literally evil, and evil is good, and, like, that's what it talks about in the
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:25.520]   Bible is end times, so, like, even just talking right now, like, you inspire me to want to,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.960]   like, help bring people in, and that's why, like, this podcast, to me, is important, because,
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.120]   like, I could have a bad basketball game and not feel like doing a podcast, but if people
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.280]   listen to this podcast and they hear our stories, because we're two people that have been through
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.320]   a lot of adversity, like, I should not, like, for me, in my story, I should not even be
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.520]   in the NBA, either, like, yeah, I was the number one player in high school, but after
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.660]   the three back surgeries, and now, you know, coming back from that, like, there's guys
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.040]   that are done after one, and there's guys, you know, the brace that I'm wearing, like,
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.880]   no one in the history of NBA has even attempted to play in a brace like that, and I'm trying
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.080]   to hoop, and it's painful, it's hard, like, adversity's hard, but the fact that it inspires,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.800]   like, someone, like, I feel like our purpose should be to get, like, our story out there
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.960]   to get people to keep going, but like you said, the main thing is bringing people towards
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:22.080]   Christ, so, like, I think the fact that you shared your story, and people get to know
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.680]   you, like, that's the most important thing.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.840]   It's hard to keep that perspective, though, like, it's hard to keep that perspective.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.520]   - It really is, but, you know, it's something that I just take pride in, bro, like, I really
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.760]   take pride in just trying to, you know, reel people in, man, just with my story, but, you
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.120]   know, I know this is a podcast where you ask me questions, but I know you've just been
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.040]   through a lot, too, bro, like, just everything that you've been through, you know, even when
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.600]   I was over there in Denver, I had seen you, you know, recovering and stuff, you know,
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.560]   before, you know, you had signed your big deal and stuff like that, I'm like, you know,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.080]   Mike is in here trying to, you know, get himself going and get back, but, you know, how was
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.680]   that, you know, for you as far as, like, just trying to, you know, your back injury, but
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.160]   on top of that, still, like, you know, wearing a brace, you know, right before you're about
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.800]   to go to training camp and trying to, like, 'cause you didn't play a season, you know,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.840]   or you didn't play, like, the whole season 'cause the season just started, then it happened,
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.520]   you know, and then just trying to get back out there.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.200]   Yeah, nobody could tell me that God isn't real either, but, like, when people ask me
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.600]   for, like, a story on why, I say, like, the contract thing because, yeah, like, I've hooped
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.440]   in this brace or whatever, like, I've hooped and I've done, like, well, like, obviously
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.640]   I'm still trying to grow, still trying to get better, still trying to heal my body,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:34.920]   but I signed that contract right before I had another injury, like, and you know in
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.040]   the NBA, like, if that injury had come, 'cause I didn't play the whole season right after
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.680]   I signed the contract, and everybody's talking about, oh, it's the worst contract in NBA
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:47.560]   history, you know, people talking crazy, but if I had gotten hurt maybe three weeks prior,
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.200]   then, boom, that big contract, and I think the reason God allowed me to have that contract,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.040]   and sometimes it's annoying because sometimes I never even cared to have money like that.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.240]   I always wanted to hoop, but now, like, once you sign a big contract, people want you to
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.040]   live up to it and they expect you to be, like, consistent every game, not knowing what you're
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.960]   going through off the court, not knowing what you're, so that has been kind of hard, because
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:19.280]   people don't know, like, how everything I've gone through, how much, but, like, I think
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.240]   no one could tell me that God not real because he allowed me to get that contract because
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   he knew, for me, you have your gifts, one of my gifts is, like, being generous, so I've
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.840]   been able to use my money, and I'm still trying to think of more ways to use it, like, in
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.080]   a way that God would be happy with, I've been able to help my family, been able to do this,
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.600]   and I never was trying to hold it onto myself, but the hard part is, like, man, people just,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:48.240]   it's the people that don't understand, we understand it, bro, and it just, it's annoying
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.120]   when people, they be, like, yo, you signed a big contract, you supposed to do this, that,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.160]   this, that, but it's, like, bro, you don't even, like, I didn't even ask for this, but
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.760]   I would've hooped for free, you could've given me a, you didn't even have to give me any
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.160]   millions of dollars, and I still would've hooped.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.000]   Still would've hooped, bro, but this is something that they just don't see and don't understand,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.920]   bro, you know, they looking from the outside in and not really looking at, you know, the
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.320]   inside and really what, you know, we go through on a daily basis, you know, what we're really
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.560]   dealing with, you know, and trying to overcome still to this day, like, nobody know how painful
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.480]   this, you know, still to this day, how that's feeling, you know, your back and your foot,
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.800]   they just care about, oh, he need to go out there and perform, he need to da-da-da, which
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.440]   they not even understanding, you're going out there, you're sacrificing your body, you
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.000]   know, which, you know, some people don't even like to do, they sit out the whole season
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.480]   'til they right, you know, 'til they feeling perfect, bro, so I'm saying, but, like, I
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.320]   salute you for that, just going out there and just, you know, trying to sacrifice your
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.640]   body because I know what you're going through, but, you know, fans that's not paying attention
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.040]   to the game, or not paying attention to you, you know, as a person, they just looking through
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.760]   the TV, oh, he missed all these shots, he da-da-da, but then when you making all these
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.680]   shots, they ain't nowhere near to be found, so it's like, what you gonna say now?
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   - Then you the next best, you, it's crazy.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.240]   - Bro, it's pathetic, bro, that's why, like, I don't get into all that, bro, I just let
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:08.840]   people just be them, bro, I don't care, bro, I could care less, bro, they fans for a reason,
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.640]   bro, that's why they called fans, bro.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.880]   - And, like, you made the point earlier, like, you could be the best player in the world,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.440]   you could literally be, well, I don't really see people talking too crazy about Nikola
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.880]   'cause he just, well, he don't even be on social media, but, like, I see people talk
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:27.800]   crazy about every player, Giannis, Bron, KD, any player can get talked crazy about, so
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.400]   it really is just about, um, just taking it in stride and dealing with the highs and the
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.360]   lows, like, we, at the end of the day, we're blessed, like, who cares what this person
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.040]   is doing, is in their crib, typing on the phone, like, who really is worried about what
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   that's saying?
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.680]   - I don't get into all that, I'm not gonna lie, all that just be for clickbait, bro,
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.800]   I don't get into all that, I just stay in my lane, bro, they got it, they got it, bro.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.400]   - Well, man, I think this has been, like, super inspiring, like, I don't like to keep
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.320]   people on the podcast too long, I just, when I get people on here, I have specific questions
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   that I want to ask.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   - Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.000]   - But I think, for me and you, we bond over the fact that we've both been through adversity
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.080]   and come out the other side, we're really both not supposed to be here, like, after
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.800]   things that we've been through, and you inspire me to continue to put my message out there,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.320]   you're very bold with yours, like, on social media, and I feel like that's something that
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:26.360]   you rarely see now, 'cause people are so worried about being canceled, or they come off too
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:32.160]   strong, or, you know, the day and age we live in, people are so, like, uh, man, people are

[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.440]   that's not how it goes, because we made it to the league, that's not how it goes, like.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440]   - Shut up and dribble, nigga.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   - Yeah, like that.

[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.520]   about the parlay, and people talking about, oh, you messed up their parlay and you lost
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:33.760]   the money, and we put that on Instagram, and I'm expecting people to be like, man, like,
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.400]   people shouldn't be on that, whatever, I seen the comments, shut up and dribble, nigga.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.120]   I was like, yo, are you kidding me, these people are--
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.440]   - Bro, they ruthless, bro, they don't care, bro, they really don't care.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.280]   But I just think we're supposed to just literally just play basketball, like, we have voices
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.120]   too, like, we have things that, other than basketball, that we're into, you know, for

[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.400]   like therapeutic to you, are you trying to get a message out there, what is the whole
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.200]   music thing about, 'cause you're actually nice, remember I was singing a song that one?
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.400]   So what's the whole music about?
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.160]   - Oh, man, so, like, you know, back, you know, in 2018, you know, with the tragedy thing
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.520]   that I was telling you about, you know, what happened to me, you know, my family, I was
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.920]   on, like, house-rest, like, bed-rest, basically, like, I couldn't, like, leave the house, you
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.120]   know, I was recovering, you know, with my patella tendon, I was down for, like, six,
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.580]   seven months, bro, and I really couldn't do nothing, but I was in a crib with all my
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.440]   boys and shit, so I was just chillin', but I always had, like, a voice where I can, like,
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.000]   you know, sing and, like, harmonize beats and stuff like that, and so I'm like, man,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.780]   maybe I can give it a shot, but, like, my homeboys, they could, like, they really know
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.000]   how to rap, so I'm like, ah, let me try this hook thing, I'ma just make the hook, and y'all

[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.700]   a very low moment of my life, like, I really had a lot of fun, though, like, 2018, 2019,
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.200]   but that really got me into the music, though, bro, then I dropped a single, and it went
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   crazy in the hook, bro.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   - Which one is that again?

[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.560]   - It might be, is it the new one?
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.040]   - Nah, it's the older one, I think, I gotta look it up, but where do you wanna take the
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   music?

[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.880]   - I can't believe that, bro, like, you literally just, you literally just was in your room
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.720]   chilling, and then you look out the door, and the flames are just going crazy.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.040]   - Watch, man, I never seen nothing like it in my life, bro.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.400]   Just imagine you open a door, bro, it's like, it, are you seeing this orange, blue, and,
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   like, red?
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   - Isn't that the craziest thing?
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   - That's, yeah.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.560]   - That's, that was really, like, some movie shit, 'cause I watch movies, bro, it's like,
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.760]   they got all the time in the world, bro, to, like, just do all this fucking thinking, and
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.320]   it's, like, you don't have that time, bro, I probably was in that room for, like, three
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   minutes, bro.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.160]   - And then you just was ready to give up, and just--
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   - Yeah, bro, I was gonna go, bro, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   - I can't believe that, bro.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.480]   - I was gonna go, like, the whole room was just cloudy, and just full of, like, just
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.240]   black smoke just coming in, and I'm like, nah, but, you know, God's voice is so powerful,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   bro, like--
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   - But you heard it, you heard it.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.000]   - Yes, bro, I swear, I was sitting there on, on my knees, bro, just ready just to go, bro,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.800]   I just, I was like, damn, like, all right, if it's my time, it's my time, like, you know,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.400]   I ain't, I feel like, you know, when God gives his time to people, it's like, you know, he's
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.720]   calling them home, so I'm like, all right, it is what it is, like, I'm just gonna go,
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.640]   but, bro, his voice so powerful, bro, I just heard it in my, in my head, bro, just get
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.080]   up, I got you, like, just get up.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.360]   - And then the reason your little nephew survived was because your grandma--
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   - My grandma was hovering over him.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.720]   - Hovered over him, and she was burnt, charcoal, and then he survived.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.560]   - Yep, mm-hmm, right over top, bro.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.600]   - Yeah, bro, he was, he said he was three weeks old.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   - Three weeks, yeah.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.760]   - I just can't believe, like, the smoke inflation.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.960]   - It's the grace of God, it was so crazy, like, literally went to the hospital that night,
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   like, my grandma, she didn't, like, say she passed away yet, I think it, like, got to
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.040]   her, like, almost the next day, like, the middle of the night, it said she passed, but, like,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.760]   I just kept hearing my, like, my nephew, he's, like, he has a chance to make it, like, he's
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.400]   alive, like, I'm like, I'm like, wow, this is fucking crazy, bro, like, but they sent
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.040]   up my other baby cousin that passed, but we literally had one more, just, like, just here,
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.840]   and it's just the grace of God, bro, like, it's just crazy.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.800]   - Wait, who ran in, was it the ambulance that ran in there and got them, or who was it?
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.600]   - Yeah, yeah, the ambulance ran in there and got them, but it, like, the, I live, like,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:41.040]   literally down the street from the fire station, they took so long to get there, I'm like,
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.360]   bro, like, I swear to God, I can walk down there, like, I'm like, bro, it's literally
