[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (slow hip hop music)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.760]   - Man, welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   I'm here with my guy, Bones.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.800]   - My guy, MP STEVE.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.920]   - Appreciate you on the podcast, my boy.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.400]   - Yo.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520]   - Man, so I remember when you got drafted,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.880]   you came in the locker room, said what's up to everybody,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.760]   and we clicked, I think.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000]   I really appreciated your authenticity,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.080]   and I noticed that just from the jump when we first met.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   - Yeah.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.880]   - And then you just proved it over and over,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.600]   like no matter what's going on,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.320]   you're always gonna be Bones.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.380]   When you're in the game, it don't matter who's in the game,
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.480]   you're gonna be Bones.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.880]   And I just feel like we clicked,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.360]   so I appreciate you hopping on the podcast, my brother.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.680]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.720]   You know, definitely, being drafted by the Nuggets,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.800]   it was definitely huge for me, you know.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200]   It was a blessing, you know,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.480]   just overcoming what I overcame, you know, in my life.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.720]   And then being drafted, 26th pick by the Nuggets,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.960]   it was big for me, man, it was everything.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.840]   I didn't really know what to expect, you know,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.040]   coming to Denver.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.400]   I thought it was really cold, but I got on the plane,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280]   and it seemed like the sun was out.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.760]   I'm like, damn, this is different.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.800]   It seemed like it's hot out.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.640]   - Yeah.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880]   - But, you know, the first time I came to the arena,
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.200]   I think the first person I saw was you
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.000]   when I walked into the pool room,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.280]   and I'm like, what's up, NP?
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.080]   But we definitely just clicked from there.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.320]   You know, Genuine Vibes and Genuine Souls always,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.600]   you know, connect with Genuine Souls,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.440]   and ever since then, it's just been like a lock, for sure.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.280]   - No, for sure.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.800]   I remember, bro, like, I realized you were a killer,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.040]   and like, it was your rookie season, right?
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920]   And I think we were in training camp in San Diego,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.680]   and I'll never forget this.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280]   I think I came down and like, hit like a heasy pull-up,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.440]   but I think you were on the side,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.120]   like, waiting for me to pass it,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.280]   and you was like, I hit the shot,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.320]   but you were like, Mike, like, I can do that, too.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.240]   You can pass the pass, like, okay, like, he's cold.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.320]   Like, and this is your rookie season, like,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.000]   and you just were so confident, bro.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So, it was like, it was a joy to watch you play,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.720]   and like, be your teammate, you know?
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.200]   And then, so, I think I kind of was hurt
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.880]   during the time when you,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.520]   when they were talking about the trade rumors,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.680]   and when you, that's cool, that's his phone?
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.120]   Yeah, I think I was hurt during the time
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.280]   the trade rumors came around,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.840]   so I really didn't know what happened,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.200]   but man, now you're, you end up going to LA,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.400]   and I've been tuned in, obviously,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.960]   but how has everything been for you over there?
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.800]   Are you enjoying it?
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   - Yeah, yeah, it's been lovely, man.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.360]   It's been dope, obviously, coming from Denver,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.520]   a situation where I thrived in, you know?
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.560]   I was having fun playing over there, stuff like that,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520]   but I just felt like it just needed a change for me,
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.320]   needed different scenery, and obviously,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.360]   over here in LA, I think it's a beautiful thing for me.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.040]   I'm learning under four future Hall of Famers,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.840]   just staying ready, staying patient.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.020]   Obviously, last year, I came around February time.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.000]   You know, it was kind of hard just to learn, you know,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.320]   it wasn't hard learning the plays or learning, you know,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.760]   I mean, obviously, if you're a Hooper,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.240]   you know you're gonna fit in with whatever,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.480]   but just having to move from one state to another,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.840]   one team to another, you know,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.320]   having to learn the new staff, new players,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.400]   everybody names, the play calls, it's tough, you know?
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.760]   And obviously, on top of that,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.040]   you're still trying to perform,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.880]   and you know, still trying to, you know,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   earn that roster spot as well, too,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.840]   coming in from another team,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.040]   but I feel like I did that,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.760]   and obviously, this year, you know,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.240]   just playing well off the bat,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.280]   and then, you know, a trade happened,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.160]   and you know, you just get bumped down
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   and out of the rotation,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   but I feel like it's, you know,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.840]   even though it may not look like it's a good thing for me,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.080]   I still look at it as a good thing,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.680]   'cause I'm still learning under four future Hall of Famers,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.840]   and I know my time will come,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.360]   so I'm really not, you know, too down on it.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.200]   Obviously, I wanna play, but I ain't too down, though.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.680]   - Yeah, no, you always smiling,
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.960]   you always have had a good attitude about everything,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.120]   even, you know, when things,
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.240]   like in Denver, you know, you know how the NBA is.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.560]   Even in Denver, when things weren't going good,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.360]   you always maintained a smile,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.000]   and so I've been checking up on you, even in L.A.,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.480]   just because even times last year,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.960]   you weren't playing as much as you were supposed to,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.200]   or whatever, and now,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.600]   but you have always just maintained, like,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   the attitude, the good attitude,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.560]   and you're young, bro, you're gonna end up,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.720]   you're gonna end up doing your thing,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.800]   but that leads me to a question, like,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.480]   you played so well, you know,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   obviously, in the off-season,
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.280]   you be killing every run, you know,
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.080]   and you just go, and, you know,
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.480]   you're like the highlight of the summer,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.520]   everybody be looking at the Bones Highlands,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.640]   Pro-Am videos, or whatever.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.240]   How do you maintain, like,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.880]   is the NBA, for people that don't know the NBA,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.120]   is it as fun as the summer,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.320]   like, is basketball as fun to you in the NBA,
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.160]   when you're playing, or not?
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.840]   Like, is it as fun as when you're doing your thing,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.800]   in the summertime? - Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   That's a great question.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.880]   I would say it's kinda different.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.960]   You know, by the same time,
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.880]   I feel like if I had, you know,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.920]   the keys, or if I had to, you know,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.400]   just go out there and just be yourself,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.680]   and, you know, with no leash on you,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.560]   no minute thing going on,
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.800]   I feel like it'd be the same thing
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.120]   that's going on in the summertime,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   but the summertime, you just playing,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.240]   you just playing, I feel like
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.840]   everybody's so in tune with me,
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.520]   you know, they love seeing me play,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.000]   and just be free, and you know,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.880]   they be like, man, if he just had, you know,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.360]   the leash off of him, if he just go,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   he'd be-- - Everybody knows.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.360]   - Yeah, everybody know, you know,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   but, you know, at the same time,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.240]   I'm just waiting my turn, waiting patiently,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.800]   but, man, the summertime, you know,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.280]   who's be so fun, 'cause I could just really
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.120]   just go out there and just be me, you know?
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.560]   Even though I'd be me in the league, too,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.880]   but it's more in spurt, like,
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.720]   it's like the whole time, the whole game,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   I'm just wilding. - Oh, yeah, you born
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.120]   in somebody's head.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.800]   - I'm just wilding.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.400]   - Did you always, like, okay, so,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.640]   obviously, nowadays, a lot of people
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.960]   grow up with trainers, and they grow up with,
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.440]   you know, they go through drills.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.200]   Your game is so unique, because the way you grew up,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.600]   where you grew up, hooping, you know, on a park.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   How did that, because most, like,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   hoopers that grow up that way don't make it to the NBA.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.360]   They don't know how to defend to structure and all that.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   How did you kind of grow up, and how did your game,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.240]   like, how is it the way it is?
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.160]   Because the way you handle the ball is so unique,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.600]   the way you, you know, the showtime,
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.720]   the flashiness. - Facts.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.080]   - Like, is that just the way you grew up,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   or how did you grow up hooping?
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.200]   - Yeah, that's definitely the way I grew up.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.080]   I grew up on a lot of park basketball,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.120]   a lot of recreational basketball.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.600]   Recreational basketball, however you say it.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.560]   But, you know, I grew up on a lot of that,
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.360]   honestly, just playing, going to gyms,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.320]   you know, playing one-on-one, two-on-two,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.280]   three-on-threes, you know, literally all day.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.800]   Like, sunup, sundown, you know.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   At first, like, it was kind of hard to get on the court,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.360]   you know, 'cause they're like, you gotta wait your turn,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.240]   you know, you're younger, you know.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.560]   And I'm just on the sideline, just practicing my moves,
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   you know, I'm just shooting the ball in the air,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.360]   stuff like that, but just watching, just live basketball.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   You know, I've been taking so many notes and stuff,
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.280]   just young, and I knew, like,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.360]   once I be able to get on the court,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.200]   I knew I'd be ready.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   But, man, just how it just translated to the NBA,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   just honestly in the gym and just working.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.840]   You know, try to, like, simplify some things, you know.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.640]   You know, obviously, sometimes you can be a little flashy,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.000]   you can show your flashes of, you know,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.800]   being fancy here and there on a fast break.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.640]   You can throw a dime, you can turn around,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   you know, just get the crowd into it.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.680]   That's how I always been, you know.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.480]   I never wanted to, like, change that
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.120]   or, you know, let somebody change that part of me
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.480]   because I'm a very, you know, entertaining player.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.760]   A lot of people like seeing me play.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.600]   They love watching me.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.440]   So, it's like, I never just changed that
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.080]   because, oh, this doesn't fit the criteria of, you know,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.800]   a coach like this or, you know,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600]   somebody don't like the way I play, dah, dah, dah.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.000]   Nah, that's never been me because at the end of the day,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.960]   it's like, I'm not gonna change who I am, you know.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.800]   This is what got me here.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.640]   I'm not just gonna change who I am now, you know,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.880]   just because I made it to the league.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.920]   No, I'm gonna forever be me.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.040]   So, you know, that's definitely how I grew up, though.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.600]   You know, a lot of park basketball.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.480]   - Yeah, nah.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.040]   Like I said, bro, that's one thing I admire.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.880]   Like, can't nobody tell you, like, your confidence
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.080]   and just the swag you play with.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.040]   Can't nobody tell you you're not the coldest.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.400]   For people that don't know, like,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.320]   me and Bones would have shooting contests
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.440]   after every shoot-around.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.040]   - I'm crying.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.080]   - Every shoot-around, we would do our little shoot-contest,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   me and him.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.160]   Sometimes, other people would join,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.520]   but they never would win.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.640]   But I could say Bones is one of the only people, like,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.960]   I've shot against.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.840]   It's you, Steph, and, like, maybe one other person.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.160]   - Yeah, probably Trey.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.120]   - Trey, Trey.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   But, like, that can consistently beat me.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.240]   Like, he would beat me most days.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.920]   I would be so hot.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.080]   But, like, as flashy as your game is,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.120]   like, it's still very, very polished.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.800]   - Who did you grow up, like, who did you grow up idolizing?
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.480]   Who'd you try to model your game after?
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.160]   - You know, that's such a tough question.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.240]   'Cause I really never try to, like,
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.920]   modelize my game after nobody.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.200]   I love watching hoop, though, you know?
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.000]   But, like, I love taking, like, flat, like, game,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.760]   like, or my moves from different players
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.600]   and stuff like that.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   But I never went, like, oh, yeah,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.840]   I just wanna be just like him.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.240]   Like, this is my idol, da-da-da, you know?
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.080]   That's never been me.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.760]   But a guy who, like, I always watch was Hot Sauce.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.160]   Hot Sauce is the only guy, you know, I just watch.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.880]   And that's somebody, like, I come home from school,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.440]   you know, I eat a bowl of cereal.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.680]   You know, I turn him on, on the phone,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.240]   I prop the phone up, and after I finish eating my cereal,
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.920]   I grab the basketball and go in the mirror,
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.080]   and I just practice all his moves and stuff.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.320]   With his big shirt on, you know,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.160]   the big shirts he used to wear.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.320]   - He was cold, he was cold, though.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.480]   - Fatsy was cold.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.440]   - So that makes sense, then, why you hoop the way you hoop.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.920]   - I used to always just watch him, bro,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.320]   and I'd just go to the gym and try to practice his moves,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.480]   and it was working.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.520]   But, like, I didn't wanna be too much, like,
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.680]   you know, doing way too much.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.960]   Yeah, you know, but I still, like, try to, like,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.880]   try to amplify some of that in my game,
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.440]   and that gave me, like, my flair, like, my swag,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.520]   you know, like, you know, it gave me that,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.760]   nah, I can't nobody, like, fuck me on the court type shit.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.080]   You know, that gave me that vibe, though.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.240]   - Yeah, it's a video that went viral, a YouTube video.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.600]   I'd just seen it, like, like, I didn't even know about it
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.560]   'til I started playing with you,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.920]   but it's a viral video of you playing one-on-one.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.840]   They was some bums, but you was going head dudes,
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.600]   and I think you were younger, and they was getting hot.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.440]   - Yeah.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.600]   - Yeah, y'all can look it up, Bones Island one-on-one.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.360]   - I definitely know it was one you talking about, for sure.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.120]   I just was watching it the other day.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.720]   - But, like, how old were you during that?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.200]   Like, was that, like, a normal thing
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.320]   for you to just go to the park
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.640]   and be playing one-on-one with dudes,
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.000]   and the cameras be out and all that?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.800]   - Yeah, so, like, it's a big back story to that.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.160]   So, you know, for everybody who don't know,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.960]   this was a video that went viral.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.760]   I was about 17 years old.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.520]   But it's a league called Tech Rock League.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.000]   It's a league that I played in growing up.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.520]   A lot of, you know, kids went from Wilmington to Delaware,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.360]   even, you know, Philadelphia area, you know, Tri-State area.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.040]   A lot of people come down and play in the league.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.840]   And, you know, it was one game that's going on,
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.160]   and we were waiting 'til it was done.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.880]   And it was, like, me, it was, like, six other people,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.920]   and it was the two owners that, you know,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.040]   made the Tech Rock League up, you know?
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.920]   And, you know, we just conversating about basketball,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.160]   you know, then they got to the comparison game.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.440]   And I'm, like, I'm staying out of it.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.280]   I ain't saying nothing.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.120]   I ain't saying nothing.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.760]   I'm staying out of it, you know?
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.160]   But then I got brought up, and I'm, like, nah.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.080]   That's, like, hey, nah, y'all tripping.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.600]   I'm not comparing to nobody.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.880]   And they just kept saying, yeah, you know,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.000]   I can beat him one-on-one.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.680]   You know, I can beat, you know, Bones one-on-one,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.520]   and da-da-da.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.360]   And I'm, like, you tripping.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.200]   It's a court right here.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.640]   We can go check out right now.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.200]   It's a court literally right here.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.160]   We walked on the court, and the first guy, you know,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.920]   I just feel like, you know, I don't know.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   I think it felt like his pride got in the way.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.560]   - It did, it did.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.400]   - He got in the way.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.520]   - He was playing way, bro.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.320]   - His pride got in the way too much.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.520]   But the second guy, who was seven, though,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.240]   his pride was way higher, though.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.720]   Like, he knew, like, he just let the people
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.480]   where he was from, you know, he's from Philadelphia,
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.320]   but he let the people, like, get in his ear.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.480]   Yeah, go out there and, you know, play and stuff.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.320]   - He was trying to play it mad hard.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.160]   - Mad hard.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   (laughing)
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.960]   And I'm, like, you know, it's not going to end
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.800]   how you want it to end.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.960]   I'm just, like, nah.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.320]   And I didn't even know that, like,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.280]   this was going to be a viral video, though, bro.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.920]   I was just going out there, just being myself,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.480]   all the people around that was watching,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.320]   everybody just being there.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.600]   So, we didn't know that the guy who recorded the video,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.640]   we didn't know he was going to drop it,
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.720]   or he was actually recording, you know?
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.800]   But it got so much attention and stuff.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.840]   I'm, like, nah, he definitely going to drop this.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   And ever since then, that joint just blew up, bro.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.680]   - That video is OD.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.080]   - But you know what's crazy, though, bro?
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.040]   A lot of people, like, they, like,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.520]   oh, that's the guy from the video that went viral.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.760]   Like, they look at me now, like,
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.600]   wow, that's the guy from the video.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.080]   - That's how viral that video is?
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.760]   - Yes, bro, like, to this day, like,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.800]   that's the guy from the video that went viral.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.600]   I'm, like, damn, they remember that video?
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.440]   That's crazy, bro.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.200]   - Nah, it's a hilarious video, bro,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   'cause it's just like you now, like,
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.720]   the way you talking crazy to dudes.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   And they were so hot, like, they were so mad, bro.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.560]   - They definitely was.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.800]   - But nah, nah, back to the league, like,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.000]   I was watching a podcast, I think it was Emmanuel Moutier
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.800]   on someone's podcast, and he was just talking about
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.240]   he lost his love for the game.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.680]   And, like, you've always been, like,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.920]   you can see in that video, you can see,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.240]   even the way you hoop now, your love for the game.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.800]   He was talking about he lost his love for the game
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.080]   because of how political the league is.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.320]   He was like, I would be killing somebody
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.520]   in practice every day, but the coach tells me
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.560]   I'm not gonna play right now.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.000]   And, like, obviously, we've talked about Tyloo.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.840]   Tyloo's from Missouri, like, that's my guy.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.120]   That's like, he's from 30 minutes down the street
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.640]   from where I'm from, and he's the most chillest dude ever.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.480]   - Yeah, he is chill, for sure.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.240]   - But do you feel like, not just in your situation,
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.400]   but now that you've been in the NBA,
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.360]   how political do you feel like it is?
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.480]   Like, is it dudes to you, like,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.800]   every day could be killing in practice
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.040]   that literally don't play in the game,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.280]   or do you think the best players always play?
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.920]   - Yeah, it's definitely a political game,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.760]   but it's something that you just can't control, bro.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.200]   Like, you know, I could be killing every day in practice,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.600]   you know, but it's just like, it's just gonna go how it go,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.680]   because maybe somebody been there, you know, years,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.000]   or maybe you're on a contract that's way bigger than yours,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.240]   and it's just gonna go the way it goes.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.000]   But, I mean, it's something that you really
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.840]   just can't control.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.360]   Maybe he got a couple years over you,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.800]   and you just getting in the league,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   or you're just your second year, but you killing, though.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.440]   But, he on a crazy contract, you know,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.080]   but he playing over you, playing, you know, mad minutes.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.440]   But it's something that you, excuse me,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.080]   it's really something that you just can't control, bro.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   - Right.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.960]   - It's tough, you know, 'cause it's like,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.360]   man, I wish I was playing a little bit more, you know.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.400]   You know, I feel like I deserve to play a little bit more.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.440]   You know, I'm already killing it
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.560]   with the minutes that I'm getting.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.760]   Why can't I get a little bit, like, 10 more, you know?
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.600]   - Yeah.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.760]   - Like, I feel like I deserve it, you know.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.440]   But, man, it's definitely a political game,
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.280]   but it's just something that you just
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.200]   can't get caught up in, man.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.040]   You just gotta stay, like, level-headed, you know,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.880]   just stay out of that, man.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.760]   - And you never let that affect, like, your joy?
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.600]   - Yeah.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.440]   - You don't let it affect your joy?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440]   - Nah, not at all.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.280]   You know me, bro.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.040]   Like, I ain't gonna let nothing shake me, bro.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.640]   It's like, but at the same time,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.080]   it just be kinda tough, though, it do,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   because, like, you know, you just wanna play, bro.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.760]   And that's me, like, I just wanna hoot, you know.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.880]   So, it's like, ah, this political game
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.440]   could definitely get tough, but, man,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.480]   it's something you just really can't control, bro.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.600]   It's really something you can't, facts.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.120]   - Nah, 100%, nah.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.320]   You, I mean, you know, like, you a star.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.400]   Everybody knows, I think I was watching PG's podcast,
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.280]   and he was talking about the way you play,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.360]   how you are as a star.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.520]   And you got, like you said,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.400]   y'all got four Hall of Famers right now, like.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.240]   - Yeah, bro.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.760]   - And y'all still figuring it out,
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   but whether it's there or somewhere else,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.800]   like, you gonna blossom.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.560]   So, it's never any stress in that area.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   I wanna turn to, like, your faith,
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.680]   because you do have an unshakable joy,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.560]   which is something I've always appreciated about you.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.320]   Even, like, when you were with us,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.920]   I'd be down sometimes, you would keep my spirits lifted
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.760]   if something was wrong.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.600]   - Facts.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.440]   - Even if you weren't playing,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.200]   you still were cheering me on in the game.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.040]   - Facts.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.520]   - But you tweet, or you put on Instagram very boldly,
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.280]   like, about your faith.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.120]   - Yeah.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.840]   - Like, in God, and just how important that is to you.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.720]   Has that always been, like, an important part of your life,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.400]   and is that kinda what keeps you kinda, like,
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.520]   level-headed through everything?
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.880]   - Man, yeah, man, that's the biggest part of my life,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.760]   honestly, man, 'cause I done been through so much,
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   but, you know, Jesus has never, you know,
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.400]   forsaken me at all.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.680]   Like, he always been there for me,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.000]   like, regardless, like, how, you know,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.760]   impossible something may seem,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.720]   how, like, un-extraordinary something may seem.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.800]   It's like, he's just always there for me.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.120]   And it's like, I can never, like, turn on him,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.120]   no matter if, like, things get, you know, worse for me,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.520]   or maybe I don't like how something's going, you know,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.640]   or maybe some life problems that I'm going through.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.960]   I just know, like, I'm always be, you know, straight,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.560]   because I got, you know, God on my side,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.920]   and it's never gonna make me, like, turn away from,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.640]   you know, him because something not going my way.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.320]   You know, I feel like a lot of people nowadays,
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   like, they quick to, like, you know,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.880]   why me, or, you know, why am I going through this,
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.680]   you know, but not even knowing, like,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   maybe this can, you know, help you, you know,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.400]   on your path going forward.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.960]   - Diversity can, like, shape you.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.240]   - Yeah, exactly, you know, and I feel like
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.640]   that's something I'm going through right now.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.800]   Like, this right now, it's shaping me right now.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   You know, it's building resilience in me, you know,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.120]   it's building patience in me, you know,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.320]   and it's building, like, just even more high character,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.280]   you know, so it's something that I definitely,
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.400]   you know, appreciate right now,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.840]   even though I wanna play, but at the same time,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.040]   I know God is, you know, strengthening me, you know,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.920]   getting stronger off the floor, you know,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.760]   and stuff like that, so it's,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.680]   I feel like it's really, it has helped me,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.920]   but I think definitely never shake, though, at all.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.240]   - Never, nah.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.040]   You, we were talking about this before the podcast started,
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.280]   just about how, like, the fans, even in Denver,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.400]   how people can be so for you.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.520]   - In life, in general, any NBA player deals with this.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.480]   - That people can be so for you,
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.720]   but as soon as you do one thing they don't like
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.120]   or they perceive something that's not even how it was,
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.840]   they turn on you, and I think we've talked about
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.620]   a little bit, even the Denver fans,
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.560]   'cause you were a fan favorite.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.920]   Like, every time you hopped on the floor,
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.800]   you're going crazy, and just the fact
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.240]   that you received backlash for any negativity,
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.920]   I asked AG this in my podcast the other day,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.240]   how do you deal with the positivity and negativity?
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.260]   'Cause there's been so much positivity surrounding you,
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.200]   but then one thing goes wrong, and now there's negativity,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.880]   do you, how do you deal with all that?
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.520]   - So, honestly, man, I just be taking it like,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.920]   all right, they just showing love because I'm killing,
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.720]   you know, or they, at this moment, they showing me love,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.120]   but I don't let it get too head over heels,
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.480]   like, ah, I'm so in, you know, with the, you know,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.000]   how they treating me and stuff like that.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.720]   Like, obviously I love it, but it always, like,
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.920]   you know, something go wrong, they just gonna turn on you.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.040]   It's just like, it's just what happens, bro.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.740]   It happens to literally, like, you know,
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.240]   Hall of Famers who played and stuff like that.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.080]   - The best players in the world.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.900]   - The best players, bro.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.400]   So it's like, of course it can happen to me,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.720]   so I don't be too, like, locked in on it.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.000]   Of course, like, I appreciate, you know,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.720]   fan bases that, you know, take me in
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.320]   and, like, really cheer me on.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.640]   They appreciate my game, they appreciate
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.680]   how fun I have on the floor, you know.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.180]   Speaking of Denver fans, you know,
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.640]   when I was over there, you know, I checked in
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.720]   and they, they weren't, like, rowdy every time.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.240]   Like, they love watching me play,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.400]   but obviously the trade went down and it happened.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.800]   Now it's, everybody just, like, hate me,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.440]   like, you know, but I feel like they don't really,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.480]   I feel like they don't really hate me.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.380]   They still got love for me, but it's just the fact that
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.720]   I'm just not there anymore, it's making 'em kinda like,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.560]   damn, like, we just gonna go at it,
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.640]   we just gonna keep, you know, going at it,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.880]   even stuff like that, but I still got love for Denver, bro.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.160]   Like, it took me in with open arms.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.920]   Like, I never just say, like, F Denver.

[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.160]   It took me in with open arms.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.800]   Every time I checked on the floor, I had fun, you know, so.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.640]   - Right.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.400]   - Yeah, I don't know, it's something that, like,
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.920]   you just gotta, you just gotta just hoop, bro.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.360]   You can't really get into the whole fan thing and all that,
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.280]   you know, you just can't get into that, bro.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.200]   - Facts.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.000]   You talked before, you was, like, talking about
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.480]   what has shaped you into this person
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.960]   is the things you've gone through.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   I remember, yeah, back in San Diego,
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.760]   when we was just chopping it up on the training table.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.680]   I'll never forget this conversation.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.840]   Like, I don't know how it came up,
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.200]   but you talked about what you went through
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.520]   and you was telling me, like, this is what,
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.720]   this is why I am, this is how I am,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.600]   this is why I smile so much.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.640]   - Can you talk a little bit to people,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.040]   because I think, like, more than just a basketball player,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.640]   like, you inspire so many people because,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.800]   and people don't even know your story like that,
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.840]   but I do, and I, to see you smile through that,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.880]   to see the way you take care of your mom and your nephew,
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   like, people don't even know where all that comes from.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.120]   Can you a little bit talk about
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.280]   the incident during high school?
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.120]   - Yeah, facts.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.080]   So, back in 2018, you know, I had went through
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   a house fire tragedy, you know what happened,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.760]   and, you know, I was watching March Madness in my room,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.720]   and I was on the phone with one of my friends,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.480]   and, you know, I'm just literally just chilling,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.640]   just laying back, and it's like a,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.080]   I forget what day it was.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.840]   You know, it was like a Saturday or not,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.120]   I forget which one of those days it was,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.920]   but, you know, I'm just chilling back,
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.720]   and it's one of those days where everybody
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.160]   just be, you know, chilling in the crib,
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.520]   like, nobody bothering each other,
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.840]   you know, everybody just resting and stuff like that,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.760]   and, you know, I'm watching the game and stuff,
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   and just chilling, and I just get up out my bed
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.120]   'cause I start smelling, like, you know, smoke
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.680]   just surrounding just, like, my, like, just outside,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.080]   like, and I'm like, damn, like, what's that smell?
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.400]   But, you know, like, that type of smell is normal
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.840]   for, you know, where I grew up, you know,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.640]   and it's normal, people think it's a barbecue,
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.240]   you know, or it's a cookout going on,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.080]   so I'm like, yeah, it's normal,
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.760]   so I just sat back in my bed,
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.120]   and it started getting more intense, intense, intense,
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.400]   I'm like, damn, what's that smell?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.040]   Like, that's not like a barbecue,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.480]   it smell like something burning, like something on fire.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.600]   So, you know, I get out of my bed,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.680]   and I had, you know, went to my door,
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.960]   and I had opened my door,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.560]   and I just see all these flames just bursting,
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.960]   and I'm like, oh, shit, what the hell going on?
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.560]   So I instantly had to close the door,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.040]   and I had went into my room,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.680]   and I had to just sit there and just, like,
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.800]   think, like, damn, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.560]   And mind you, what's already clicking in my head
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.360]   is my grandma and my two baby cousins is in the other room,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.640]   and I'm like, damn, like,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.200]   how can I get over there to their room
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.840]   and see, you know, try to save them,
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.720]   or, you know, see what I can do, what plan I can do?
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.240]   But, you know, in movies, you can just think so,
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.040]   you know, they got all this time to think,
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.640]   you know, they go from one scene,
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.240]   you know, of the fire or something,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.560]   and them try to, you know, escape that,
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.400]   and then they go to another scene,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.520]   and then they come back to the fire,
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.560]   and then, it don't work like that, you know?
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.520]   That was something that, like,
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.720]   man, I really had to, like, think fast, you know,
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.880]   with such little time.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.560]   And, you know, I'm just sitting down,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.720]   I'm trying to really figure out how I'm gonna do this,
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.880]   but I live in an old house,
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.680]   so I'm like, the windows ain't gonna open,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.200]   like, them windows never open,
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.040]   so I'm like, yeah, it might be over with for me.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.920]   So I went to one of the windows to try to open,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.760]   but, like, it didn't open,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.600]   and now the smoke and everything
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.760]   is really getting, like, inside the room.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.520]   Flames is starting to come in,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.160]   the walls is getting hot.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.760]   As I'm touching the windows, it's a little hot,
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.240]   so I'm like, ah, like,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.960]   you know, I touched the first window, it didn't open.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.800]   Now I'm really, like, cloudy,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   and I can't really see, you know?
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.480]   And I try to touch the second one, it's hot.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.120]   I'm trying to open it, I'm like, nah,
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.240]   I'm just gonna go, like,
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.040]   it's really not opening for me.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.480]   I dropped to my knees, I'm like,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.040]   God, like, I really don't understand
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.120]   why this is happening to me.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.760]   Like, I feel like I did everything I was,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.720]   you know, supposed to do.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.560]   I feel like I'm a great person to people.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.360]   You know, I always, you know, give.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.000]   You know, I never really, you know,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.840]   I don't ask to receive from anybody.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.560]   You know, I always wanna do my deeds,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.280]   you know, in your honor.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.520]   So I just be like, dang, man,
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.080]   this is, you know, crazy to happen to me.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.280]   And, you know, as I'm just sitting down,
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.320]   I'm just praying, I'm like, man,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.480]   if it's my time to go, I'm just gonna go, you know?
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.840]   But I just hear that voice in my head, like,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.080]   get up, like, I got you, get up.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.400]   And it's like, it's not your time to go yet.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.760]   And he's like, you know,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.200]   that window's gonna open to you, the third one.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.520]   So I'm like, it's no way, bro, it's no way.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.840]   So I get up, I get up, I go to the window,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   and I just try to just open it, and it's open.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.160]   I'm like, wow, this is crazy.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.720]   So I open up, I see somebody outside.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.560]   I'm like, my house is on fire, my house is on fire.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.440]   Come save me.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.880]   He's like, you gotta jump, you gotta jump.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.600]   I'm like, I can't jump, it's too high.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.920]   It's a three-story floor house.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.480]   I'm like, I cannot jump.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.080]   You gotta jump, we need you, you our last hope.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.240]   When I heard that, I'm like, damn, bro,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.680]   like, I really am the last hope from Wilmington, Delaware.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.080]   So small, everybody depending on me to make it,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.360]   and stuff like that.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.040]   So I'm just like, all right, fuck it.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.680]   But after he said that, though, lie to you not,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.120]   I went back in the room, got on, you know, my knees.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.640]   I'm like, man, I'm just gonna go, I can't jump,
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.760]   it's too high.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.280]   Just hear a voice in my head, God, just get up,
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.560]   just get up, just get up.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.960]   I just said, fuck it, went out the window.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.200]   I just jumped head first.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.440]   I had to turn my patella tendon,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.040]   I hit my knees on the bricks.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.200]   I tried to get up and crawl, I couldn't walk.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.120]   I tried to call to the car, you know,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.040]   to the lady who had a phone.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.360]   I'm like, call my mom, call my mom.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.640]   My mom was at a place called Main Event.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.800]   And, you know, she was there with, like,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.440]   a couple of my other family members, cousins and stuff,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.000]   just having, like, a fun day.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.280]   I forgot my mom's phone number.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.960]   So I'm like, I don't know what's going on.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.120]   My head's spinning, you know, I can't walk,
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.560]   I can't do anything, you know.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.680]   So I'm like, damn, I forgot my mom's phone number.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.160]   Anybody know my mom's number?
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.920]   It just clicked in my head, I called mom.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.360]   You know, number literally just clicked in my head,
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.200]   it was so crazy.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.960]   I called mom, the house on fire.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.640]   She drove so fast back to the crib.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.760]   I just seen my mom just come, what's going on?
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.080]   House on fire, da, da, da.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.280]   My mom in there with the baby,
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.680]   with the baby cousin, stuff like that.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.240]   You know, her nephews.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.360]   And that shit was just so crazy, bro.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.240]   And then their mom, she came from McDonald's
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.880]   'cause they had got food for them.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.840]   And she came from McDonald's, she seen the house on fire.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.400]   She dropped the McDonald's to the floor.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.600]   I just see her trying to run in there
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.840]   to try to save her mom or her sons.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.040]   It's like, damn, this shit is crazy.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.760]   Then once it all, like probably 10 minutes go past,
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.120]   I had seen my grandmother and my baby brother walk out.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.640]   Not walk out, but get carried out in the ambulance thing.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.160]   I mean, the little walker thing,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.320]   the little stretcher thing.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.000]   I just seen, you know, just all of them just covered up
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.840]   in just charcoal.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.680]   I'm like, damn, like, this is like crazy.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.200]   But it was such just a, like, a tough thing for me, man.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.440]   Even to this day, like, it's really been like hard.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.800]   You know, sometimes I can't speak about it,
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.760]   sometimes I can't.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.560]   Every time I speak about it, it's so hard.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.240]   Like, it just still be like flashbacks
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.080]   in the back of my head.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.960]   It's so hard to get my words out, you know.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.040]   It be tough, man, but, you know, I never like,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.920]   like, just to this day, like, that's why I'm so big on,
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.720]   you know, speaking on, you know, God
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.000]   and, you know, having that faith in God.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.560]   'Cause that, like, I'm really not supposed to be here.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.280]   So, you know, I know, you know, my calling is, you know,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.200]   bringing people back home to Jesus
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.440]   and believing in him and believing that, you know,
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.160]   whatever you're going through, you know,
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.400]   it's always a brighter side.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.240]   He always can pull you through.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.600]   So, that's something that, you know,
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.240]   I know it's my calling, but I do that through basketball.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.840]   - Bro, like, every time I hear that story,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.440]   like, it just, it touches my heart.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.600]   Not just because of what you've been through,
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.040]   but how you turn that around, bro.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.520]   Like, I don't know too many people that would take that
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   and turn it around into what you've turned it around to
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.800]   and become the person through it that you've become.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.360]   And, like, just giving people back at the crib,
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.000]   like, just hope and people just,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.960]   how bold you are about your faith, like.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.920]   - Yeah.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.400]   - I forget what game it was,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.040]   and you had the whole hood there, bro.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.860]   - Yeah, it was the sixth game.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.960]   - Like, it was all behind you, bro.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.760]   You, it's like 50, how many people was in the crowd?
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.840]   - Bro, it was a whole world in there.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.400]   - Bro, and I was like, the fact that this dude, like,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.240]   overcame what he came.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.400]   - Five fighters was there too.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.280]   - That story is like, man, people,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.480]   that's like a story from a movie, like.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.320]   - Yeah.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.560]   - Is it, is that, like, part of the reason
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.240]   you and just your mom and your nephews are so close?
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.800]   - Yeah, bro, like, we just all best friends, bro.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.560]   We, like, closer than close, bro.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   Like, I really, my mom is my best friend, bro.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.520]   But, like, you know, people see me with my little nephew.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.600]   You know, I call him my baby brother.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.720]   He's really my cousin, but I call him my nephew,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.920]   my baby brother, like, he's just everything in one, bro.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.200]   But I really call him my angel on earth
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.680]   because he survived the house fire.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.520]   - He has the burn, right?
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.600]   - Yeah, on his face, yeah, on his skin too.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.760]   He was the one that survived the house fire.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.120]   My grandmother was covering him,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.640]   but the other one had passed away.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.880]   You know, his brother, he passed away,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.000]   but, you know, by the grace of God, you know,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.200]   Izzy had survived.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.380]   He had a big, like, scar on the side of his face,
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.000]   but yeah, he survived, and he was only three weeks old, bro.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.480]   So, like, can't nobody tell me that, you know,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   God ain't real at all.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.680]   Can't nobody tell me that.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.560]   And I'm just like, damn, like, to this day,
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.320]   he just like me, bro, like, smiling, you know.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.960]   He gives so many people joy.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.860]   Like, you would never know what he been through.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.200]   You would never know what he overcame, you know.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.000]   And it's like, damn, he just like me, bro.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.920]   But that's another reason why, like, man, like,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.880]   we really so close, and when people see it through,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.680]   you know, the media, or people see it in person,
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.560]   like, yeah, he really doesn't play about them.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.120]   Like, they all so close.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.720]   - So, what's, through all of this, like, now,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.320]   like, through basketball, you just use basketball
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.880]   as, like, a vessel for, to inspire?
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.080]   Is that what you would say?
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.400]   - Yeah, yeah, literally.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.020]   You know, just to get my story, you know, heard to,
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.920]   just different people across the, just the nation, bro.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.000]   Like, just trying to reel in people to, you know,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.880]   Jesus Christ, man, you know, like, it's, we in end times,
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.280]   bro, so I know, you know, it's almost, you know,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.100]   rallying up, so.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.940]   - It's almost a wrap.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.120]   - Yeah, so I'm just trying to use my, you know,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.000]   my story, you know, with my gift, and just try to,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.720]   you know, tally in as much people as I can to,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.560]   you know, home to Christ.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.120]   So, that's something that I'm really just,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.360]   you know, taking pride in.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.520]   - Well, you inspire me, bro, like, 'cause you right,
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.040]   I agree with you that this, the time and the age
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.960]   that we're in, and the fact that nowadays,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.720]   good is pretty much looked at as bad,
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.920]   and bad is looked at as good.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.960]   - Good is insane.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.280]   - Bro, I could get on social media,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.720]   and the things that people are, like, glorifying as good,
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.320]   are literally evil, and evil is good.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.000]   And, like, that's what it talks about in the Bible,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.400]   is end times, so, like, even just talking right now,
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.880]   like, you inspire me to wanna, like, help bring people in,
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.080]   and that's why, like, this podcast to me is important,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.280]   because, like, I could have a bad basketball game
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.960]   and not feel like doing a podcast,
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.360]   but if people listen to this podcast,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.800]   and they hear our stories, because we're two people
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.080]   that have been through a lot of adversity,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.720]   like, I should not, like, for me, in my story,
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.200]   I should not even be in the NBA, either.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.760]   Like, yeah, I was the number one player in high school,
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.440]   but after the three back surgeries,
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.040]   and now, you know, coming back from that,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.240]   like, there's guys that are done after one,
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.760]   and there's guys, you know, the brace that I'm wearing,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.320]   like, no one in the history of NBA
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.280]   has even attempted to play in a brace like that,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.360]   and I'm trying to hoop, and it's painful, it's hard,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.960]   like, adversity's hard, but the fact that it inspires
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   someone, like, I feel like our purpose should be
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.840]   to get, like, our story out there
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.620]   to get people to keep going, but like you said,
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.640]   the main thing is bringing people towards Christ,
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.880]   so, like, I think the fact that you shared your story,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.740]   and people get to know you, like,
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.600]   that's the most important thing.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.240]   It's hard to keep that perspective, though, like,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.080]   - Yeah.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.920]   - It's hard to keep that perspective.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.240]   - It really is, but, you know,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.560]   it's something that I just take pride in, bro.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.920]   Like, I really take pride in just trying to,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.000]   you know, reel people in, man, just with my story,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.720]   but, you know, I know this is a podcast
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.560]   where you ask me questions,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.000]   but I know you've just been through a lot, too, bro,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.640]   like, just everything that you've been through.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.240]   You know, even when I was over there in Denver,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.120]   I had seen you, you know, recovering and stuff,
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   you know, before, you know, you had signed your big deal
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.520]   and stuff like that, I'm like, you know,
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.700]   Mike is in here trying to, you know,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.840]   get himself going and get back, but, you know,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.620]   how was that, you know, for you, as far as, like,
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.480]   just trying to, you know, your back injury,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.640]   but on top of that, still, like, you know,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.560]   wearing a brace, you know,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.920]   right before you're about to go to training camp
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.960]   and trying to, like, 'cause you didn't play a season,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.220]   you know, or you didn't play, like, the whole season,
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.720]   'cause the season just started, then it happened,
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.520]   you know, and then just trying to get back out there.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.200]   - Yeah, nobody could tell me that God isn't real, either,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.680]   but, like, when people ask me for, like, a story on why,
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.120]   I say, like, the contract thing,
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.960]   because, yeah, like, I've hooped in this brace or whatever,
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.880]   like, I've hooped and I've done, like, well,
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.160]   like, obviously, I'm still trying to grow,
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.360]   still trying to get better, still trying to heal my body,
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.360]   but I signed that contract right before I had another injury,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.280]   like, and you know in the NBA, like,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.600]   if that injury had come,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.760]   'cause I didn't play that whole season
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.840]   right after I signed the contract,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.660]   and everybody's talking about,
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.920]   "Oh, it's the worst contract in NBA history,"
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.840]   you know, people talking crazy,
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.800]   but if I had gotten hurt maybe three weeks prior,
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.960]   then, boom, that big contract,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.080]   and I think the reason God allowed me to have that contract,
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.360]   and sometimes it's annoying,
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.800]   because sometimes I never even cared
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.000]   to have money like that.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.480]   - Exactly, I'm so the same way, bro, I just hooped, bro.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   - I always wanted to hoop,
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.240]   but now, like, once you sign a big contract,
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.000]   people want you to live up to it,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.280]   and they expect you to be, like, consistent every game,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.040]   not knowing what you're going through off the court,
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.200]   and not knowing what you're,
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.840]   so that has been kind of hard.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.800]   People don't know, like, how everything I've gone through,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.640]   how much--
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.880]   - And you're still trying to overcome that, too, as well,
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.720]   yeah.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.540]   - But, like, I think,
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.600]   no one could tell me that God not real,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.120]   because he allowed me to get that contract,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.560]   because he knew, for me, you have your gifts,
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.720]   one of my gifts is, like, being generous, so.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.560]   - Yeah, yeah, facts.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.680]   - I've been able to use my money,
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.480]   and I'm still trying to think of more ways
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.160]   to use it, like, in a way that God would be happy with.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.320]   I've been able to help my family,
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.160]   been able to do this,
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.080]   and I never was trying to hold it onto myself,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.200]   but the hard part is, like, man, people just,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.440]   it's the people that don't understand.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.320]   We understand it, bro, and it's just, it's annoying,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.920]   because they'd be, like, yo, you signed a big contract,
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.960]   you're supposed to do this, that, this, that,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   and it's, but it's, like, bro, you don't even, like,
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.440]   I didn't even ask for it, but I would've hooped for free.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.600]   You could've given me a, you didn't got,
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.560]   you didn't even have to give me any millions of dollars,
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.400]   and I still would've hooped.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.240]   - Still would've hooped, bro,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.760]   but this is something that they just don't see,
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.560]   and don't understand, bro.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.320]   You know, they looking from the outside in,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   and not really looking at, you know, the inside,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.600]   and really what, you know, we go through on a daily basis,
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.380]   you know, what we're really dealing with, you know,
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.520]   and trying to overcome, still to this day, like,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.200]   nobody know how painful this, you know,
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.520]   still to this day, how that's feeling,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.160]   you know, your back, and your foot.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.360]   They just care about, oh, he need to go out there
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.720]   and perform, he need to da-da-da,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.760]   which they not even understanding.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.120]   You going out there, you sacrificing your body, you know,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.040]   which, you know, some people don't even like to do.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.240]   They sit out the whole season 'til they right.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.080]   - 'Til they feeling perfect.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.320]   - 'Til they feeling perfect, bro.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.400]   So I'm saying, but, like, I salute you for that,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.640]   just going out there, and just, you know,
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.680]   trying to sacrifice your body,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.720]   because I know what you're going through,
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.400]   but, you know, fans that's not paying attention to the game,
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.600]   or not paying attention to you, you know, as a person,
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.040]   they just looking through the TV,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.640]   oh, he missed all these shots, he da-da-da.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.080]   But then, when you're making all these shots,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.680]   they ain't nowhere near to be found,
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.760]   so it's like, what you gonna say now?
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.240]   - Then you the next best, you, it's crazy.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.640]   - Bro, it's pathetic, bro.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   That's why, like, I don't get into all that, bro.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.120]   I just let people just be, oh, bro.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.640]   I don't care, bro, I could care less, bro.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   They fans for a reason, bro.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.320]   - People are so crazy, bro.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.680]   - That's why they called fans, bro.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.480]   - And, like, you made the point earlier,
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.800]   like, you could be the best fan in the world.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.760]   You could literally be, well, I don't really see
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.560]   people talking too crazy about Nicola,
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.840]   'cause he just, well, he don't even be on social media,
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.040]   but, like, I see people talk crazy about every player.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.720]   Giannis, Bron, KD, any player can get talked crazy about,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.760]   so it really is just about, just taking it in stride
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.960]   and dealing with the highs and the lows,
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.920]   like, we, at the end of the day, we're blessed.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.640]   Like, who cares what this person is in their crib,
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   typing on the phone, like, who really is worried
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.480]   about what they're saying?
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.320]   - I don't get into all that.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.840]   I'm not gonna lie, all that just be for clickbait, bro.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.400]   I don't get into all that.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.200]   I just stay in my lane, bro.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.040]   They got it.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.080]   - Right.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.280]   - They got it, bro.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.360]   - I think this has been, like, super inspiring.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.880]   Like, I don't like to keep people on the podcast too long.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.400]   I just, when I get people on here,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.080]   I have specific questions that I wanna ask.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.360]   - Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.840]   - But I think, for me and you, we bond over the fact
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.120]   that we've both been through adversity
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.960]   and come out the other side.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.280]   We're really both not supposed to be here,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.080]   like, after things that we've been through.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.640]   - Yeah.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.680]   - And you inspire me to continue
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   to put my message out there.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.440]   You're very bold with yours, like, on social media.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.760]   And I feel like that's something that you rarely see now,
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.440]   'cause people are so worried about being canceled
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.680]   or they come off too strong.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.000]   You know, the day and age we live in,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.040]   people are so, like, man, people are out there now, bro.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.480]   - Oh, it's bad.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.880]   - If you are one way, like, you can just get,
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.040]   and you've never been someone who cared about this,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.800]   so I'm the same way.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.960]   That's why I do this podcast.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.160]   I wanna say what I feel without,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.120]   I'm not worried about stepping on anybody's toes,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.560]   'cause we never gonna change, like, our opinions.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.960]   So I appreciate you getting on here
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.040]   and saying what you need to say, bro.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.880]   - Yeah, I like this podcast, bro.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.720]   I'm glad you're doing this, man.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.680]   It's something that, you know,
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.000]   'cause a lot of people don't even know,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.880]   like, they just think,
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.560]   oh, we just supposed to just do basketball.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.320]   It's basketball, basketball, basketball, basketball.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.440]   That's not how it goes.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.480]   Because we made it to the league, that's not how it goes.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.320]   - Shut up and dribble, nigga.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.480]   You know what the comment said?
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.280]   Like, shut up and dribble.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.760]   - I want you to say nothing.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.640]   - Me and AG put the parlay clip on there,
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.960]   put the parlay clip about, like, man.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.120]   I asked him, like, bro,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.240]   do you ever trip about the comments
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.760]   of people talking about the parlay
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.960]   and people talking about,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.640]   oh, you messed up their parlay and you lost them money?
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.160]   And we put that on Instagram,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.400]   and I'm expecting people to be like,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.160]   man, like, people shouldn't be on that, whatever.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.560]   I seen the comment, shut up and dribble, nigga.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.760]   I was like, yo, are you kidding me?
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.440]   - Bro, they ruthless, bro, they don't care, bro.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.320]   They really don't care.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.000]   - But I just think we both are just,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.280]   just literally just play basketball.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.360]   Like, we have voices, too.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.040]   Like, we have things that, other than basketball,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.880]   that we're into, you know.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.880]   For you, it's podcasts.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.440]   For me, you know, it's making music and stuff like that.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.400]   Just trying to just, you know,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.520]   let people hear my message through my music.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.920]   But, you know, that's something that, you know,
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.840]   I salute you on, too, man, just starting a podcast
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.640]   and just getting people on here and, like, you know,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.960]   letting them, you know, you're using your platform
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.440]   to, you know, help me get my story out there.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.880]   That's something that I appreciate, too, bro.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.720]   Thank you for having me, for sure.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.240]   - For real, bro, now, real quick,
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.280]   'cause I did want to touch on the music
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.560]   real quick before you dip.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.760]   So, you hoop, but you also do the music on the side.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.240]   Is that something, like, therapeutic to you?
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.760]   Are you trying to get a message out there?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.160]   What is the whole music thing about?
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.000]   'Cause you're actually nice.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.840]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.040]   - Remember I was singing a song, though?
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.360]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.480]   - Yeah, bro, so what's the whole music about?
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.240]   - Oh, man, so, like, you know, back, you know, in 2018,
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.800]   you know, with the tragedy thing that I was telling you
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.320]   about, you know, what happened to me, you know, my family.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.080]   I was on, like, a house arrest, like, bed rest, basically.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.960]   Like, I couldn't, like, leave the house, you know,
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.040]   I was recovering, you know, with my patella tendon.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.480]   I was down for, like, six, seven months, bro.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.600]   And I really couldn't do nothing,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.360]   but I was in a crib with all my boys and shit,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.200]   so I was just chilling.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.360]   But I always had, like, a voice where I can, like,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.320]   you know, sing and, like, harmonize beats
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.160]   and stuff like that.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.720]   And so, I'm like, man, maybe I can give it a shot.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.400]   But, like, my homeboys, they could, like,
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.760]   they really know how to rap.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.360]   So, I'm like, all right, let me try this hook thing.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.680]   I'ma just make the hook, and y'all make the verses,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.240]   and we gon' see where we go from there.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.640]   So, you know, I just start writing hooks down,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.720]   and it just went from there, and a lot of people like,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.800]   man, like, this John Hart.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.880]   Like, we rockin' with this, y'all was flowin', bro.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.300]   But this was, like, 2018, 2019.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.000]   We started doing shows, bro.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.320]   Like, getting paid for shows.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.560]   (laughs)
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.520]   - Like, back at the crib?
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.440]   - Yes, bro, we was going around the whole Wilmington, bro,
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.400]   getting paid for shows, bro.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.800]   We was turning it up, bro.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.520]   Like, yes, bro, we was having a ball.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.880]   I'm in there with the brace on,
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.520]   with the crutches performing.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.840]   (laughs)
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.520]   - Bro, I was going, I ain't gonna lie,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.720]   I had a lot of fun.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.400]   Even though, like, that was a very low moment of my life,
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.840]   like, I really had a lot of fun, though.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.600]   Like, 2018, 2019.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.320]   But that really got me into the music, though, bro.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.680]   Then I dropped a single, and it went crazy.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.520]   - Which one is that again?
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.360]   - It's called, "We Gon' Shine."
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.000]   - What's the one I was singing that one, though?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   - It might be, it might be, is it the new one?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.960]   - Nah, it's the older one, I think.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.040]   I gotta look it up.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.400]   But where do you wanna take the music?
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.000]   You wanna, like, actually, like,
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.760]   this is, like, a real thing you do?
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   - Yeah, 'cause, like, the message that I put in my songs,
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.920]   bro, they're so inspiring to other people,
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.360]   like, you know, what they're going through.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.680]   And they can relate to me through my music.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.520]   So it's like, damn, like, I feel what he's saying.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.520]   You know, just the background, how I came up and stuff.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.120]   You know, what I've been through in my life.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.400]   You know, just putting that all in a song.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.600]   They like, yeah, like, that's something I can listen to.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.360]   You know, 'cause I really don't sound like,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.680]   you know, I sound like a real rapper, bro.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.520]   And they like, yeah.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.640]   (laughs)
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   Like, damn, this music is really gold, bro.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.360]   So I'm like, damn, I'm gonna just keep putting music out.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.200]   I haven't dropped an album for, like, a year.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   They was on my ass about dropping an album.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.720]   - And then you put the thing on the 'Gram,
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.920]   the little clip, and people was going crazy.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.680]   - Yes, bro, the little Discard video that I had dropped.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.400]   But, yeah, they were going crazy over the music, bro.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.240]   They love it, bro.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.400]   So I'm gonna definitely just keep going with it.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.320]   I feel like it's gonna be great worldwide.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.440]   I can't wait 'til so many more people hear my music, bro.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.960]   - Especially when you get back and you're killing
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.680]   on the court like you're going to very soon.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.520]   - Facts.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.360]   - And then you're doing the music on top.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.600]   Bro, keep sharing your message.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   Like, even though your story is so painful,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.320]   like, that is an inspiring story, bro.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.680]   And it's a testimony to God.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.260]   Like, God says, like, your testimony will bring,
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.040]   people's testimony will bring other people to him.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.560]   So that is, you know, you can really do that, bro.

[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.340]   "Damn."

[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.320]   Like, what really made it, like, viral
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.160]   when we played in Philly, bro,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.000]   and all the people came,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.560]   and you know, I had explained my story,
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.520]   but I had dropped, you know, tears, you know,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.040]   in the press conference.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.360]   You know, I couldn't hold it in, bro.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.480]   I just dropped tears, bro,
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.720]   and that really, like, blew up, man.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   A lot of people had caught up to my story,
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.480]   and like, "Damn, this kid is, like, inspiring."
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.680]   Like, it's no way he's still going.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.500]   He's still smiling.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.340]   He's just this joyful kid and shit like that.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.920]   - I can't believe that, bro.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.520]   Like, you literally just-- - Yeah.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.440]   - You literally just was in your room chilling,
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.760]   and then you look out the door,
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.600]   and the flames were just going crazy.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.440]   - Watch, man.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.960]   I've never seen nothing like it in my life, bro.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.680]   Just imagine you open a door, bro,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.160]   and it's like, are you seeing this orange, blue,
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.000]   and, like, red?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.200]   - Isn't that the craziest thing?
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.520]   - That was really, like, some movie shit.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.560]   I watch movies, bro.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.480]   It's like, they got all the time in the world, bro,
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   to, like, just do all this fucking thinking,
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.000]   and it's like, you don't have that time, bro.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.320]   I probably was in that room for, like, three minutes, bro.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.280]   - And then you just was ready to give up and just--
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.720]   - Yeah, bro, I was gonna go, bro.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.960]   I'm not gonna lie. - I can't believe that, bro.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.800]   - I was gonna go.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.520]   Like, the whole room was just cloudy
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.320]   and just full of, like, black smoke just coming in.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.400]   I'm like, "Nah."
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.560]   But, you know, God's voice is so powerful, bro.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.400]   - Bro, you heard it.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.220]   You heard it. - Yes, bro.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.800]   I swear, I was sitting there on my knees, bro,
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.960]   just ready just to go, bro.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.280]   I just was like, "Damn, like, all right.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.600]   "If it's my time, it's my time."
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.560]   Like, you know, I feel like, you know,
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.640]   when God gives his time to people,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.120]   it's like, you know, he's calling them home.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.640]   So I'm like, "All right, it is what it is.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.560]   "Like, I'm just gonna go."
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.680]   But, bro, his voice so powerful, bro.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.200]   I just heard it in my head, bro.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.040]   Just get up.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.860]   I got you.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.700]   Like, just get up.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.160]   - And then the reason your little nephew survived
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.040]   was because your grandma-- - My grandma was--
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.880]   - Hovering over him.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.700]   - Hovered over him. - Yeah.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.720]   - And she's burnt, charcoal, and then he survived.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.400]   - Yep, mm-hmm, right over top, bro.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.280]   - I can't believe, you said he was three weeks old.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.520]   - He was three weeks, yeah.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.200]   - I just can't believe, like, the smoke inhalation.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.040]   - That's the grace of God.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.880]   That was so crazy.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.840]   Like, literally went to the hospital that night.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.640]   Like, my grandma, she didn't, like, say she passed away yet.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.120]   I think it, like, got to her, like, almost the next day,
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.200]   like, the middle of the night, and said she passed.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.320]   But, like, I just kept hearing my, like, my nephew,
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.520]   he's, like, he has a chance to make it.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.360]   Like, he's alive.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.480]   Like, I'm like, "Wow, this is fucking crazy, bro."
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.200]   Like, but they sent up my other baby cousin that passed,
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   but we literally had one more, just, like, just here.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.600]   That's just the grace of God, bro.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.440]   Like, it's just crazy.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.280]   - Wait, who ran in?
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.960]   Was it the ambulance that ran in there and got them,
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.800]   or who was it?
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.200]   - Yeah, yeah, the ambulance ran in there and got them.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.720]   But it, like, I live, like, literally down the street
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   from the fire station.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.640]   They took so long to get there.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.480]   I'm like, bro, like, I swear to God, I can walk down there.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.600]   Like, I'm like, bro, it's literally two blocks away.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.520]   I don't understand what the fuck is taking so long,
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.360]   but they took forever to get there.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   But yeah, when they had walked out and walked them out
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.000]   and on a little stretcher thing, man,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.640]   that shit was, like, really scary to see, dawg.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.720]   But I'm just glad, like, I have, like, you know,
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.840]   you know, Lil Izzy here to, like,
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.400]   'cause he don't really know.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.360]   But, like, he asked me, like, you know,
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   "We survived the fire, dah, dah, dah," like,
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.080]   and he don't really know what he really overcame, though.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.920]   It's just, like, kind of-
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.760]   - He's five now?
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.580]   - Yeah, he's five now.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.520]   Yeah, yeah, he don't really know, though.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.000]   I'm just, like, damn, like,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.320]   he's starting to catch on a little bit.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.960]   So I know eventually, though, he gonna ask me, like,
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.480]   you know, what happened, and, you know,
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.120]   'cause he be like, "Oh, I survived a house fire.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.540]   "I, dah, dah, dah," and I'm like,
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.880]   "Damn, man, how the fuck do you know this?"

[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.280]   But I know eventually, though, he gonna, like,
