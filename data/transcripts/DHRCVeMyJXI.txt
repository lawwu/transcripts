[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   For anyone going to Paris that's never been,
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.760]   getting on the RERB from Paris into the city
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760]   couldn't be easier.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.320]   Riding the Paris subway couldn't be easier.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.120]   Surprisingly less crowded than we were expecting.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480]   We thought Paris was gonna be wild and crazy
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.720]   and there were a lot of people there,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.560]   but it never felt like there were a lot of people there.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.200]   - I think Paris does tourism so well already
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.600]   that accommodating the influx of people there
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.160]   for the Olympics just felt very natural.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.040]   I think it's also a great city to just do walkabouts.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.720]   So we were there for the Olympics,
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.120]   but even if you're there not for the Olympics,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.920]   I think it's just a great city to just put on your shoes
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.440]   and get out there and explore by walking.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.760]   There's so many cool neighborhoods
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.800]   and bars and restaurants and all of that.
