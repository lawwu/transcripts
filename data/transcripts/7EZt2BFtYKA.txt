[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.120]   the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, in chapter 5, reading verses 8, 9, and 10.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.400]   Verses 8, 9, and 10 in the fifth chapter of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:31.040]   Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.400]   that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.520]   In mine ears, said the Lord of hosts, are the truth, many houses shall be desolate,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.680]   even great and fair, without inhabitant.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.360]   Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   an ephah.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.040]   Now, these words come immediately following the first seven verses in this fifth chapter
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.800]   of the prophecy of Isaiah, which we considered together last Sunday evening.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   There, as I tried to show you, the Prophet, as was almost invariably the case with him
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.920]   that was his particular method, and indeed it's a very good method, he always starts
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.600]   out by stating the whole case, and then he proceeds to take it up in particular, and
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   to illustrate what he's already said in general.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.240]   Now, last Sunday night, in looking at those first seven verses, we saw that the Prophet
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.920]   was delivering his message to his contemporaries in the form of a poem, in the form of a picture.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.840]   And through that picture, he conveyed God's message to his contemporaries, the children
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   of Israel.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.640]   He says that in the seventh verse, "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.760]   And he looked for judgment, but behold, oppression for righteousness, but behold, a crime."
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.080]   Now, the message we found in general was this.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   Israel is, after all, but a pattern, an illustration, an example, which God has set before the whole
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   of the human race in order to convey his great message to the whole of mankind.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.320]   God is the God of the whole world.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.680]   He made it all, and everything that's in it, and it all still belongs to him.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.600]   So the message of God to the children of Israel is, in a larger sense, the message of God
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.840]   to the whole of humanity.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.720]   And we saw that the message could be summarized in some such form as this, that man's greatest
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.960]   trouble is due to his ignorance of his own true nature.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.120]   He doesn't realize who he is and what he is, how he has been made by God, and the whole
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.320]   object and purpose of his being.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:20.160]   The second thing we saw was the utter irrationality, unreasonableness of man's rebellion against
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.780]   God and what he does instead of keeping the law of God.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.080]   Instead of being a luscious grape, he is a wild grape.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.480]   Instead of bringing forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes that are useless and bitter
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.080]   and sour, and it's utterly unreasonable.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.600]   Furthermore, we saw that there is an element of perversion in it, that man is no longer
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.720]   straight, he is no longer as God made him, he has become something else.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.080]   His whole nature is vitiated.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   In other words, the problem of the human race is not a superficial problem, it's a very
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.200]   profound problem.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.360]   What's wrong with all of us by nature is not something on the surface, it's something
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.320]   down in the very character and essence of our being.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:20.480]   Wild grapes instead of the choicest grapes growing from the choicest vine which God originally
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.680]   made and planted.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   And lastly, we saw that man in all this is utterly inexcusable, that God, even God has
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   exhausted everything that he could do for us.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.760]   He puts it in these plaintive words, "What could have been done more to my vineyard that
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.200]   I have not done in it?"
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.160]   What more could God have done than he's done by sending his only Son into the world and
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.920]   even to the death of the cross?
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   Man is utterly inexcusable.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   There's only one hope for him, and that is that he should realize it ere it is too late
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.320]   and repent and turn back to God, lest the wrath of God descend upon him.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.800]   Now then, there's the great picture, there it is all as it were in an action.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.340]   But now having done that, the Prophet goes on.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.000]   And he goes on now to give us particular examples and illustrations of what he's thus stated
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.280]   by putting his case in general.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:33.600]   Now somebody may very well ask the question, "Are these particulars necessary?
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Is there any need for us to bother our heads about them at all?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.840]   Isn't it enough that we should have that general picture, that general message?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.400]   Why did the Prophet proceed to put these particulars in terms of six woes?
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.240]   Why wasn't he content with just delivering his general message?"
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.160]   Now there are many people who hold that view at the present time.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.320]   They say they like a general message, but they object to these particulars.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.800]   You know it's the same objection that people have to a personal gospel.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.480]   There are many people who have no objection to the gospel at all, as long as it remains
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.600]   in the realms of general ideas and generalities.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.120]   But the moment it becomes personal, the moment it's applied, the moment it begins to put
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.720]   a pressure upon us and to call upon us to do something, they object to it.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   They dislike it.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.440]   They say this is abominable, it's an impertinence.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.560]   I'm interested in ideas, but I don't like this personal element.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.200]   Now that's the same objection as the objection that many people have to the particulars,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.160]   which the Bible nevertheless always puts before us.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.400]   The Bible never stops at generalities.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.920]   It always brings it down to the particular.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.800]   Why does it do this?
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.680]   I think this is a very important question.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.240]   Well, it does it, I say, very largely for that reason I've just been giving.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:16.560]   It does it in order to bring the truth right home to us and to produce a real conviction.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.800]   Now I could illustrate this to you in many, many different ways.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.400]   Whether I've ever used this illustration before or not, I don't know.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.240]   But at any rate, it does illustrate the point so well that I'm going to utter it once more.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.640]   I want to show you that the general is not enough, that we must come down to particulars.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.520]   On the instance, the illustration that comes to me is this.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.640]   I remember once hearing a very eloquent statesman delivering a great oration.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.840]   The theme was "the sanctity of international contracts."
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:02.260]   The theme obviously was the importance of a bond, of a solemn word, the sanctity of
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.840]   international contracts.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   Here was a great principle.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.400]   The statesman was then fighting in the First World War and fighting for this great, grand
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   principle.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.880]   And while the man was able to speak so eloquently on the general principle, he was not being
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.680]   loyal to his own marriage contract.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.280]   See, it's very well to get excited about the sanctity of international contracts.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.880]   You talk about general ideas and great principles.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:38.800]   But my dear friend, the question is, do you really believe in the sanctity of contracts?
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.160]   The way you discover that is by not discussing general principles and ideas, but by examining
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.640]   your own life.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.920]   Are you actually observing contracts, in that case the marriage contract, in your own personal
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.640]   life and conduct?
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.400]   Now, that's one of the reasons for always bringing the general down to the particular.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.920]   It brings it home to us.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.280]   It's all right to sit down and say, "Yes, that's a fine principle."
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.640]   But are we really in agreement?
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.360]   We've got to examine ourselves.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.320]   The particular will make us do that.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:19.440]   Secondly, particulars, after all, are but illustrations of the general.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.720]   They belong to the general.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.440]   That is, the relationship of particular and general, the particular is a particular of
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.280]   the general, and therefore it's a very good way of illustrating it.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.600]   And as I say, we're all helped by illustrations.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.480]   We don't always see a principle until an illustration is used.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.280]   "Ah," we say, "now I've got it.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.360]   I couldn't quite get it as a principle, but now, as you put it in a concrete instance
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.060]   like that, I see exactly what you're talking about."
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.920]   That is the value of all pictures and of illustrations.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.160]   It is the particular illustrating the general.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:01.680]   So it helps us still more to understand that general and to make certain that we do indeed
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.280]   grasp it.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   But there is a third value in these particulars, and this is the one that I am particularly
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.760]   interested in as we look at this first illustration tonight, and as I hope to look at the others
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.440]   following with you, God willing, and it is this.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.080]   The particulars, as we have them here, if they did nothing else, they do this.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:36.880]   They show us that in spite of the passage of the centuries, man still remains what he
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.440]   has always been.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.840]   The particulars—you see, if I make a statement, "Man doesn't change.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.680]   Man essentially remains absolutely what he's always been," somebody may take it up and
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   say, "Oh, that's all right.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.280]   It's all very well to make a statement like that, but how do you prove to us that man
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.560]   is still what he's always been?"
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   My answer is this, that I find that some 2,800 years ago, the prophet Isaiah picks out some
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:14.800]   six glaring things that were wrong in the life of his nation, in the life of men in
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   sin and out of the knowledge of God, and I'm afraid it's going to be but too easy a task
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   for me to show you that these are the main problems confronting Great Britain and every
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.480]   other civilized nation in the world tonight, indeed every uncivilized nation also.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:47.400]   The particulars help us to see, in a way that nothing else can, that sin is still sin and
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:59.640]   that man is still man, exactly as he has been through all his known and recorded history.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.920]   Very well.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.200]   In other words, I'm going to show you that the characteristics of life then are still
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.720]   the characteristics of life now.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.040]   Now then, they are put here, I say, in the form of these woes.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.080]   "Woe unto them," says the prophet.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   He's delivered his general verdict, he's now going to put it in particulars.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.600]   Why is God concerned?
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.680]   Why is God going to punish the nation of Israel?
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.120]   "Well, if you're in any doubt," says the prophet, "I'll tell you in detail.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.880]   It's because you're guilty of this and this and this and this and this and that."
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.480]   Here are your particulars justifying the general verdict of wrath and of condemnation.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.680]   Now then, we're looking at the first tonight.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.040]   "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.120]   place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth."
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.920]   "In mine ear," said the Lord of hosts, "of a truth many houses shall be desolate,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.080]   even great and fair, without inhabitant."
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:09.280]   "Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath."
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:16.320]   Your ten acres will only give you that which is just something like a thimble full, looked
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.520]   at in terms of comparison.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:26.160]   "And the seed of an homer, instead of giving an abundant crop, shall yield only an ephah."
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.120]   Now then, what's the meaning of this?
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.040]   What is the prophet castigating here?
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.080]   On what is God pronouncing this first woe?
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:44.600]   And the answer is materialism, worldliness.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.960]   Now in that ancient civilization, of course, it was mainly a matter of houses and of fields.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.400]   That was the kind of life they lived.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.200]   It was an agricultural community in the main.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.120]   Israel was an agricultural community.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.920]   So these points are put in the Old Testament imagery, naturally, in terms of houses and
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.840]   in terms of fields and animals.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.800]   But the principle is the thing that matters, and the charge that God is bringing here against
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.880]   the nation through the prophet is what we now call materialism, worldliness.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:26.560]   Now, you see what I meant just now when I said that if this does nothing else, it shows
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.960]   us that man remains what he's always been, that sin remains what it's always been,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.800]   that there's no change whatsoever.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.840]   There is nothing that is so blind as that a man should say, "Oh, well, you know, I
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.600]   don't see what the Old Testament's got to do with me."
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   Don't you?
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.920]   I hope I'll show you tonight that it's got everything to do with you.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:56.960]   Because you, my friend, though you are alive in 1964, are exactly what man was 800 years
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.000]   before the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.980]   The main problem there, the first degenerate, was materialism.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.680]   What is it tonight?
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.000]   Materialism.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.440]   Worldliness.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.800]   It is still exactly the same thing.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:18.440]   Of course, to most of us here in London, well, let's be careful, perhaps it is houses, but
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.360]   it isn't fields, is it?
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.400]   Our type of life has changed, but that's merely a superficial change.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.960]   We think now in terms of money and what money can buy, possessions, goods, everything that
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.440]   becomes ours as the result of money.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:41.000]   And here, I say, is the very essence of the modern problem.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.520]   Christianity is at a great discount in this country.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.960]   People are not interested in it.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   Only 10% claim any interest in it.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:56.760]   And half those, well, have a very doubtful interest in it, to say the very least.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   What's the matter?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   What's the matter with the 90, 95%?
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.280]   Why are they not interested in Christianity?
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.680]   The answer is because they're materialists, because they're interested in this other thing.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.160]   See, as the children of Israel turned away from God, so men have turned away from God
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:21.640]   in this century, and they're interested in materialism, possessions, goods, things, everything
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.320]   that results from the possession of money.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:31.640]   And of course, everything in the world is encouraging men and women to do this.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:38.600]   This is a year of a general election, and the parties are beginning to get ready.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.880]   I'm not very interested, and I'll tell you why.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.040]   Because all the parties are encouraging this self-same thing.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.080]   Of course, they do it to get votes, to buy votes, and they know their constituents very
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.000]   well indeed.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.560]   And they know the man who promises the most is the man who's likely to get the vote.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.240]   You don't need to be a profound psychologist to know that, but the politicians do know
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.640]   that, and so they will compete with one another in offering more and more, and saying that
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.520]   their offer's better than the other one.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.080]   And they'll all say the same things.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:19.600]   I'm convicting all of them of the same thing, namely that they're encouraging a spirit of
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.480]   materialism in men and women, that they're very little interested in principles, any
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   of them.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.000]   Now, that doesn't say that we shouldn't have politics.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.840]   You've got to govern your country.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.520]   But oh, that we had politics which was concerned about truth, and about principles, about morality
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:43.640]   and living, and not merely pandering to the lusts and the desires of men and women.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.000]   Something for nothing.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.200]   The politicians are all encouraging this.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.480]   So are the newspapers, perhaps even more.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.120]   That's why they're one of the worst influences in the world tonight.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:06.880]   Giving the impression always that that's the real life, the life of money and of possessions.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.920]   Encouraging it in every way, almost.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.840]   Always holding it before us and parading it.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.200]   You get exactly the same in all these other great media of communication, television,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.560]   radio, and all the rest of them.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.440]   The whole world, you see, is preaching materialism.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.480]   It's not interested in the spiritual.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.000]   But it's telling us to concentrate on this life and this world.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.600]   It thinks it's clever in talking about pie in the sky.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.280]   The practical men, hard-headed men.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.760]   No, no, that's not his trouble.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.880]   It's that he's soft, that he doesn't think, that he doesn't know how to reason.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.680]   Let me prove my contention to you.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.960]   A woe is pronounced upon this.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   Why?
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.280]   Well, look at the characteristics of such an outlook.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.640]   Let's examine it as it's revealed to us here.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:02.880]   Here is the thing in which men burst today, this materialistic outlook.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.360]   What are its characteristics?
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:10.560]   Well, the first thing we must note about it is its smallness.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.080]   Its smallness.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.760]   What a little life it is.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.240]   Fancy identifying life with a number of houses or a number of fields.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.320]   But you see, that's what people do.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.840]   By doing this, they're expressing their philosophy of life.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   They're expressing their view of themselves.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.880]   That is to be a man, to possess more.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.240]   Now, we've got a great illustration of this, and I hold it before you because it is the
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.960]   last word on this very subject.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.720]   You'll find it in the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:53.080]   Our Lord was preaching one afternoon, and preaching one of the most mystical sermons
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.480]   that he ever preached about the relationship of man to God.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:03.320]   He was talking about time and talking about eternity, and warning men and women not to
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   deny him amongst men, but ever to be true to him, and warning them against the blasphemy
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.220]   against the Holy Ghost.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.960]   Those were the things he was talking about.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.400]   But this is what I read in Luke 12, 13.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.560]   And one of the company said unto him, you see, the moment our Lord stops, as it were,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.080]   to take his breath, a man blurts out and says, one of the company said unto him, "Master,
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:33.200]   speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me."
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:43.360]   And he, our Lord, said unto the men, "Men, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.880]   And then he said unto them, he turned to the whole company, and he said, "Take heed, and
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.680]   beware of covetousness.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:21:00.960]   For a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.840]   Why did our Lord speak like that?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.520]   Well, you see, the answer is perfectly obvious.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.560]   Here is our Lord speaking about ultimate matters, about the highest mysteries and wonders of
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.560]   life and eternity.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.680]   And here is a man in the congregation looking into the face of the Son of God, but he is
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.880]   really not listening to him at all.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   Why?
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.480]   Oh, because to him it isn't your relationship to God and heaven and the soul and the Holy
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.120]   Spirit that matters, but some inheritance.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.600]   There was a dispute between him and his brother about a bit of ground or about some houses.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.560]   So the moment our Lord stops, he blurts out his question, "Speak to my brother that he
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.160]   divide the inheritance with me."
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.760]   And our Lord turns upon him and says, "Men, who made me a judge or a divider amongst you?"
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.440]   He says, "Do you think I've left the courts of heaven and come into this world and am
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.340]   enduring all that I'm enduring in order to settle some little problem like that of dividing
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.960]   an inheritance, some little dispute about property and money?
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.600]   And do you think that I've come from heaven to do that?"
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.800]   Then he turns to the whole congregation and he says, "Take heed and beware of covetousness."
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   Why?
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:20.760]   Well, he says, "A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things that he possesseth,
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.620]   but that is the view of life which is taken by this kind of person.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.620]   What makes a man a man?
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.200]   Well, the number of houses he's got, the number of fields, the amount of money he's got in
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.600]   the bank, the things he can buy, the goods, the gadgets.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.760]   We call them status symbols today, don't we?
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.160]   But it's the same thing.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.760]   That's what makes a man a man, and that's what makes you great.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.000]   You've got more of the status symbols than somebody else, the things that you buy with
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   money.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.280]   Oh, what a conception of life!
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.520]   What a conception of man!
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:23:01.960]   The thing is so small, it's so abysmally small, that a nature, a man, a man's life, a man's
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:12.760]   being and existence, reduced to things that can be bought with money.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.960]   I say again that if I had no other reason for being a Christian, this is enough for
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.960]   me.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:25.920]   That non-Christian view of life, it makes man such a small creature.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:33.280]   It estimates him and judges him in terms of goods and possessions and things that he possesses,
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:39.200]   and knows nothing about his soul and his spirit, and the thing that links him to God and the
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.320]   possibilities of eternity.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.120]   It knows nothing about it.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.940]   It is so small, it's an insult to human nature.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.720]   But not only that, it's utterly debased.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.400]   Our Lord again has put this so perfectly.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.000]   He says, "Where your treasure is there will your heart be also."
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.080]   You see, you have to deal with the same problem.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   What shall we eat?
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   What shall we drink?
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.600]   He says, "These are the things that the Gentiles are concerned about."
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.360]   He says, "Don't you be interested in those things.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.280]   That's what the ungodly are interested in."
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.160]   And they are, of course, and they always have been.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.680]   That's what makes life to them.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   And so the competition goes on.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:29.280]   My dress, the other woman's dress, my house, his house, the number of them, the fields,
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.440]   the car, and all these other things, status symbols.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   This is life.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.760]   And people can't sleep at night because of this.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.180]   The worry, the anxiety, the jealousy, and the envy, and all the rivalry and quarrelling.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.180]   What is man?
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   What is life?
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.840]   Oh, status symbols.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.320]   Number of things that he possesses.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.480]   That's the view which is taken of life, and I say it's ultimately so debased.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.760]   You see, the heart is there that men, well, that men should be concerned about these things.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760]   It's all right.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.680]   There's nothing wrong in possessing things in and of themselves.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.240]   The Bible isn't unreasonable.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.440]   There are things which are necessary, and the Bible doesn't prohibit them.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.920]   But when you set your heart on them, when you identify yourself with them, and when
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.480]   you can't live without them, then you're a slave, says the Bible.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.720]   You're not a man, you're a slave.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:28.200]   Men can possess things, but when he is possessed by the things, that is nothing but sheer slavery.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:35.320]   And a man's heart is taken up with these things, and I say it is utterly debasing.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:42.160]   Our Lord says about this, look here, he says, "The life is more than the raiment."
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.360]   The life is the thing that matters.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:50.200]   The soul, not the clothing, not the food, not the houses, not the fields, not the possessions.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.440]   You see, that's in it.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.120]   It's small and it's debased, but look at this horrible greed that comes out here.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.200]   "Woe unto them that join house to house, lay field to field, till there be no place
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:08.000]   that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth."
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.760]   It's a lust, of course, and it's nothing but a lust.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.260]   And once you get involved in this, you'll never be satisfied.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.840]   That is the meaning of lust, it's an inordinate affection.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.800]   An affection is all right, but when it becomes inordinate, it's all wrong.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.000]   A desire is all right, but a lust is terrible.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.160]   It means that you're governed and controlled by it, and you'll never have enough.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.240]   And here it is, it's typical of these people.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.920]   The modern world is full of this.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.800]   But I must emphasize this one particular aspect of its selfishness.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.260]   "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:55.440]   place," listen, "that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth."
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.440]   Nobody else to be seen.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.040]   I've bought up all the houses, or at least I've got them somehow, and I've got all
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.280]   the fields, and I'm alone in the middle of it all, and I own so much that I can't
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:11.200]   see anybody else, and I'm at last hoping to get satisfaction for myself.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.480]   The utter selfishness of it all.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.040]   Nobody counts but I myself.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.120]   Now, that's why I read to you at the beginning that story of Nebert's vineyard.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.240]   He'd got great possessions of vineyards.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.200]   He has a—Ahab the king had great possessions of vineyards.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   He has a little man.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.160]   He's only got one vineyard.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   His name is Naboth.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.400]   It's come down in the family.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.800]   He isn't a great possessor.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.080]   He's just got this one vineyard.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.120]   The king wants this because it's near his, and he wants to turn it into a garden of herbs,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.240]   the man's living and livelihood, where his fathers and grandfathers and all his forefathers
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   have lived.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:53.600]   The king wants this because Naboth quite justifiably is not prepared either to sell it to him or
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.080]   take anything else for it because this is his home after all, and he has a right to
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.320]   it and he's always lived there.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.680]   The king can't sleep.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.440]   He can't eat his food.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.200]   He's miserable and unhappy and turns his face to the wall like a baby, and then comes that
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.320]   subtle woman Jezebel and says, "It's all right.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   Be a man.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   Aren't you governing?
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.560]   I'll soon get that for you," and remember what she did.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.760]   She encompassed the murder of this innocent poor man Naboth, and they thought all was
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   wonderful.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.760]   Naboth's dead.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.040]   Go and possess your vineyard, and they went into the vineyard.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.880]   Read that story when you go home.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:37.440]   One king's 21, and listen to the verdict of God upon it all, and it was literally fulfilled.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.040]   The terrible end of both Ahab the king and the still more terrible end of Jezebel, that
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.600]   scheming vicious woman.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.080]   That's the story, but look at the selfishness involved.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.280]   Not considering anybody but himself.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.160]   Who's Naboth?
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.680]   What's the matter about his personal feelings?
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   What's the matter?
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.640]   Why does his family pride count?
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.480]   Nothing counts but my family pride, my bigness.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.520]   Who is he?
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.720]   What right has he to refuse?
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.440]   Take it.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.760]   Now I don't want to keep you, my dear friends, but you know this is the whole trouble in
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.920]   the world tonight.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.960]   That's what makes a Hitler.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.720]   That's exactly what was the trouble with Hitler.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.680]   He called it Liebentraum.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.800]   This great nation must have more room to expend, and he'd have been satisfied with nothing
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   less than the world.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.920]   All your world conquerors, so-called, men who try to be are animated by this self-same
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.440]   spirit, thinking of nobody but themselves.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.520]   They want to be alone.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.440]   It's not only true of tyrants like this.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.200]   It's true of the individual.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.360]   Isn't this the main cause of these industrial disputes at the present time?
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.880]   Can they be justified?
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.480]   There was a time when they were more than justified, when men were not given a decent
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   living wage.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.520]   I lived through that period in the 1930s.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.780]   I began my ministry immediately after the general strike and the six-month cold strike
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.320]   of 1926, and I saw men and women and children on the verge of starvation.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.920]   It was a scandal, but it's no longer a scandal.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.960]   Men who are well paid come out on strike.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   Why?
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   Status symbols again, you see.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.480]   Though they're being well paid, somebody's being paid more.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.600]   Why shouldn't I have it?
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.880]   And so you may risk the whole future industrially of your nation.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.480]   What's the nation matter?
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.600]   It's I that matter, and that's the principle, the spirit that you have not only amongst
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.360]   the working classes but also amongst the employers.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.240]   It's true on both sides.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.760]   It's true all round.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.320]   Everybody's out for himself.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.840]   We are all defending by nature personal interests, and it's all nothing but a manifestation of
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.200]   sheer selfishness.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.760]   What do other people's feelings matter?
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.800]   What do the feelings of a wife and children matter if a man's lust is to be satisfied?
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.920]   Or what do the feelings of a husband and children matter if a wife's lusts are to be satisfied?
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.400]   Hence the trouble and the heartbreak and the problem of life today, this selfish spirit
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.680]   that comes in, and it's an expression of this godless materialistic outlook upon the
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   whole of life.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.120]   If they think they can get a better time with another man, well, they can be bought.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.160]   Wives can be bought by men with money, and they leave a house full of children in order
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.640]   to have the supposed good time that money can buy.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   Materialism.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.600]   And it's all utterly selfish.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.040]   But let me come to something more important.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.240]   There is the prophet's analysis of it, but what's the real cause of it?
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   What leads to this?
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.160]   And the answer is quite simple.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:53.040]   "In mine ears," says the prophet, "said the Lord of hosts."
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.080]   The prophet sees how wrong this is.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.320]   How does he come to see that it's wrong?
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.000]   "Oh, God has whispered into his ear.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.440]   In mine ears saith the Lord of hosts.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.200]   God has spoken, and he's heard, he believes that he sees it's right, so he sends on the
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   message."
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:17.040]   But you see, the trouble with the other person is that he forgets God.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.080]   God is not in all his thoughts.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.640]   That is the essence of the modern man's problem, and it leads to all his dilemmas and all his
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   unhappinesses.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.400]   Man has forgotten God.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.080]   That's what's wrong.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.040]   You see, many men think that they're putting into practice Christian principles that won't
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.880]   help you at all if you've forgotten God.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.680]   A man can take up the Sermon on the Mount as a kind of philosophy and say, "Now we
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.040]   must try and persuade both sides of industry and so on to apply this."
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   It's no good.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:57.600]   If man doesn't remember God, principles are of no value.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.800]   Man regards himself as some sort of autonomous being.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.000]   He thinks he's the center of life.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.040]   The moment you turn your back on God, you make yourself a God.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.760]   Man is the center of life, he's the center of the universe, he is the determiner of his
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:19.040]   own fate, he is his own ruler, and he decides what is right and what is wrong.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.760]   That is what is happening in the world at the present time.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.360]   You see, that was man's original sin.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.080]   As I was showing you last Sunday night, he was put into this world by God, he was put
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.160]   into paradise.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.760]   The devil came and said, "Hath God said?
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   Quite right," says man.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.640]   "What right has he to say, 'Turn your back on God'?
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.320]   We will decide."
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:50.120]   And so all troubles entered into the life of man.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:59.920]   The original sin was the sin of forgetting God and turning their backs upon him.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.200]   And hence all the troubles.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:13.840]   "In mine ear saith the Lord of hosts"—and this is the message to the world tonight from
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.720]   this book and from God.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:25.160]   "God, my dear friend, is still over all."
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.440]   The world is his, it's still in his hands, and our times are entirely and altogether
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.280]   in his hands.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.980]   You see, these children of Israel, they turned their backs on God, they went on living as
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.360]   if there wasn't a God.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:45.080]   But you see, that makes no difference whatsoever to God, not the slightest.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.000]   God is and God remains and God is over all.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:00.200]   And the world is still his, and there he is looking down upon it all, and he is speaking.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:06.560]   And what he tells us is this, that as the world is his, the most important thing for
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.840]   us is to know something about him.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:15.720]   For we'll never know ourselves until we know something about God.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.080]   Man only knows himself when he realizes he's made by God and in the image of God.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.760]   And God has revealed his character.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   What is it?
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:31.480]   Well, he is holy, he is just, he is righteous, he is a God of equity, he is a God of fairness.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.000]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.240]   And as he is the maker and the controller of the world, he is the judge of the world.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.640]   Now here is the message, you see.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.200]   Man goes on living as if there were no God.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.440]   He insults himself and his own nature, he debases himself, he perverts himself, he makes
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.240]   himself a contemptible creature.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.120]   And that's the whole time God's looking down upon it, and not only does man get his
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.440]   own troubles and make his own troubles, God is in his wrath looking down upon it.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:17.320]   And remember, "In mine ears saith the Lord of hosts, the Lord of the hosts of heaven,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:25.080]   the Lord and Master of all those great angelic beings and powers and principalities, the
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:32.200]   Lord who is omnipotent, to whose power there is no limit whatsoever, the Lord who is absolute
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:37.280]   and who reigns and rules over all, the Lord reigneth, let the people tremble."
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.560]   That's his message, that's his announcement.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.640]   He is a Lord of illimitable power and authority and control.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:54.080]   There is nothing that he cannot do, and he has declared his will.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.480]   God has declared throughout the running centuries that all this life of materialism and smallness
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:08.400]   and selfishness and greed and lust is abomination in his sight.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:15.400]   He said more, "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.520]   You'll find that statement twice over in this prophecy of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:26.040]   And I feel that this is the word that this generation needs amongst all the others, and
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.200]   most of all amongst all others.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.040]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.160]   It doesn't matter how clever you are, it doesn't matter how able, it doesn't matter
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   how wealthy.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.200]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.640]   If you're wicked, you won't have peace.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.940]   You can add house to house and field to field.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.400]   You can imitate Ahab and Jezebel.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.120]   You'll get no peace.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.080]   God has pronounced this from the very beginning.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.320]   Now then, I want to take you a step further.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:09.640]   God has not only pronounced all this, God has acted according to his pronouncement.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.440]   And the world tonight is not only guilty of God, guilty of forgetfulness of God, it is
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.760]   equally guilty of forgetfulness of history.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.040]   When will we learn from history, my friends?
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.780]   There's a great history of this world behind us.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.880]   Have a look at it, examine it, try and learn from it.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.240]   I know that it's a futile thing for me to tell you to do that.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.600]   For I've quoted you before the dictum of that great German philosopher, Hegel, who
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:43.720]   wasn't a Christian, but he said this, "History teaches us that history teaches us nothing."
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.760]   You would have thought that the war of 1914, 1918 would have taught us something.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.160]   It taught us nothing.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.960]   Has the last war taught us anything?
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.560]   It doesn't look like it, does it?
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.120]   History teaches us that history teaches us nothing.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.520]   Man is ignorant of history, for if he were not ignorant of history, he'd be behaving
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.000]   in a very different manner.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.480]   "Woe saith the Lord, woe unto them, saith this Lord of hosts."
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.200]   And that's what he's been saying from the beginning.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.680]   That's what he said, you know, before the flood.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.880]   The generation of people before the flood had turned their backs upon God.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.800]   You remember how they were living?
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.560]   The Lord has told us, "As they were," he says, "in the days of Noah, they were
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:38.240]   eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, planting and sowing, until the flood
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:44.560]   came and washed them all away."
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.120]   The whole trouble of the generation before the flood was just materialism.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   God didn't matter.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.200]   They turned their backs upon God.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.720]   They could live a better life.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.560]   And so instead of worshipping God and being led by him, they were eating and drinking,
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.840]   marrying and giving in marriage, exactly as they are today.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.200]   They hadn't got newspapers then, and you couldn't get the photographs of the film
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.360]   stars of those days on your front pages.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.080]   But everybody was talking about it, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   This man's committed adultery.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.200]   He's gone away with another woman.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:22.240]   The world was full of that sort of thing before the flood, and God said, "This is abomination."
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.880]   All the imaginations of the thoughts of man's heart are only evil continually, and he said,
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   "I will destroy it," and he did.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.500]   That's history.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:39.000]   Exactly the same in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.400]   You have precisely the same conditions there.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   They needn't keep you.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.240]   The very name Sodom tells you all about that, doesn't it?
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.760]   And London is Sodom, and high society and low society are living in Sodom today.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.640]   Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.080]   The life of the cities of the plain.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.640]   Materialism, wonderful life.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   Lot chose it, you see, thinking he was clever, leaving his uncle Abraham to have the mountain
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.920]   tops for his sheep.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.600]   Life of the cities.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.480]   Society, civilization, wonderful.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.160]   Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.440]   God said what he thought about it, and he carried out what he said.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:27.680]   I've reminded you of the end of this man, Ahab, king of Israel, and his wife Jezebel.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   She was actually eaten by dogs, and her skull was broken.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.000]   A horrible end to both the husband and the wife.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.760]   You know, this is the great story that is unfolded in the Bible.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.880]   Great nations arise, Assyria, Babylon.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.360]   They don't believe in God, they believe in themselves and in their wealth and power.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.320]   And God gets up, having allowed them to go to a certain point, and blows upon them, and
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   they've gone.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.440]   Babylon, Greece, where are they?
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.960]   Egypt, it was once one of the greatest nations in the world, with the most astounding civilization.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.200]   Look at it now, and look at it as it's been for centuries.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.640]   Rome, where is her greatness?
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   Greece.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.400]   Look at these great empires.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:16.200]   Every attempt at world domination has always ended in the same way.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.840]   It's all epitomized so perfectly in that man who, speaking naturally, was such a great
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.360]   man, the emperor Napoleon, who went out to conquer the world.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.800]   And where did he end?
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.480]   Confined to a little island in the South Atlantic.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.880]   How different is the result from the dream?
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.760]   How different is the end product from the ambition?
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.200]   No, no, God has said this and God has done this.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.520]   And you know, my dear friends, he's still saying this, and this is his message tonight.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.680]   God is going to punish this materialistic age.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.040]   He's already doing so.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040]   How does he do it?
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:55.080]   Well, he tells us here, he turns it all to desolation.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.920]   Man says, "I'm going to join house to house and lay field to field, till there be no place
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.520]   that there may be placed alone in the midst of the earth."
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.320]   And my dear, saith the Lord of hosts, "Oh, the truth, tell them this.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.800]   Many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitants.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.400]   Your great houses will be ruins.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.280]   There'll be no men and women there.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.520]   The animals will be there, and the ivy will be there, and the moss will be there, and
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.080]   the rust will be there.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   Desolation."
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.000]   And God's going to do it.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.320]   God won't allow this.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.160]   Now there's a very extraordinary statement of all this in the 45th chapter of this prophet
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.120]   Isaiah in the 7th verse.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   Have you ever considered the meaning of this?
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.440]   Let me read it to you.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.000]   "I form the light and create darkness.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.320]   I make peace and create evil.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.280]   I, the Lord, do all these things."
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.440]   What's he mean by saying he creates evil?
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.520]   What he means is this.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:58.800]   Not that he creates wrong, but that he does bring to pass the evil consequences of men's
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   sin.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.880]   God says, "You gather your fields, you gather your houses.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.400]   I will turn them into desolation."
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.640]   When men sinned, God cursed the earth.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.920]   And in spite of all men's frantic endeavors and brilliant organization ever since in all
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:26.480]   his vaunted civilizations, he can't get rid of the curse, the thorns and the briars, the
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.000]   moth and the rust.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.160]   So our Lord says, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust doth
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.960]   corrupt and where thieves break through and steal.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.120]   That is life in this world.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.440]   You do what you like.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   You can't stop it.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.760]   The moth, the rust.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.720]   None observed will suddenly be doing its own insidious work and what you've built up
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   will be made desolate because God has cursed the earth and manifests his judgment in this
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.720]   way."
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.480]   Now, I want in a very brief word to show you the terribly important relevance of all this
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:05.320]   to this century in which you and I live and into which we belong.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.200]   We are living in an age, my dear friends, when we are seeing the dissolution of things
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.720]   that people thought were eternal.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.760]   Sir Winston Churchill said during the war that he had not been called to office to preside
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:26.680]   at the dismemberment of the British Empire, but he actually did that, you know.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.120]   Who would have thought a hundred years ago that what has happened by now would have been
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.280]   true?
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.280]   What's happened to India and these countries in Africa?
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.400]   People who believed in the British Empire.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.080]   What do they say now?
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.160]   We've seen the whole world being turned upside down.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.560]   We've seen the loss of accumulated wealth.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.920]   The richest nation in the world has become one of the poor ones.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.240]   You can't play fast and loose with these things.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   God is over all.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   The Lord of hosts.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.600]   He's still reigning.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.720]   You plan, you scheme, you go on without him and you put your faith in these things and
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.480]   give your heart to these things.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.960]   You'll find you'll have nothing but desolation.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:12.400]   Now there are some terrible examples of this at the present time.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.240]   Do you know one of the greatest fears and anxieties of some of the leading scientists
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.400]   in the world at this moment?
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.280]   Do you know what it is?
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.040]   It is the fear of famine.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.480]   It is the fear of starvation.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.520]   Now I'm not saying this.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.600]   Some of the acutest observers who are not Christians, they're terrified at the prospect
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.960]   of famine and starvation.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   Why?
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   Well there are two main reasons.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.160]   One is the amazing phenomenal increase in the world population.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.760]   The number of mouths to be fed.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.200]   But the other side is the lack of food.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.240]   Why is there a lack of food?
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.880]   You see this is where the principle comes in.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:59.760]   You know one of the greatest causes of trouble will be what is called soil erosion.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.160]   What's soil erosion?
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:07.520]   Well you hear about the sand bowls in America and in parts of Canada.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   What are these sand bowls?
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   I'll tell you.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.440]   Men went there you see and there was this soil, this virgin soil.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.400]   Now then they said wonderful, we want to make a fortune.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.280]   So we'll take crop after crop after crop out of this soil.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.200]   We'll put nothing in, no manure, nothing.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   This is virgin soil.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.560]   We'll get out all we want.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.520]   It'll last in our lifetime.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.480]   And they cut down all the trees which are the natural protection and the source of moisture.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   They got rid of them all, the more land the better.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.560]   Pull up the trunks, sow, have your great farms, your wonderful acres.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.560]   Get all you can out of it.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.800]   And they've got all they can out of it.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.760]   And there's nothing left but sand, sand bowls.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:50.560]   Soil erosion is the result of the destruction of your great forests, which is nature's way
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.000]   of preserving these things.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.080]   And so you see that in this wonderful 20th century when man has come to his own and when
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:05.960]   scientific knowledge has advanced so far, our greatest problem is likely to be starvation.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   Lack of food.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960]   Isn't it ironical?
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:13.520]   Yes, but it's just a fulfillment of the biblical message.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.380]   You gather land and field to field without God and you'll find that your wonderful fields
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.380]   will come to this.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:24.080]   Ten acres of vineyard shall yield just one bath.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.520]   Ridiculous.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:31.000]   And the seed of an homer, instead of multiplying itself almost endlessly, shall yield just
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   a leaf.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.560]   You'll sow great quantities, but your soil is so hopeless because it's become desolate
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.980]   that it'll give you nothing.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.240]   These things come back, don't they?
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.120]   They don't work out as we think that they're going to.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:48.560]   And of course we are seeing this great thing perhaps more clearly than anywhere at the
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.440]   present time in the United States of America.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.120]   What's the greatest problem in the United States today?
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.000]   Well, it's the color problem, isn't it?
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.440]   The color problem.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.400]   But how has the color problem ever come into being?
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.520]   Why is there a color problem?
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.280]   You know the answer?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.800]   Because of slavery.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.680]   They wanted to make money quickly.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.280]   You make money quickly by getting men to work for you who are slaves.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.320]   You buy them for a pittance and then they do their work for nothing.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.360]   "Wonderful," said those men of two hundred years ago and up to a hundred years ago during
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.800]   the American Civil War.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   "Marvelous!
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   We're getting labor for nothing.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.080]   We're going to make great fortunes."
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.640]   We've gone full cycle.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.600]   It's the major problem today, the problem of the colored person.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:47.040]   The problem has been created by greed, by avarice, by materialism, by a failure to submit
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.360]   utterly and absolutely to God.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.040]   Indeed, this has been almost ridiculous at times.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.520]   Haven't you read in your newspapers now and again?
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.920]   In fact, it happened again to the United States.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.600]   She had a problem a few years back.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.840]   I mean a problem in the realm of commerce and of trade.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   What was her problem?
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:10.960]   Well, her problem was this, that she'd got practically all the gold of the whole world.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:16.080]   We'd all become her debtors and we'd all paid all our gold to her so that now she'd got
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:23.640]   all the gold, but she'd got no customers because nobody had got any money to pay.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.960]   Now it sounds funny, doesn't it?
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.320]   But you see, that's the very thing Isaiah was saying.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.360]   You go on amassing it all.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.400]   It will turn to desolation in your hands.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.840]   It will become your greatest problem.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:38.160]   Well, now there it is in general and in terms of states and countries and empires.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.240]   But my dear friend, it's equally true of the individual.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.280]   There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:50.600]   And if you try to live this life of the materialistic outlook and banish God from your thoughts
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:55.880]   and think you can get satisfaction in things and goods and possessions, you'll never be
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   satisfied.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   Never.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.600]   There'll always be somebody who's got more.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.440]   Or you'll feel that you're not having your right or a thief comes in or moth and rust
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.400]   corrupt and you think you're losing things and you are.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.800]   And the things you value no longer count.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.160]   They go out of fashion and you're left penniless.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:18.240]   It's like that in life, but then you come to the end of your life.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.000]   And what have you got?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   You've got nothing.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:31.280]   "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither."
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.720]   I can't take these things with me.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.040]   I'm nothing but a soul after all.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.200]   But I've neglected my soul.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.000]   What shall it profit a man?
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:50.080]   Shall he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.160]   God won't allow man to have satisfaction in things, for he's made them for himself, and
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.600]   man is too big for this.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.720]   God won't allow man to insult himself.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.240]   God blows upon it all and it all becomes desolation.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.640]   And at the end, man is left in a final hopelessness and despair.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:14.800]   "Woe unto them," says God, "the Lord of hosts in mine ears hath said."
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:21.280]   And what he has said, he always and certainly performs.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:30.160]   He's doing it before our very eyes today, nationally, internationally, individually.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.320]   Is there any hope?
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   Is there any way out?
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.680]   Of course, that's why God sends the prophet.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.880]   You see, though this is so true of us, though we are such fools as to make ourselves so
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:47.480]   small and insult ourselves and deface the image of God in his great and glorious love,
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.920]   he doesn't abandon us.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.160]   His message is not only a message of wrath.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.920]   There is also a message of mercy.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:04.280]   He raised these prophets to call the nation to repent, to think again, to realize what
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.080]   they were doing.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.360]   And ere it was too late to turn back to him and to listen to him and to his ways, and
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.880]   again they should be blessed.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.520]   And my dear friend, he does the same with you and with me tonight, if we've never
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.240]   heard this message before.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:27.920]   This is his message to this modern materialistic age that is already beginning to find its
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:37.300]   flowers withering in its hens and all its glittering prizes becoming tawdry nothing.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.120]   This is his message to it.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.000]   Don't spend your time thinking about things.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.200]   Don't insult yourself by saying that a man's life consists in the abundance of the things
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.800]   that he possesseth.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   Don't become a hunter of status symbols.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.240]   You're a man!
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.440]   Don't spend your time just talking about what shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.800]   wherewithal shall we be clothed or how many houses have we got or how many fields or what
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:15.840]   sort of car we run or what sort of cot I have in my coat or any one of these things that
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.320]   men regard as everything and vital.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:26.960]   "Success, son of God, seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.720]   Put that first.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.640]   All these other things shall be added unto you.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.600]   You'll have enough and more than enough to satisfy you while you're in this life and
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.760]   in this world, but you will have started with your soul.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.360]   You'll be right with God.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.240]   You'll therefore succeed in time.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.680]   You'll succeed in death.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.320]   You'll succeed throughout the countless ages of eternity.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:54.080]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:58.560]   Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.280]   Don't live for that.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.440]   Don't set your heart on things like that.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.200]   Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:15.640]   thieves break through and steal and the terrible thief of them all is death and he comes and
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   takes everything.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.640]   What then?
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:26.320]   Well, lay up yourselves for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not corrupt
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:31.440]   and where thieves do not break through and steal.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:38.480]   My dear friend, you know the Son of God came into this world in order to purchase a great
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.560]   inheritance for you and for me.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:45.720]   And when he rose again from the dead having conquered our every enemy, do you know what
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.720]   he did?
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.840]   Well, according to the apostle Peter he did this.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:54.920]   He hath forgotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection from the dead unto an
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:07.720]   inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved in him by God.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:16.960]   For all who believe in him, if your treasure is in this world, well, if they do let off
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.440]   one of these atomic bombs you'll have nothing left.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:28.720]   But even if they don't do that, when you die you'll have nothing left.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:33.680]   But you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, you'll have an inheritance
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.560]   that is incorruptible.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.840]   Nothing can ever destroy it.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:43.240]   It's undefiled, it's pure, no moth, no wrath, no rust, no thief can ever enter in.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:48.760]   Incorruptible and undefiled and it fadeth not away.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:56.360]   Let the world go mad in a final cataclysm and destroy itself.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:06.320]   Your life is hid with Christ in God and your inheritance will never fade away.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   There is still time.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   Where is your heart?
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.640]   Where is your treasure?
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.800]   What do you value?
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.360]   What is life in your estimate and opinion?
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.360]   What do you really think of yourself?
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   Are you ready for death?
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.760]   Are you ready for eternity?
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.480]   Here's the opportunity.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:26.040]   Repent, think again, acknowledge your folly.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:33.240]   Seek first the kingdom of God by accepting this message that God sent his only son into
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:38.120]   the world and not only that, he sent him to die on the cross to bear the punishment of
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:44.040]   your guilt and folly and sin and in him he gives you new life.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.600]   And the promise of this inheritance that shall never fade away.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.960]   Beloved people, listen to the word of God.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   Listen to history.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:02.560]   Repent if you've never done so and believe the gospel.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:10.720]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
