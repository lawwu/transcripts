[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.960]   All right.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.800]   So new segment, we want to try something new.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.000]   So back in the early days of this podcast, back when it was just me all by myself,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.760]   I used to do a segment where I would give updates about what was going
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.140]   on in the life of Cal Newport.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.080]   So I'm a very private person, but I would, on things I was comfortable
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   talking about, give a little bit of insight into what was going on into my life.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.960]   A little bit weird doing these segments because it's myself basically
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.400]   just talking about myself.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.200]   But now it occurred to me, now that we have Jesse here, we could rejuvenate
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.700]   this segment, which I call behind the curtain since, well, we are in a
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.920]   room surrounded by curtains.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.900]   So it's like what happens outside of this room?
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.480]   A segment called behind a curtain where Jesse will be the proxy for you, my
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.560]   audience, and Jesse will ask me some questions about what's going on in my
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.960]   life. I have not seen these questions ahead of time, so these are new to me.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.560]   And Jesse, let me make it clear, if I don't like them, you're fired.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   So let's just put that on the table.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   Take that $250,000 a month and go buy a new truck.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.280]   I am going to spend that on YouTube subscriptions.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.760]   Is that how that works?
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.960]   Can I spend money on YouTube subscriptions?
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.320]   One thing you can do on YouTube is you can subscribe to YouTube premium and you
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.680]   don't get the ads and you get the music.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.120]   It's actually only like $9 a month.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.520]   I do it.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.240]   It's unbelievable.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.120]   I should probably do that too.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   You save so much time when you have to watch ads and yeah, just goes right to
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.320]   the video.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.240]   So do YouTube premium.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.520]   All right.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.080]   Do YouTube premium, subscribe, leave reviews.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.000]   I don't know.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Smoke signals.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.520]   Send me encouraging telegrams so I know what's going on.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.080]   Write to your congressman and say, I like what Cal Newport is doing.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.240]   Send cards to your network executives.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.640]   I don't know.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.000]   I don't know, guys.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm terrible at that.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   All right, Jesse, behind the curtain, you have some questions for me about
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160]   what's going on in my life.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.240]   All right.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.000]   I think I'm ready for it.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.720]   All right.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.600]   So I got a bunch of questions here, so I'm just going to fire a couple off and
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.400]   we'll see how it goes.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.160]   All right.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.680]   Can you give any updates on your Ziddle casting experiment?
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.400]   All right.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.840]   You're fired.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Next, let's move on.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.800]   Um, the reason why I ask is because I remember you had the interview with the,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.320]   um, the fellow like back over the summertime.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.120]   And I was actually, I was in a cool place.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.640]   I was on a jog in Scotland on like a golf trip and I was doing that jog like in the
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.760]   morning and I heard this and I was like, this is, this sounds cool.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   And then I was in a cool place too, like near the beach, like in this, like, you
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.480]   know, nature area.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   But anyway, so I remember that.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.680]   And then you've talked about a few times, so like wanting to know.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.640]   Well, it's a good, it's a timely question because I was talking to Shreeny recently.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.080]   So one of the ideas I was talking to Shreeny, I was like, man, I should just
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.520]   have you, uh, call into the show and we could do like a Ziddle cast in back and
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   forth, like just like a 10 minute, 15 minute thing.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   So I think we could technically do that, right?
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.360]   Like we could have him call in on zoom or something.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.840]   Cause he, he, he lives in Colorado, so he's not, not be able to get here easily,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.000]   but we could have him call in on zoom and like, we could just do a Ziddle casting.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.040]   Cause he has a lot of thoughts.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.240]   He has a lot of thoughts on what I've been saying.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.840]   And he thinks like I'm missing out on some of the value.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.640]   So I think that'd be cool.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.680]   We got it back and forth.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.280]   In my own life, I haven't made any big steps forward.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   I mean, I'm still in the place where, uh, I want Roam, the tool Roam to be
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   the primary place in which I'm capturing most notes that are, with the exception
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.320]   of CS research, which requires math notation, it's a whole separate thing.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.600]   Or writing ideas and book ideas and article ideas and all that.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.680]   I want that all to be in Roam, roughly indexed in a Ziddle cast in style where
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.040]   there's a, there's a central index, but then also bidirectional links.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.640]   And I haven't really upgraded that yet because I've been slammed, which is
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.160]   his own issue I'm having in my life right now.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.840]   It's self enforced, uh, self-imposed, but pretty brutal these, these past
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.520]   months with my workload and that, to me, that's something you do when you have
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.920]   some time, so I'm thinking as the spring gives way towards summer, my schedule
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.640]   opens up, I want Ziddle cast in style system, basically capturing the place
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.360]   where I capture most of my ideas, because I have a lot of ideas and so we'll see.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.480]   And so we'll have Srinian, he could help me out and fill in.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.120]   You also just read that book, you know, back in January, right?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.000]   I mean, that book, how to take smart notes is what really
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.120]   introduced me to Ziddle cast.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.000]   And, and, and it was a cool book and I, I, I liked it and I recommend it actually.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.160]   And, and, and the listener sent it to me just out of the blue.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.200]   Uh, so I'll report back, but maybe what I'll do, here's what I'll do is like,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.160]   when I have time, I'll have Srinian and have him be my guru, like let's just
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.760]   15 minutes, walk me through, let me ask you my, my highly technical questions
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   about how to get this right, and then I'll, then I'll go try it out.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.040]   So I remain intrigued by Ziddle cast.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.120]   And I have heard from a lot of people, however, that agree with my central
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.160]   complaint that Ziddle cast and can't do thinking for you, it can't write
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.680]   articles for you, it's not in almost any position, this idea that you're just
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.520]   going to wander through your Ziddle cast and system and come out on the other
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720]   side with an article or a book or an academic paper is just not how that,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.320]   not how that works, but it's a really cool way to probably organize a lot of
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   thoughts that aren't easily put into some sort of hierarchical categories.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.600]   Okay.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.080]   Moving on, kind of related and talking about lifestyle centric planning,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.720]   which you discuss quite a bit for your own life.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.840]   Do you think you're close?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.240]   I think changes are looming.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.680]   I think changes are looming that would get me closer.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.640]   So I've done extreme lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.520]   I mean, it's why I'm a professor and not in tech startups or venture
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.760]   capital or something like this.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.800]   It's, it's why I write books.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.840]   Very autonomous and interesting income stream and very interesting to me.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   It's why we live in Tacoma park.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.160]   That was very much a lifestyle centric career planning, very explicit
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.240]   planning process of where do we want to live and why, why we want to live there.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.480]   Right now, I would say the, the main obstacle between where I am right now
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.720]   and the very clear lifestyle, and I got to say, I have this written out very
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.400]   clearly in my strategic plans documents.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.320]   I mean, I know the bullet points of what goes into the lifestyle that I'm
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.360]   working backwards to try to get in place.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.160]   Right now I still have too much on my plate.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.840]   And so the old joke on the podcast is I have 17 jobs, but like I need seven instead of 17.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:48.720]   So that that's, I think the, the, the, the next evolution to come is it's to be a
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.880]   full-time this and a full-time that, and a full-time that like three or four multiple
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.280]   things, it's just the volume of work is too much.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   My ideal lifestyle is slower and way more autonomous, less things, high
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   stakes, like, Hey, deliver a book, deliver like a really good New Yorker piece.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.560]   So high stakes, but you have nothing on your calendar tomorrow.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.040]   You know, it's up to you.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.840]   You got to figure this out.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.800]   You need to make this work done.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.400]   So, so I'm working on that.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.480]   There's some early stage visions we're working on right now too, about
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.760]   community investment, getting a little bit more involved in Tacoma park.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.800]   Maybe we need having some more.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.040]   You know, I don't want to get too much into it, but some sort of
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.160]   commercial presence here.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.640]   Do we want to be, so there's a lot of thoughts we have about being more
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.560]   integrated into what's going on in our town, which I think is interesting too.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.000]   So it's a, it's ongoing process.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.920]   Right now I have too much in the moment.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.320]   I have way too much, but strategic.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.560]   So I took on a lot of extra work because it's going to help.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.800]   I think it's important when I'm, the thing I'm doing a short live and I think
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.640]   it's important, and I think it's also going to maybe be important for my, the
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.400]   lifestyle I want down the line, but right now I'm just being crushed by it.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.320]   So I'm definitely in a mode right now where I'm thinking through what I
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.280]   want to want to want to get there.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.160]   Cause right now I'm just being crushed with overload.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.080]   You've seen it.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.520]   You've seen it.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.240]   You know, I'm kind of in and out right now.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.680]   Like I, it is there's too much going on.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.200]   Having too much.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.840]   It's just not good.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.440]   Now I'm doing it on purpose and for a temporary amount of time.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.840]   It's an initiative at Georgetown.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.920]   I think it's very important, but it brings with it a lot of work.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.600]   And I probably should have aggressively slowed down other things to compensate,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.360]   but I didn't, I added it on top of the stuff that was working just fine.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.000]   And now it doesn't add up and work just fine.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And it's too much stuff and it's organized because I'm very organized.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.680]   So it's not like I'm disorganized and I have the, technically
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   I have the time for it.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.840]   The issue is, and this is a core idea of slow productivity.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.440]   When there's too much on your plate, no matter, even if you do have the time
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.880]   to get it done, you're super organized, it's still short circuits, everything
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.080]   is stresses you out and it's not healthy.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.680]   So it's, it's a good kind of kick in the butt right now to be like, okay,
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.280]   once I finished this, I really got to get pretty aggressive again at, um, pursuing
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.600]   the, the lifestyle I have in mind.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.120]   Makes sense.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.440]   Um, kind of going with a broader question here.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.320]   You've discussed the book 4,000 weeks that you read recently.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.200]   You told Tim Ferriss about, I haven't read it yet, but I will.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.560]   In generally, do you find that time goes by very fast?
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.360]   Um, yes.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.960]   I mean, it, it depends on, it depends on what's going on.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.360]   These types of seasons, like winter, where it's, there's a lot going on.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   It's this, then this, then this, then this, like this day's basketball
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.760]   and this day I teach, and so you have this sort of very regular schedule.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.840]   That's, uh, each day is different than the one before, but it's regular each time.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.400]   I always feel like time moves very fast during those seasons.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.880]   And then when you're in like the summer and there's not a schedule like that,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.040]   and it's much more autonomous, I feel like time moves much slower.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.160]   So summer feels like a long time to me.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.360]   Usually winter feels very fast.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.920]   Like, are we in February already?
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.680]   We're in mid-February already.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.200]   I mean, I don't mind it because like winter's not the best time anyways,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.520]   but, um, yeah, winter's fast.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.040]   And then, so does that lead to like broader thoughts about, you know,
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.520]   getting older and stuff like that and not being able to do certain
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.560]   things or not really for you?
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.240]   Like that's the 4,000, 4,000 weeks things.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.560]   I'll tell you, I definitely started thinking about that with, uh, 40 looming.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.640]   Right.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.800]   Um, because there, there's a lot of things, especially if you're looking
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.640]   at bigger types of achievements, there's a lot of things where you say, uh, if
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.000]   that's not happened by 40, that's not on your list, this is like a key Oliver
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.600]   Berkman thing, like, I think about this with writing, like I've been a successful
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.920]   writer, there's writers that are a lot more successful, you would think, yeah,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.000]   you're where you're going to be.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.920]   Like you've taken your swings.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.720]   You've been doing this since you were 20 years old.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.320]   You've written seven books, like you've taken your swings and it's gone well.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   But if you were going to be a absolute top of the market writer, you'd be an
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.120]   absolute top of the market writer.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.520]   Like same thing with computer science, like you've done good computer science.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.040]   But if you're going to be like a breakout brain in that world, you would
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.160]   have been a breakout brain in that world.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.360]   You've been doing this for a long time.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   You know, and I never really, in the thirties, you still feel like
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.360]   you're working on things.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.160]   40 feels like, yeah, this is, this is like the, this is where these are my levels.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.520]   So how do we build a life around it?
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.600]   And that might be overly pessimistic, but that's kind of an Oliver
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.880]   Berkman point, which I like.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.840]   Uh, as big as there is one key exception to that though.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.800]   So I've gone down a Taylor Sheridan rabbit hole.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.040]   You know this guy?
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.240]   No.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.680]   Okay.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:56.120]   So, um, he was an actor and he, so he was an actor probably best known for
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.000]   being on sons of anarchy on FX.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.160]   The main character?
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.840]   I don't know the show.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.680]   I've seen the show.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.920]   I've seen the whole show.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.200]   He's like a lantern Jod.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.880]   He's yeah.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.280]   I know.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.760]   Okay.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.520]   So he's like a big character in that anyways.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.320]   Um, but he grew up on a ranch, right?
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.560]   Like he, he came out of, uh, and he owns, owns a ranch coming up, come up out of a
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.440]   ranch in his, so after the age of 40, he said, I'm going to screenwrite.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.120]   And he was going to do a neo Westerns, which is like the, the new type of Western.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.880]   I think the Coen brothers kind of helped usher this in with no country for old men.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.160]   So it, it, neo Westerns, they take place in.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.120]   Ma in our modern world.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.160]   And some of the, the issues are not, uh, there's like a abandoned coming to town.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.040]   It's like the economic hardships of whatever.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.200]   And so he's like, great.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.760]   I'm just going to like, start writing these types of things.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:54.160]   And he wrote, uh, Sicario, hell and high water, and then wind river, just
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.080]   like rattled off these like great movies started writing in his forties.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.160]   His second movie was Oscar nominated for best screenplay.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.680]   Um, wind river, he directed like, just kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.040]   He just had such a clear vision.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.560]   Uh, and then he did the show Yellowstone, which has become a huge, a huge phenomenon.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.120]   So then he did the show Yellowstone and then there's a spinoff and
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.320]   they're doing another spinoff.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.240]   And, and he, he's part of, uh, I don't know if we talked about this on the show,
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.960]   but in Yellowstone, there's this huge ranch in Texas, a real ranch called
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.240]   the 66, 66, four sixes, and it's huge.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.840]   I think it's a over a hundred thousand acres.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.720]   It's like six times the size of Chicago.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.240]   And he's part of a group that just bought it.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.560]   And they're going to, then they have a spinoff of the show that
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.920]   like takes place on that ranch.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.160]   And he's like a horse Wrangler.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.760]   So like often in this show, Yellowstone, he's a character in the show and he's
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.240]   always just doing crazy things on horses and all the horses in the show are his
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.800]   horses.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.440]   Anyways, he started all that after 40 and just sort of redefined,
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.240]   redefined the genre.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.840]   So you never know.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.760]   What I'm saying is I think, I think we need a ranch.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.120]   We should, we should broadcast.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.680]   We should broadcast from a ranch.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.520]   It would be episode one, but guys are reporting from my ranch.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.760]   Episode two, you'd be like, it would be you.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.240]   He'd be like, I have sad news.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.400]   Cal's 40 miles in the other direction on a horse and his cabin writing some poetry.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.680]   No, I was going to say more.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.960]   Cal has been killed.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:28.000]   Uh, he has been trampled by, trampled by his snake bitten body was trampled by
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.640]   horses and then dragged by cattle through barbed wire because he has no idea what
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.000]   he's doing.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.200]   And also the ranch is on fire.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.480]   That's what would happen.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.240]   Um, yes, I worry about that.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   I don't know if I worry about it.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.840]   I think about it.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.480]   And I never thought about that before until I realized I was going to turn 40 this year.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.720]   Interesting.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.840]   And then I was like, Oh my God, I guess this is like, I'm no longer like the hungry
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.240]   upstart thinking like, what am I going to, what's the thing I'm going to do?
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.280]   Where am I going to break out?
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.320]   But also I'm pretty happy with where I am.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.040]   Uh, so it's not bad, but it's definitely, definitely an adjustment.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.840]   You want another question?
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.600]   I'll just do one more.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.760]   All right.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.680]   Final question.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.600]   You talk a lot about training, like an athlete.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.360]   Are there any athletes that you closely follow that you like that, you know,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.320]   resonate with you based on like their training resume and like what they do,
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.080]   what they're all about?
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.320]   Well, our man Scherzer.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.560]   You know, a little bit of something about his training regime, right?
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.480]   But he's, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.560]   He's a beast, right?
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.720]   I mean, obsessed.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:35.000]   He was able to, he was obsessed and, uh, was able to keep his career going.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.960]   I mean, the deal he just signed with the Mets.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.360]   He's old, man.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:38.840]   I know.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.120]   Younger than us, but he's old.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.520]   That's a big deal.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.320]   That's a lot of money.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.120]   Um, yeah, that's all training and competitive.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.480]   That's competitive fire right there.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.800]   Just that like lasers.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   Um, so I like that.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.480]   I follow him.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.840]   I like to think I'm like the, the Max Scherzer of, I have to go incredibly narrow
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.120]   here.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   I'm like the Max Scherzer of podcasts that are in a Q and a format and that deal
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.320]   mainly with questions about like work and productivity and our, uh,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   [inaudible]
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   [music]
