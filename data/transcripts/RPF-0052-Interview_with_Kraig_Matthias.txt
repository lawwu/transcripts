[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.660]   Radical Personal Finance episode 52.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:57.140]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Tuesday, September the 2nd, 2014. My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host,
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.500]   your guide,
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500]   your confidante.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.700]   I can't think of any other adjectives.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:12.140]   I'm your host, and today's show is going to be an interview with Craig Mathias from createmyindependence.com.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:24.780]   I probably should be able to figure out some better adjectives and better
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.420]   terms and what not to describe myself. I'll work on that. Note to self. Mental note to self.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.780]   Thank you for being here after a long holiday weekend. I hope you had a great weekend.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.220]   I did. Had a nice time with my family and friends and really had an enjoyable time. My wife and I went out to celebrate
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.660]   yesterday. We went out and celebrated by eating some sugar. We've been doing this thing to try to
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.060]   cut back, so we've been eating sugar once a month. So every month at the end of the month,
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.540]   we go out. We got all the sugar out of the house and stopped adding sugar to everything and decided to stop eating sweets.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.540]   But every month at the end of the month, then we are going out and enjoying some sugary indulgence.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.620]   So last month was cheesecake factory.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.300]   Yesterday was
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.100]   Dairy Queen.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.420]   I thought yesterday was the last day of the month. I didn't even realize it was a holiday weekend until
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.540]   Saturday. I think it was when we realized we figured out it was going to be a holiday weekend.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.780]   So we wound up having a great holiday weekend.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.820]   I took it off and decided to cancel the show that I had planned for yesterday and had a good time with my family.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.220]   I hope you did too.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.500]   Today, however, we're back on the saddle.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700]   I'm going to be working hard here in the month of September to bring you some really great content.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.940]   Today's show is going to be an interview with a man named Craig Matthias,
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.260]   who is a blogger at createmyindependence.com.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.980]   Craig is a really neat guy. I actually met Craig when I was out at the Podcast Movement Conference in Dallas a couple of weeks ago.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.660]   We wound up having a really great time together.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.140]   I enjoyed meeting with him, enjoyed getting to know him.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.740]   In talking with him, he blogs about some financial topics and then also about business. You'll hear that in his story.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.420]   But I was so impressed just with his story and with listening to him and learning from him as far as where he is.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.940]   I want to be explicit with how I say this.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.620]   It's important to me to bring you access to people that are at every stage of the journey.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.740]   What I loved about Craig's story is that in many ways,
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.820]   and I hope this is not meant to... I want to build him up because I really think he's an awesome guy.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.300]   This is not meant to diminish him as a person, but he's just an average guy.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.620]   He's an everyman. To me, this is what was really amazing about his story when he was telling me at the conference.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.180]   He's just a really neat guy, a normal guy with a neat personality who had some good ideas as far as how to set out and follow his financial plan.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.180]   He wasn't earning an excessive amount of money, but he's building a business now and you'll hear in the interview.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.580]   He started off deeply in debt and over a period of a few years was able to pay off his debt,
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.820]   recover from some financial mistakes, accumulate some savings and launch out and start an entrepreneurial venture.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:23.420]   The tips and strategies and ideas that he shares in the interview are accessible to anybody.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:33.420]   There's nothing necessarily special about his story other than that he set a plan and followed it out.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:41.100]   I really had an enjoyable time with this interview. I hope you like it. I hope that you're able to learn something from it.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.340]   Craig, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate you being with us today.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.260]   Definitely. Thanks for having me.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.500]   What I'd like to start with, share with us a little bit about your background, especially as it relates to money so we can know where you're coming from personally.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:06.540]   I'm about 30 years old and when I was growing up, I really like to talk about the two financial influences that I had.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:15.020]   They were my dad and my grandpa. My dad was this real frugal guy that, from my standpoint,
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:25.020]   it just looked like he was a cheapskate and it looked like he was no fun because he never would get us the cool things that all of the kids in school had and their parents had.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:36.540]   Then there was my grandpa who liked to have all these fancy toys. He bought all these fancy cars and trucks and lawnmowers because he was a farmer in his early life.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:46.460]   He had all these cool toys that he liked to take care of and polish up. I gravitated towards his type of thinking about money, which was buying cool things with it.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.500]   Shocking.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:06:00.060]   Yeah. I really was kind of rebelled against my dad's way of doing things because to me that seemed like, I don't know, it took away from fun.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.940]   It took away from, "Hey, it would be cool to have all these cool things because then people think that you're doing well."
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:15.420]   You know what I mean? It's kind of a status thing in society. A lot of things we couldn't have because of that growing up.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.140]   So I rebelled against my dad's way of thinking.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.780]   But then it really started changing around college and after college.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:30.860]   My dad passed away actually when I was 17. So that influence kind of shut down around that time and so did my grandpa actually.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.700]   I became an adult at the same time that I didn't have these influences anymore in my life.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:44.540]   My mom was always kind of someone that would give us what we wanted.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.460]   So my brother, I saw him getting a little bit spoiled. He had a car sitting in the driveway before he was even 16.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.660]   Whereas I had to buy my own car, at least at that point, my dad would say, "Hey, you're going to buy your own car. We're not giving you a car."
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.540]   But then once he passed away, my mom just gave me the car.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.900]   Did your dad do a good lot of financial planning? Did he have insurance? Is that why she was feeling flush?
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.460]   Exactly. My dad did. He had a lot of life insurance. He set my family up really well.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.100]   Great.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.980]   My mom had the money to take care of us.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.580]   What a legacy. That's great.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.100]   It was a legacy, but it also spoiled us in those days and it could have turned out pretty dangerous.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.500]   So in college years, my mom bought me that. She gave me that first car.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.300]   Then she co-signed a loan for a second car and ended up paying for most of it.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:41.260]   So I got that second car, which was way nicer than I could have ever bought myself for really not very much money at all.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.460]   Then I went to college. My mom really helped me with that.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.940]   All throughout college, I really didn't know what it was like to have to actually pay for things.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.900]   Then when I got out of college, I got my first job.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.460]   Then I was kind of on my own as far as not really relying on my mom anymore.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:04.060]   About nine months later, I took a road trip with a friend and my brother all the way down to California from Minnesota.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.180]   We took my car, the paid-for car that my mom helped me pay for. I didn't really realize the value of it.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.740]   Well, that car broke down in California and it needed about $2,000 worth of repairs.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:23.500]   Being young and stupid, I was easily talked into just dumping it and buying a new one.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.380]   Over a repair bill?
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.100]   Yeah, because they said, "Hey, you know that $2,000 bill will make a great down payment for a new one."
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.980]   Wow.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.220]   You say that to a 22-year-old and boom.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.220]   It's compelling. Sure. Understood.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.540]   It doesn't take long to decide to buy a new car.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.980]   I decided to buy a new car, one that I couldn't afford.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:50.140]   About two weeks into it, well, let's just say that long story short, I bought a car down there, brought it back, didn't like it.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.620]   I traded it up for a better one even yet.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:59.660]   I had a $20,000 car, 100% financed with a $30,000 a year salary.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.900]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.460]   You're nowhere near my 1/10 rule.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.020]   No, not at all.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   That's what started it.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:17.900]   I got back here and I knew how big of damage that car was going to give me because I calculated how long it would take me to pay that thing off.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.900]   Even if I threw every dollar I could towards it.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.900]   It was going to be years.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:28.780]   Given my small salary, it just really changed things because I never really liked debt.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.780]   I guess I got that from my dad.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.780]   I didn't like the feeling of having debt.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.260]   I knew that, wow, this is a big debt here, $20,000.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260]   That changed things.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:46.060]   After that, I started looking around, "Hey, what can I do to get out of this?"
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.060]   I found Dave Ramsey.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.060]   I started saving money.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.060]   That was around the same time.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.100]   How did you find Dave? Just turning around on the radio or did a friend help you out or how did you find Dave?
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:02.540]   I think I found him either through the bookshelves at the bookstore or he, at the time, had a TV show on, I think it was Fox.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   Fox Business.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.540]   He had a Dave Ramsey show as a TV show.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.420]   I found it as a TV show, I think, and then I found his radio show.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   That's great.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   I started listening that way.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.420]   My story is kind of long. It's pretty ridiculous here, but it's throughout a bunch of years here.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.420]   Once I bought that car, I started paying it down.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:27.420]   That was right in 2008 when I bought that, so we all know what was coming up next, the recession.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.420]   The company I worked for had to lay off some people early 2009.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   I had like $500 in the bank to my name, $20,000 in debt, and I was pretty freaked out.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.420]   That really got me thinking about finance, so I started shopping the bookshelves and stuff.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:53.420]   I found Dave Ramsey, and his message really resonated with me because it was really a message that I got from my dad when I was younger, which was, "Don't borrow money."
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.420]   That's the way I was raised, really.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   I had that kind of internal way of thinking that, "Yeah, debt is not a good idea."
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:07.420]   When I heard Dave and saw his stance on that, I was like, "You're exactly right, Dave. I need to get out of this."
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:13.420]   I stumbled around a little bit trying to save money in quotes like a normal person would, trying to cut on this and that.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.420]   But then I got slammed in early 2010.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.420]   I had to have a double root canal done on my mouth.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   That was like $2,000.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:30.420]   I didn't have insurance, and then I had to put new tires on my car, and I scheduled a vacation in, being dumb.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.420]   When you're broke, you shouldn't take vacations.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.420]   Basically, I had a month where I spent like $5,000, and I only made like $2,500.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   I was going to say, how much were you earning at that time?
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   Not very much, $35,000 maybe.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:49.420]   At the end of the month, I looked back. I was trying to save money, and then I got set back like $2,500 in one month.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:55.420]   I blew a gasket, basically. I was like, "This is ridiculous. I'm never going to get out of this."
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.420]   That means I'm never going to be able to--at the time, I was thinking the American dream.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   I'm never going to be able to buy a house.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.420]   I'm never going to be able to support a family, which I don't consider that part of the American dream.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.420]   That's something that I really want to be able to do is support a family someday.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:18.420]   When I realized I wasn't on track to be able to do those things, I said, "That's it. None of these things are more important than that."
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.420]   I'm willing to sever anything that's not going to get me there.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   I sat down, wrote down all my expenses, and basically started just putting lines through things.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.420]   I cut my expenses down big time.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:35.420]   That's really where the turning point of my entire financial path was.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.420]   It was Memorial Day weekend, 2010.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   Wow, so recently.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.420]   Yeah, it was four years ago.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.420]   Wow, so how much do you remember what you were spending prior to that experience and what you wound up after that experience?
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:58.420]   Yeah, I would say maybe $20--I was probably spending $26,000, $27,000, $2,800 a month before that.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:07.420]   I don't think it necessarily happened all on that weekend, but I got down to, after that, probably averaging $1,700 a month in expenses.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.420]   Probably cut close to $1,000 out of my budget.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.420]   That's a major change percentage-wise.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:20.420]   It doesn't sound like much if you just look at the dollar figures, but percentage-wise, that's a huge, huge difference.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   Yeah, I just started getting extreme. No more eating out.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   I was sitting at home in the middle of the summer, and it was painful, but I needed to get myself out of debt.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.420]   It helped me. I was listening to Dave Ramsey's show every day after work for three hours.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   Right.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:43.420]   The only way I could get motivated was to hear--I needed to get inspiration and motivation constantly to feed that.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.420]   Yeah, when I was getting out of debt in college, a similar story for me.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.420]   My brother gave me a copy of Dave Ramsey's book, Total Money Makeover.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:59.420]   I had always been kind of this financial nerd, and I always loved reading books, but I was very much into the school of thought that,
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.420]   "Well, that is a tool. That is a financial tool."
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.420]   My brother gave me a copy of his book, Total Money Makeover, and I read it.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.420]   Then I read it again. I was like, "This guy's dumb."
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.420]   Then I read it again, and I read it three times.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   Finally, the third time, it just hit me that the major takeaway that I said was--that I took away from that was to hear the phrase,
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.420]   "If you had no payments, how much money would you have every month?"
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.420]   Just saying it that way, "If you have no payments, how much money would you have every month?"
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.420]   It just brings such a sense of peace, just that thought.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:38.420]   I worked an entire year to pay off my student loans, which I went back and found the other day.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.420]   I had thought there were more, but I wound up--I think there were about $12,000 that I had borrowed on student loans.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:52.420]   My senior year of college, I paid for my classes, which I had to come out of pocket for classes.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:15:00.420]   Then I saved up and was able to write a check two weeks before I graduated to pay off my $12,000 of student loans.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.420]   That was, for me, quite an accomplishment because I was working 40 hours a week.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:11.420]   I was taking 19 hours of class each semester and studying for my senior capstone business courses.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.420]   One of the things that kept me going through, though, is exactly like you said.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.420]   I would listen to The Dave Ramsey Show and I would download it.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:27.420]   I did his membership site so I could get all three hours on the podcast without any commercials.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.420]   I would listen to it three hours every day.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.420]   That was a huge thing.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.420]   It's like a trusted friend being there encouraging you and saying, "You can do it. You can do it."
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.420]   You can do it in a world where we don't usually talk to people about money.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.420]   I can empathize with your story.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   Nice job on that, by the way.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.420]   Thank you.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   Killed it.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.420]   It was a real learning experience, but it opened my eyes.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.420]   The key thing, it opened my eyes to a couple of things.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:16:01.420]   It opened my eyes to seeing how if I sat down and made a plan--because what I had to do is I had to sit down and figure out--
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.420]   A, I had to set a goal.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   When I set the goal, I said, "You know what? I wonder if I can be out of debt before I graduate from college."
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.420]   I had some credit card debt, too. I forgot.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:15.420]   I had borrowed something like $3,000 or $4,000 on credit cards to get myself through school.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.420]   I was putting gas and all this stuff on my credit cards, and I was broke.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   I forgot.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.420]   It was like $12,000 of that plus $3,000 of credit card plus cash flowing what I didn't have covered with scholarships and college.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.420]   I remember sitting down and just saying, "I wonder if I could do this by the time I graduated."
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.420]   I didn't really for sure know that I could, but I said, "Why don't I just shoot for this?"
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.420]   I set this really extreme goal, and then I had to sit down.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   I went to my boss at the time, and I said, "I'm thinking about going back to school."
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:53.420]   I'll cut a long story short, but basically I had to make a budget.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.420]   I sat down, and I said, "I'd like to continue working for you guys, but I need to work it around my class schedule."
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   I got very organized, and I sat down, and I put out all my classes that I needed to get done, set out my class schedule.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.420]   I had taken a semester off, and so I was behind where I needed to be.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.420]   I needed to go to summer school and take classes during summer school.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:18.420]   I charted out every hour of my week, the 168 hours, and I made a budget for my time.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   I knew exactly where I was going to be and exactly what I was going to do every single hour of the week.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   It wasn't necessarily fun in this sense.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:34.420]   I remember there were several times, because I gave myself Friday evenings and Saturday evenings off,
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:43.420]   and then I gave myself Saturday afternoon for rest and relaxation, and then Sunday morning for church.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.420]   I gave myself until about 2.30 p.m., and then at 2.30 p.m., I had to start doing homework.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.420]   I remember being so bitter sometimes on Sunday afternoons.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.420]   Where I went to school was right on the intercoastal in West Palm Beach,
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   and I would go down to the seawall, sit on the water with my textbooks,
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.420]   and I would be like, "I cannot wait until I don't have to study on a Sunday afternoon."
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:08.420]   But even to this day, I hate to do anything work-related on a Sunday because of that, because it went so deep.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.420]   But it just showed me the power.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   I got better grades.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   I got straight A's that year, and I learned more.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:22.420]   What I found was, instead of in my earlier years in college, where I felt like I was smarter than the professors,
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.420]   all of a sudden, when I was doing my homework, I found out how smart my professors were all the time.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.420]   It was a real turning point in my life.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.420]   It was a real turning point.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.420]   Wow.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.420]   I'm interviewing you, and there I derailed it.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   So my point was that I appreciate--I can empathize a lot with your story of how nice it was to have the voice of an encourager.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.420]   Exactly. We're both kind of the same mold there.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   We just need that to be able to be inspired on a daily basis, because this stuff takes quite a while to get through.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.420]   So how long did it take you?
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.420]   Once you got focused, how long did it take you to get out of that?
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.420]   Actually, not very long.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.420]   I had made some progress by that point.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   The car was bought.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.420]   I came out of college with about $6,000 in student loans.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.420]   I know that's not much, but let me give you a couple reasons there.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.420]   One, I didn't have good enough grades in high school to get into a good school straight out of high school,
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.420]   so I ended up having to go to a community college.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.420]   I "had" to, in quotes, go to a community college, which ended up saving me huge.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.420]   The tuition was like $1,500 a semester. Nothing.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   So that's one of the reasons. I got lucky, kind of, by having to go to a community college.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   And then I had help, because my dad set my mom up well, and that was something that was planned, the financial aspect of it.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.420]   I was taken care of, and I know that.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   I was blessed to come out of college with only $6,000 in loans.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.420]   So I had the $6,000 out of college in 2007, and then I got myself into $20,000 in 2008.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.420]   So I was $25,000 in about the summer of 2008.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   And then I paid off probably, I don't know, maybe $5,000 to $10,000 throughout that year.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   I guess this would have been two years later.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:21.420]   I don't remember exactly where I was at around that time of May 2010, but I don't know, maybe $15,000 left in debt, probably.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:26.420]   I paid off my last debt by the end of December 2010.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.420]   So it was only about seven months later I was out of debt.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.420]   Awesome.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   Seven months after I made that huge commitment to get out.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.420]   And I told everybody, I said, "I'm planning to be out of debt this year, by the end of the year."
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.420]   And they said, "What? How is that even possible?"
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.420]   But I did it.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   Right.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.420]   And I love that, you know, even just following the Dave Rangsley plan, he's very clear.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   If you're going to get out of debt, you need a plan that gets you out in one to two years.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:56.420]   Now, there can be exceptions, but that one to two years is a good amount of time where you can really focus and stay committed
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   and take whatever action is necessary to get there, and it applies that real focus.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   And so that's a -- I mean, it really is, it seems to me to be a real key to success.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.420]   Yeah, so --
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:16.420]   So from there you started saving 15% of your income in gross stock mutual funds, you know, split evenly between aggressive growth,
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   international growth in income, and growth mutual funds, right?
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:26.420]   Started saving 15%, you fully funded your six-month emergency fund, and you worked very hard on getting rich and giving it all away, right?
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.420]   And so now you're continuing to -- right? You're following the Dave Rangley plan, right?
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.420]   No, I basically stopped right there with the Dave Rangley plan.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.420]   [Laughter]
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   That's funny.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   So what then? And I'm cheating because I know, because we met at Podcast Movement Conference.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.420]   So how's that for a soft fall?
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.420]   After you got out of debt, then what?
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   Well, I actually did try to continue with his plan throughout what I thought at the time was baby step 3B.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   So he basically says, "Get out." I think Dave Ramsey's the best for getting it -- helping you get out of debt.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.420]   I don't think there's anybody out there better than him.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.420]   I really believe that.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.420]   So I think he's great for that.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   And now you'll find that everybody's going to bash him on the investment side of things.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.420]   I say, "Whatever, you know, just go do your own thing."
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   Like, there's no reason to bash him on that.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   Maybe he's not -- that's not his strength.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.420]   His strength is getting out of debt.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.420]   So he's got a step after you get out of debt that's called baby step 3B.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   And that's basically where you don't start saving for retirement right away or anything.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   What you do is you take that money that you were piling all towards debt,
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.420]   and you save it up for a down payment for a house.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   So at the time I thought, "Hey, I think a house is next."
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.420]   And I was so against debt at the time that I was thinking,
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:46.420]   "Hey, I'm going to try to save up and pay cash for a house."
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.420]   I had this crazy idea that I could do that.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   And so I started piling all this money away for that reason.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.420]   But then things started changing as far as --
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   well, let's say I think about a year went by where I was doing that.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.420]   I was going to pile it away probably for a house.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   A lot of things happened that year.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.420]   That was 2011.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   One, I started making a lot more money at work.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   The income rose by $20,000 I think that year.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.420]   Why? What did you do?
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   I just rocked it for the company I was working for.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   It was a small company.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   We were growing throughout the recession.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   We grew from about -- from 2007 when I started we had about four employees,
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   about $200,000 in revenue.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   When I left in 2013 we had about $3.5 million in revenue.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   So we like over 10X'd it.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   Okay.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.420]   And were you involved in sales?
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.420]   Like were you involved in contributing to that revenue?
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.420]   Yeah, I was.
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.420]   I wasn't involved a ton in sales, but I was involved in sales.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:52.420]   I was involved in our relationships with industry partners.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   I was involved with -- I was a team leader.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   I became the COO of the company actually.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.420]   So I was basically internal operations.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.420]   I ran most of the internal operations.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   And things were just going well.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.420]   My boss just started dumping money at me throughout that year.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   Awesome.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.420]   It was awesome.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   And another thing, my grandma passed away,
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   and I ended up getting a little bit of an inheritance.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.420]   It wasn't huge, but it was I think around $10,000.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.420]   And so a bunch of things, you know, more money from the company,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.420]   I got this inheritance, and I was out of debt all at the same time.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   So when you're out of debt, just like Dave Ramsey says,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.420]   when you don't have payments, all of a sudden you have all this extra money.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   So throughout that year all this money started collecting.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   I'm talking, you know, thousands every month or whatever.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   It just started collecting.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   And I just threw it over to the savings account.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.420]   I didn't know what to do with it.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   I thought I was saving for a house.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.420]   So by the end of the year, that's about when I started my blog,
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.420]   was the end of 2011.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   So it was a year after I got out of debt.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.420]   I believe -- I don't know.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.420]   I probably had like $30,000 or $40,000 in my savings account.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.420]   And I was, you know, debt-free.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.420]   So that changed a lot.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.420]   It changed my life quite a bit.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.420]   But then throughout that next year, probably 2012,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.420]   is when I kind of realized, hey, maybe I don't want to buy a house.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.420]   And I got into this -- I don't know.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.420]   You know, there's a lot of stuff out there I started reading about, I don't know,
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   early retirement and freedom and all this stuff about just being able to do what you want with your life.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   There's a lot of articles out there that talk about the downsides of home ownership,
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   which I really never thought about until that time when I actually had the money to buy a house.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   I paused a little bit and decided, hey, you know what?
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.420]   This apartment is actually working out pretty well for me.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.420]   What do I need to go rush in to buy a house for?
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.420]   I don't have a family yet.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   It's just me.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   You know, this money doesn't need to be spent.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.420]   Right.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.420]   And so I just decided not to spend it.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   And at the end of 2012, I decided to invest it in the stock market instead of buying a house with it.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420]   I did.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   I got in at a good time.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   I wish I would have gotten in earlier, but throughout the next year, I made like another $15,000 or $17,000 in the stock market.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   So basically, those few years, I completely was out of debt.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.420]   I stopped blowing my money on stupid stuff.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.420]   I never did raise my lifestyle again after 2010.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   Even when I was out of debt and I started making $20,000, $25,000 a year more, I didn't raise my lifestyle.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.420]   I left it down there at about $1,800 a month.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:38.420]   And so after about, what was it, three years, three years after that, so we're talking about spring or early summer 2013,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:47.420]   I had made it up to five years worth of living expenses saved because it just all piled up.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   That's awesome.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.420]   You know, I was $2,000 a month or so I was transferring over to my savings account or investments.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.420]   Awesome.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.420]   Good for you.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:00.420]   And then I got to a point where entrepreneurship was always my dream and I wanted to do it.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   And I got to a point now where just in 2013 where I just didn't see any reason why it wasn't time to give it a shot.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.420]   I had the money.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.420]   I definitely had a good enough savings cushion.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:21.420]   I had five years worth of -- if I stopped earning any money, I could go five years without defaulting on any of my bills, without going into debt.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.420]   It gives you an amazing --
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.420]   I was going to say it gives you an amazing buffer when starting a business.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.420]   Yeah, so I had that buffer.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   And at the same time, the whole success at my job just started -- basically it went away.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:43.420]   It just -- you know, things just happen and there's like a -- there's just time.
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.420]   Everything has its time.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:57.420]   And I feel like, hey, even though during 2011 I was doing so well in the company and me and my boss had such a good relationship, you know, he was giving me raises like every couple of months, that -- it all ends.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.420]   It doesn't all last forever.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   So, you know, maybe you love your job now but maybe in five years you won't.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.420]   And in 2013 I started -- I was miserable at my job.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.420]   So I had to leave.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.420]   And that's -- I pulled all these things together.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   The fact that I wanted to become an entrepreneur, I had started a platform, I had an online platform and built a ton of relationships and stuff.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:31.420]   And I had all this money so I just decided it was time and I -- that's when I decided to leave my full-time job and go full-time -- just dive headfirst into entrepreneurship.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   And many people would probably call me stupid for doing that but I just think I just had to do it, you know.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.420]   How long ago was that now?
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.420]   It was just over a year ago.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.420]   July of 2013.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.420]   Okay.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.420]   And what's your business?
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   Well, I've been figuring that out.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   [laughter]
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   Right away I really didn't have one.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:57.420]   But I knew it was possible that I could figure out what -- I could figure out ways to generate income streams.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.420]   Because here's my goal.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   I want to create a location-independent business that brings in enough income to support me and my future family.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:15.420]   And I want to be able to work on my terms, work with people I want to work with on things I want to work on when I want to work.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.420]   And I don't really care what my business is.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.420]   I could have five businesses as long as they're all things that I enjoy.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.420]   And, you know, that allows me the freedom to do what I want with my life.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.420]   And so at first I didn't really have a lot of ideas.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.420]   I thought, hey, maybe I'll sell something on my blog.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.420]   That'll give me a stepping stone to the next thing.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.420]   Maybe I'll start something else.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:48.420]   You know, I have all these entrepreneurial ideas and I knew I could figure something out.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.420]   So over the last year I've been through an entire -- a big, long journey.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.420]   It's been quite the year.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:04.420]   But at this point I've started earlier in this year, 2014, I started a service business based around WordPress development for entrepreneurs.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.420]   And I named the business Matthias Media.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:18.420]   And I just started doing WordPress development, building websites, building blogs, helping entrepreneurs build their platforms.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.420]   And I also got into helping entrepreneurs create membership sites.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:29.420]   There's a whole group of entrepreneurs out there right now that are looking to monetize their online platforms with membership sites,
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:40.420]   whether it's an online course or it's a mastermind group or some kind of an inner kind of site that's password protected where they sell access to.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.420]   Huge deal right now out there in the online entrepreneur space.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.420]   I've dabbled into starting to create those membership sites for people.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   And I've gotten pretty darn good at it.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.420]   And over this last year now, let's see, what is it?
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:31:02.420]   Today is September 2nd and I've generated over $20,000 in revenue this year so far.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   That's fantastic.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:11.420]   So it's coming to a point where it's not going to be a heck of a lot farther where I'm going to be able to actually cash flow everything.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.420]   That's fantastic.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.420]   My life and my business.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.420]   Congratulations, Craig.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.420]   That's awesome.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.420]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.420]   So the cool thing about this is that I can work on my terms.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   I get to work with who I want to, when I want to, from where I want to.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   So I see a future full of freedom and the ability to spend time with my family, travel.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.420]   This is cool stuff.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.420]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:43.420]   Did you, when you first started, like did you find yourself, I mean when you first quit, excuse me, I'm asking the wrong question.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   When you first quit, did you find yourself just wanting to sit around?
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.420]   Did you find yourself getting bored and needing to work or wanting to work?
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.420]   Or how did you approach that whole, "Hey, I'm sick and tired of working.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   Let me just sit around and watch TV all day," versus, "I want to do something productive."
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.420]   You know, I don't think I was ever to the point where I'm sick and tired of working.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:14.420]   But let me give you an insight into the reasons why I quit my job and why I didn't go get another one.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:22.420]   I would go into work every day and I would have to listen to whatever they wanted me to work on.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.420]   So it's, "Hey, it's your job."
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.420]   And one day we had a meeting and it said values, company values.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:34.420]   And they were like, "We want you to spend 40 plus hours at the office every week."
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.420]   You know, it's not just 40, it's 50 and all this.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.420]   Like they, basically they want you to spend your entire life at the office.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:46.420]   And I'm missing out on really good summer days and just beautiful days.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.420]   And I could be spending time with my family, but I have to be there all the time.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.420]   And there was also other things that were going on.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   Like I wasn't feeling respected.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:00.420]   Sometimes the company culture gets to a point where they write people off for certain things.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.420]   Like, "Oh, that guy, he failed on that project, so I'm not going to give him another one."
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.420]   So basically there's like this feeling that you are, you're kind of written off.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.420]   Or you have qualities that aren't ideal.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:22.420]   And your faults just come to, people tend to focus on your faults, I feel like.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:27.420]   And you go to work with the same, you're kind of dependent on the same group of people,
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:34.420]   the same boss that maybe doesn't respect you anymore.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:41.420]   And basically you get to points at these jobs where they can really beat down your sense of worth.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   And your excitement, your motivation, you don't have it anymore.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.420]   You just want the day to be over.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.420]   And that's what I was doing.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.420]   I was going to work feeling like I didn't want to be there.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.420]   Feeling like I had more value than I was offering there.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:34:01.420]   And so I knew that that was, it was time to go because every day was making me feel worse
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.420]   and less valuable as a person.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.420]   And why didn't I go get another job?
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.420]   Well because I wanted to be an entrepreneur my entire life.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   That's been my dream.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.420]   I mowed lawns as a kid.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.420]   And as a teenager I had my own little business.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.420]   And I just loved it.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.420]   And I compared that to when I was, when I got my first job at 16, I was working at Walmart.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   And how do I, the clock in and clock out.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   And people were always, you know I had to be there at certain times every day.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.420]   And even on the nice days, on the weekends I'd have to be working.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.420]   You know, it's just, the whole thing just sounded terrible to me.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.420]   And I really haven't enjoyed having somebody have that much control over me my entire life.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.420]   So I forget where I was even going with this.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:46.420]   It's an interesting point because one of the things that I have, I just gave this morning,
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.420]   early this morning I gave a speech at a Rotary Club over on Palm Beach.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   And I was invited to speak.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.420]   And I talked about, I talked about retirement.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:02.420]   And the general point of the speech was that retirement is a broken concept.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:08.420]   And I was invited, and this particular group of Rotarians, not all Rotarians are this way,
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:15.420]   but this particular group of Rotarians was in the, I would say the upper age band of society.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.420]   Most of them were established.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.420]   Most of them, I would say the average age in the room was about 50s, mid-50s.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:28.420]   And the person who invited me to speak said, you know, we always love, we love to hear from younger people,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.420]   a younger perspective.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.420]   And one of the things that I've observed in a lot of the business literature that I read
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:38.420]   and a lot of, and working with a lot of people that I, that I work with and that I talk to,
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   there's a real challenge, a cultural challenge, because everything that you just said is,
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.420]   I don't want to use the word stereotypical, but it is, I'll use the word typical.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:58.420]   Typical of how many, you know, Gen Y and millennials think is exactly the way that you said.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:06.420]   And it seems to me, I frankly do not know how companies can, are going to be able to assimilate the culture.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:13.420]   I read, I've read some articles from human resource people, and they're talking about how to assimilate this culture.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.420]   I don't see how they can do it.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:22.420]   The only way I can see it is either the company is the type of company that is a very self-directed culture,
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.420]   where you're given more responsibility, nobody cares what time you come, what time you go.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.420]   That's why a lot of these startups, a lot of the big tech companies that in order to recruit, you know, attract people,
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.420]   that's what they've gone to, and it's, you know, it's infamous.
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.420]   Google is infamous for their work culture.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.420]   So either the company has the culture or it doesn't.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:45.420]   And, but everything that you just said, just for those who are employers listening,
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:51.420]   everything that you just said is something I have heard dozens and dozens and dozens of times from millennial financial planning clients.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.420]   And it's not so much that you don't want to be productive, or that you don't want to work,
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   or that you don't want to do something, or even that you dislike the work.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.420]   It's largely about the environment.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   Agreed.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   And that's where I was at.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   I didn't, I was miserable there.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.420]   It's not that I didn't want to work.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.420]   I do.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   Sure.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.420]   I did want to work.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.420]   It was that every time I tried something, I got bashed down for it.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   And coupled with the fact that I just don't like to have to go clock in at this time,
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.420]   and I don't like the reason, the fact that if it's a nice afternoon, I can't just leave,
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.420]   especially if there's nothing important to work on.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.420]   It's just that you got to sit there and look busy.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.420]   I just hate that.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.420]   I hate having to look busy when I could be doing something else instead.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.420]   There was a book, have you ever heard of a book called "Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It?"
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.420]   No, but I've heard of it.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   I found this book, it was written back in, I would say, 2006, 2007.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:52.420]   And the authors of the book, I need to, I just made a note, I wanted to get them on the show just to interview them.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:58.420]   I was interested in this, but I thought this book was going to be the ultimate answer to this problem that we're describing.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.420]   And in the book, there were two authors, I don't remember their names,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:07.420]   I think they were both, I think it was two ladies, if I remember, and they were human resource consultants.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:15.420]   But they were talking about essentially transforming company cultures to what they called a results-only work environment,
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.420]   R-O-W-E for the acronym, results-only work environment.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:24.420]   And their major success story was going to be the Best Buy corporate culture.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.420]   And at Best Buy, they had changed, they had come in as consultants, evidently,
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.420]   and had completely worked on the Best Buy corporate side.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.420]   And they said, "Listen, coming into the office at 7 a.m. is not coming in early,
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.420]   and leaving the office at 3 p.m. is not considered leaving early."
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.420]   And they tried to do away with all of that and said, "Each person has,"
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:49.420]   they had one of their things, and you'd have to read the book to see how it integrates in, but it sounds crazy,
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   but one of their statements, their course guiding statements on their manifesto was, "All meetings are optional."
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.420]   Nobody is required ever to come to a meeting. Your job is to get your work done.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:06.420]   Now, if your work involves you going to a meeting with somebody, you better make sure that you get the results.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.420]   But we're not going to hold you accountable because Suzy has decided she has to have a meeting,
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.420]   and you didn't show up for Suzy's meeting.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.420]   We're going to hold you accountable to get the project done, and Suzy accountable to get the project done.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.420]   But I was really disappointed because I was excited and said, "Maybe Best Buy will do really well."
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:30.420]   I haven't read a follow-up, but from what I've heard, I know that Best Buy, I believe, if my memory of the news is correct,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:37.420]   a year or two ago, Best Buy completely revoked that, and I've not heard of another company pursuing that.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:43.420]   It's a real topic of interest for me. I'd like to speak to the book authors and see if they have any insight on what worked and what didn't.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:50.420]   Because just what you describe is exactly what--I think that it doesn't have to be done in an entrepreneurial environment.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   You don't just have to work for yourself to get that, but you do have to have the type of job where it is time-flexible,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:05.420]   and then you have to have the type of corporate culture where you are held responsible for your output and for your results.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:14.420]   Yeah, and I had that. I had that at my job probably from 2008 to 2011, and I really loved it.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   I'll be the first to say that I loved my job, but things change.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:26.420]   Just because you found a job that's this way doesn't mean it's going to stay that way, because things change.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   My boss was very growth-oriented, and he wanted to grow the business.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:35.420]   So while we were 5 to 10 employees, 5 to 15 employees, I feel like we had this where I just loved going to work.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:43.420]   It was very flexible. We could basically do whatever we want, and we were all really a part of the team.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.420]   We wanted to help grow the business.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   But then once you get to a certain point, then you've got to implement all these policies,
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.420]   because people aren't coming to work, people are calling in sick all the time, people are slacking off.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:00.420]   So now you've got to implement all these policies, and I feel like that's kind of what happens with bigger organizations.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.420]   You've got so much bureaucracy that it just kills everybody's motivation.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   Right, and there can be multiple reasons.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   For example, if you're an entrepreneur, there's a certain locus of control.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.420]   There's a certain number of people to whom you can effectively relate.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:24.420]   So one person could effectively relate with 5 to 7 people and know what everyone's working on, whether or not they see them or not.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   But now if you're supervising 25 people, you're probably beyond your ability to really understand whether everyone's working or not.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.420]   So you have to have some sort of measuring, tracking device.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   And then the second is, if you're an entrepreneur and you're growing a business to sell it,
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   one of the things that you want to look at when you are building the value of a business intentionally so that it's worth more money
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.420]   is having the business systematized.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:42:00.420]   And it's a real liability for a company if they are very dependent on an employee.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:06.420]   So if I were consulting with a business owner, then I would say, "Hey, we've got Craig. He's our star guy."
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   Okay, that's good. You need to keep Craig, but you need to have Craig write down everything he does.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.420]   You need to systematize it so if Craig leaves, we can just grab another one and plug and play,
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.420]   plug another employee into that slot and give them the manual.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   But you know what? That's a terrible thing.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:24.420]   So great, that's a great thing for a business owner, but that's a terrible thing for an employee.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.420]   Exactly.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:30.420]   Because you've been replaced. You've been systematized. You're replaceable.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   That means they can boot you out. They don't have to pay you very much because they can throw somebody else in,
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.420]   give them the manual and train them.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:41.420]   And that's why there's a constant tension between what's good for employees as the business owner
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.420]   and what's good for the employee.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.420]   And that's also why wages are pressed down.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:52.420]   Because when you can, in my opinion, but I've just observed this to be the case,
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.420]   if you can plug and play an employee, then you're not too dependent on, as an employer,
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.420]   then you're not too dependent on that employee.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.420]   So if that employee says, "I'm going to organize a strike," okay, done, move, gone, next one.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.420]   Exactly.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:12.420]   But, yeah, so as an employee, and then I'll give you the floor because I want to hear from you.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.420]   As an employee, that's the reason why you have to develop those unique skills
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:21.420]   and make yourself less replaceable in order to command a higher wage.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.420]   Yeah, that's the linchpin, right, from Seth Godin, the book "Linchpin."
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.420]   He talks about this exact topic.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.420]   I've not read that.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   You know, this exact concept, Joshua, is probably what made my life miserable
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.420]   at the end of my career with my last job.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.420]   Because what I did was I was a pretty high-level guy in the company where my boss just said,
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   "Hey, you know, do these things. Develop this team."
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.420]   And I went off and read the book by Seth Godin called "Linchpin"
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.420]   where he says these exact same things.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   He says, "Hey, yeah, systematizing everything is good for the business."
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.420]   If you go read "The E-Myth Revisited" by Michael E. Gerber, you're going to see he tells you
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   that as a business owner, you need to systematize the entire thing, okay?
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   Then you go read "Linchpin" by Seth Godin, and he flips that completely on--
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:18.420]   he completely flips that around and says, "That's going to cause your employees not to be motivated."
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.420]   And so he says as a business, what you want to do is you want to give your employees
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   opportunities to be linchpins.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:30.420]   You want to give them--you want to motivate them.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.420]   You want to put them in positions where they can actually use their brain.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.420]   They're going to be better employees that way.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.420]   They're going to be more--they're going to be happier.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.420]   They're going to be more motivated.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   I took that approach and I said, "Yeah, okay, we could systematize everything,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:53.420]   or we could set up our team in a way that gives our team some motivation.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.420]   We give them opportunities to grow in their role and all that."
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.420]   I really restructured a lot on our team to give our employees--even if they weren't
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   maybe the perfect fit for a specific role, I gave them the opportunity to learn
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   how to be better at that.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:16.420]   So I gave them a wider range of opportunities, a wider range of roles,
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:20.420]   of things to do and things to grow into.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.420]   And that motivated our team a lot.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.420]   But my boss saw that.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.420]   He said, "What? Why is such and such working on this?
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   They're supposed to be just doing this."
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   And basically it caused a big problem, and I fought back, and I said,
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   "Well, I believe that this is what motivates them.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   We're giving them opportunity to learn growth.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.420]   They have all this opportunity and stuff."
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.420]   And my boss said, "No, I don't want them to have opportunity.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   I want them to just do their job."
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.420]   And basically there was this clash because I wanted to do things the Seth Godin way.
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   He wanted to do things where we just put people in their little box
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.420]   and have them churn out their results without any growth opportunity.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.420]   I didn't agree with that.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   And basically I got myself in some hot water there where my boss said,
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   "You know what? I'm not even going to deal with Craig.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.420]   He just goes off and does these things, and I don't agree with him."
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.420]   So basically I had to leave.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   So it's funny how those things are at odds with each other
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:21.420]   in ways big enough that you can get yourself in big trouble by executing on them.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.420]   Majorly. Have you read Daniel Pink's book, Drive?
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   No, I haven't.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   So you might enjoy that.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   I haven't read Lynchpin. I just added it to my list.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   But I remember there's an author named Daniel Pink who wrote a book called Drive.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   And the subtitle was "The Surprising Truth About What Really Motivates Us."
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.420]   Or something like that.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.420]   "The Surprising Truth About Motivation."
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.420]   Something along those lines.
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.420]   But one of the things that he really clarified,
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.420]   he did a lot of research into what motivates people,
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   especially and including employees.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.420]   And he found--
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   [phone ringing]
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.420]   Hang on, my computer's ringing.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:09.420]   One of the things that you find is that these--
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.420]   with employees,
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.420]   employers often think that employees just want more money.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.420]   But what he found is that the primary drivers of what people want
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   is autonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   And if people can achieve autonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose,
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.420]   then they're able to be motivated.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.420]   And the external wage is less of a factor.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.420]   It's not that it's not a factor, but it's much less of a factor
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.420]   than is a sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.420]   And I think it applies directly to what you're saying,
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.420]   is that you have that constant hustle.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.420]   And I don't know how to resolve it for businesses.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.420]   It's something I think about it a lot,
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   but I haven't been able to wrap my mind around it
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   as far as how you can possibly do it.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   I do think that maybe there's a way to combine them
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.420]   if you--through the use of technology in some way.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:09.420]   So, for example, applying the concept of systematizing everything
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:14.420]   and finding a technological way to make those systems efficient
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.420]   and documented,
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   and then providing employees with--
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   or employees with a greater degree of autonomy and mastery
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.420]   and a sense of purpose.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   But I don't know. I can't figure it out.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.420]   Yeah, I don't know either.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.420]   It's something I do think about, but I've applied it to retirement.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.420]   It's interesting because I really don't think--
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.420]   I mean, yes, there are those who do want to retire,
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.420]   but what I hear in your story is it's not so much about retiring
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   and sitting around and doing nothing.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.420]   It's more about having a sense of autonomy and a decision,
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   the ability--
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.420]   The example that stands out to me that I remember from, you know,
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.420]   "Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It"
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.420]   was they used the example of Saturday morning.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.420]   The way that we approach Saturday morning,
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.420]   where most of us, we have things we want to get done on a Saturday morning,
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.420]   and some of them are fun and some of them are work,
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   things we need to get done.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.420]   But if we're sitting down eating blueberry pancakes on Saturday morning,
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.420]   we're adults.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.420]   We get to choose whether or not I want to sit down
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.420]   and continue eating these blueberry pancakes and do my work later
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.420]   or if I want to play in the morning and work in the afternoon
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.420]   or if I want to work first and play later.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.420]   We get to choose.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   But in many ways, the corporate environment seems to hamper that choice.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.420]   Exactly.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   And, you know, I--
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.420]   That's exactly the reason why I chose to--
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   I choose entrepreneurship in my life.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   I believe these things can exist in corporate environments and everything.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.420]   I just don't want to--
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.420]   That's not going to be my path anymore.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.420]   I know that they'll exist on my own, so that's why I'm doing this.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.420]   You know?
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.420]   And I'm not saying entrepreneurship is for everyone.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   It's not.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   And you can probably accomplish these things by being an employee too.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.420]   It's just that I'm taking this other route.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.420]   All right.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.420]   So how does--
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.420]   So you're primarily doing WordPress development then.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.420]   How does all your financial blog and your financial podcast fit into that?
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.420]   You know, I'm still trying to figure that out.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.420]   I guess I started it mostly as a hobby to be transparent about what I was doing
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   and share my success with others and build a community, and I've done that.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.420]   And I continue to build that community.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:24.420]   And I am struggling on how to kind of merge that in.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   Because what I've found is that that platform--
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   It's very-- People really like it,
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   but they're not necessarily in the market to buy anything from me.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:39.420]   And I don't necessarily have anything to sell them that's going to be really valuable in that--
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.420]   or that they're going to be willing to pay a lot for in that space.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.420]   Right.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.420]   So it's been kind of a side kind of deal.
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   It does help me create and build my network,
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.420]   which is the foundation of where I've been able to build all this.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   The only reason I've been able to build my own business
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.420]   is because of that blog and podcast network that I've built.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.420]   Because a business takes-- You need to have customers.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.420]   You need to have a network of people.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   You can't exist in a vacuum and make money in a business.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   You have to-- It's people.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.420]   Business is dealing with people.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.420]   You're selling things to people.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.420]   And that's how I find my people is through my activities,
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:19.420]   through the blog, podcast, and all that.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.420]   It's an interesting story to me
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.420]   because it aligns with one of the mental models that I have in my mind
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.420]   is that everybody should have some kind of online presence,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.420]   mainly as a portfolio.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.420]   And if you have some kind of online presence,
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.420]   then that allows you to discover opportunity
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   even if the opportunity isn't where you anticipate it to be.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.420]   And the financial-- Maybe the financial blogging world--
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:50.420]   It seems to me that the financial media creation world
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.420]   is a way that some people could make a business,
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.420]   but it's a very tough business to build.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.420]   I agree.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.420]   And that's not the primary benefit of--
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.420]   Everyone making a million dollars with ads on their financial blog,
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   on their get-out-of-debt blog,
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.420]   is probably not the primary thing.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   Exposure creates opportunity.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   So it's interesting to hear you say that.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.420]   I mean, I couldn't have done this without that.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.420]   But it doesn't necessarily pay my bills by itself now.
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   It gave me all the skills.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.420]   So I'm talking about WordPress development and all this.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:29.420]   Everything that I've used to generate over $20,000 in revenue so far this year
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.420]   is because I learned all that,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   because I went out and started my own blog and my own podcast
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.420]   and started building things.
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.420]   It was all that I-- I learned all these from that.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.420]   So even if it's not going to generate--
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.420]   Even if your project that you go out and create
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.420]   isn't going to generate money by itself,
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:51.420]   it's going to teach you lessons that you can then use to go monetize.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.420]   One of the criticisms a lot of times
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.420]   in the financial independence early retirement community--
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:02.420]   One of the criticisms is that young 20-something-year-old males
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:08.420]   often have this idea that somehow they can live on these tiny budgets forever.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.420]   And they figure out and say, "Well, look, I can live on $1,700 a month,
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.420]   so therefore the 4% rule says,
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   'Well, if I can live on $1,700 a month, I only need--'"
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.420]   In that case, it'd be $500,000.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   But let's say, "I only need $100,000 of savings, and I'm set.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.420]   I'm financially independent for the rest of my life."
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:32.420]   And a lot of older people will kind of shake their head and say,
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.420]   "Well, you don't quite know what's around the corner."
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:43.420]   But you took the leap, and you said, "Well, that's okay. I've got money."
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   What have you learned as far as taking that leap?
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   And at the beginning, were you specifically saying,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   "Well, that's it. I'm financially independent. I'm not going to work"?
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   Or were you just saying, "It's okay if I spend some money while I figure something new out"?
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   Yeah, the second one.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.420]   And by the way, I never claimed to be financially independent
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.420]   because I only had five years' worth of living expenses saved up.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:14.420]   And the 4% rule or whatever would say that you need 25 years of living expenses saved up
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:19.420]   or investments and withdrawing at 4% a year.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.420]   So I only had a fifth of what I actually would have needed
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.420]   to be financially independent for the rest of my life.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.420]   Yeah, I never claimed to not be spending down.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.420]   I was open about it when I did it.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.420]   I said, "Yeah, this is going to cost me money. I'm going to have to pull it out of savings.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   I'm going to have to live off savings for a while.
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.420]   But I'm going to figure this out, and my goal isn't to not work.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:44.420]   My goal is to work independently, earning my income independent of any job or employer."
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:50.420]   So my goal was to build up independent income sources equal to that of my expenses
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.420]   so that I wouldn't have to dip into savings anymore.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.420]   I could leave my money in investments,
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:55:00.420]   and I would cash flow my life through independent income sources.
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.420]   And so, yeah, I did have those expectations.
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.420]   "Hey, this may take a year. This may take two years."
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.420]   So I kind of said, "Okay, well, that's going to burn through, you know, whatever, $20,000.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:15.420]   And this $20,000 I'm going to set aside to fund my life with while I build this business."
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:22.420]   I feel the reason I pulled that out, because you did mention that earlier,
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:26.420]   but I feel like this is a theme that--I don't know what to call it,
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:29.420]   but I spoke about it even just this morning in my speech.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:34.420]   And one of the things that--I'm not a fan of having all the money tucked away in retirement accounts.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   Because--
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   Agreed.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.420]   Do you--have you invested heavily in your retirement accounts?
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   Is all your money in your 401(k)? Is all your money out of your 401(k)?
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.420]   How do you have your money saved right now?
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.420]   I don't have a dollar in any retirement account.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.420]   Interesting.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.420]   So I like that in many ways.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:58.420]   And sometimes I worry about getting the reputation as, like, the anti-IRA guy,
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   because I'm not anti-IRA.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:06.420]   But the problem is that if you have access to capital,
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   and that capital could take various forms,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:13.420]   but if you have access to capital, then you can develop other options.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   And just the ability to get your hands on your money when you need it,
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   without having to bend over backwards and go through all this rigmarole
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:27.420]   of doing some backdoor account distribution, which is perfectly legitimate.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   I have no problem with it.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.420]   But it's got to work in the situation.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.420]   It's got to be in your financial plan to do that.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.420]   But so many young people sometimes--I've worked with clients,
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   and even this was--I made this mistake myself in starting my new business.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.420]   I screwed up.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   And I--at the time that--so A, I saved heavily in retirement accounts
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   and in various deferred investments.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   Then B, I bought a house.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:02.420]   And when I bought a house, I was very--I made my choice very carefully.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.420]   I knew exactly what I wanted.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.420]   But I wrote a check for $50,000 into the house,
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.420]   and that wiped out a good amount of my savings that I had saved.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   Well, then all of a sudden, I wound up in this--
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:21.420]   kind of this--a year ago, wound up with this very mixed up--
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.420]   planned all of a sudden to start a business, and a different business,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   and close a lucrative financial planning practice.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.420]   And that really hurt me because I had to decide,
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   well, I could pull money from retirement accounts.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.420]   I've got a certain amount of savings,
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.420]   but I didn't have enough savings to be really comfortable with just living on savings.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.420]   And so I had to go and figure out a new plan,
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   because I wasn't willing to give up on the plan,
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.420]   but I had to go and figure out other sources of income that were going to pay my bills.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:55.420]   And I'll tell you, if I had known that my life was going to take the turn that it was,
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:00.420]   then I sure would prefer to have my $50,000 back in my checking account,
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.420]   because it gives you options.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.420]   And the thing about it is that--what I like about it is that
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:10.420]   if one of the financial planning concepts--I won't call it retirement planning--
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:15.420]   because one of the financial planning concepts that I think we should develop more heavily
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.420]   is just that if we have access to capital throughout our lifetime,
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   then that capital can be the account that funds our activities,
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.420]   and we can work at a job, fund the capital account,
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   use the capital account to launch a business.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.420]   It's taken you--let's say it takes you a year and a half, two years to be cash flow positive.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:37.420]   Then in the third year, you start to be able to save money again, increase that capital account.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:41.420]   But then, assuming that business goes well, you can change in another few years
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:43.420]   and change to something else.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.420]   And just having money makes you flexible, and it's a concept I think that we've lost.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:51.420]   And I've cringed, because I've made this mistake with financial planning clients.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.420]   I've screwed it up, and I've encouraged them in the past--
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:58.420]   now, thankfully, this was a number of years ago that I can more easily admit it--
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.420]   but I had everything in retirement accounts.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:04.420]   And I look back at it now, and I put too much in retirement accounts myself.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:09.420]   I funded my Roth IRAs diligently, and I've had to learn the hard way and say,
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.420]   "You know what? I wish I had some of that cash.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.420]   Now, I could go get it, and I could pull the money out of the Roth,
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:19.420]   but I often wish that I didn't have so much in retirement accounts
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.420]   and that I had more liquid money."
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:28.420]   Yeah, and that's the exact approach I took for the exact reasons.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   And I think it just comes down to preference.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.420]   There are a lot of people that will probably listen to this and say,
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.420]   "Those guys are nuts," and, "Craig, that's just absolutely stupid.
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.420]   Why wouldn't you put money into this or that?"
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:47.420]   Well, I look at all of that as--it's just controls that are being put on my money.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:52.420]   And yeah, there is an expense for not putting my money into retirement accounts.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.420]   That expense is coming in the form of taxes.
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.420]   But I'm okay with that.
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.420]   I made that decision a while back.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.420]   Hey, what should I do with this money?
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   I've got $50,000 or $10,000 sitting here.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:08.420]   Should I put this into retirement accounts, or should I not?
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.420]   And I decided not to because I wanted to use that money.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.420]   I wanted that money to be there so I could start a business.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.420]   If I needed to use it to fund my lifestyle for a year or two,
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.420]   I wanted that money to be there for wherever my life took me
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.420]   and that I needed it for, I wanted it to be there.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.420]   And I know that, just like you said, if you put it into your 401(k),
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.420]   you put it into your IRA, well, then you've got controls put on it.
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.420]   You've got to work around their schedule on getting it out.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.420]   You've got to wait until you're 59 1/2, whatever.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.420]   All of a sudden, you put controls on your money.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:44.420]   And yeah, you get a tax break, but you've got controls.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   It's not just--it's a give and take.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.420]   You're giving up control of your money,
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.420]   and in return, you're getting no taxes on it.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.420]   You know what I mean?
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.420]   I think we talked about this down in Dallas a couple weeks ago.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.420]   There's just no one way to do this,
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.420]   and I think that's what irritates both of us so much about this
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   is that everybody says you have to put money in your retirement accounts.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.420]   And I think it just depends.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.420]   It depends on what's more important to you--
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.420]   saving on taxes or freedom, having freedom of that cash.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.420]   Right.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:22.420]   Do you have any idea how much financially, absent living expenses--
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.420]   have you invested in yourself to build your business?
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   Have you bought books? Have you bought courses?
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.420]   Have you gone to school?
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   How much have you invested in starting your business?
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:37.420]   This year alone, I've spent $8,000 in business expenses.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.420]   Okay, wow.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.420]   So probably $10,000, $10,000, $10,000, $12,000 total.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   So the key here--and there's no easy way to make an accurate calculation of this
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   because at the end of the day,
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   we're combining two things that are not necessarily comparable.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.420]   We're combining passive investments,
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.420]   doing something like buying a mutual fund and the return that you could get there
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.420]   or the return on equity with buying shares in a company,
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.420]   and then the return on your personal equity and the return on your sweat equity.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.420]   But if we were going to accurately compare them,
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:17.420]   then one of the things that we would do is we would compare the cost of the tax
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   on not using those other deferred accounts
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.420]   and then the rate of return that you could earn
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.420]   and then the rate of return that you can earn on your skills
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.420]   on investing in your own business.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   Do you feel comfortable that your rate of return that you can earn on your own business
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:36.420]   might be higher than what you could earn on a diversified index fund
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.420]   of publicly traded securities?
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:44.420]   Yeah, I think so, but that's not really how I'm thinking about this right now.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   It's more, "Hey, if I earn $1,000 more putting this money in the market
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   versus my business," that's not really what it's about for me.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:58.420]   What it's about for me is that I get to have it there, peace of mind.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.420]   I get to have it there if I need it, which is great.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.420]   I like to have my money.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.420]   There's just a certain peace of mind.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:09.420]   When you have cash in the bank, it gives you a peace of mind.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.420]   The way I think about it is I just want to move my business--
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.420]   what's important to me is moving my business forward.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:22.420]   And that's not necessarily-- everything doesn't become about this, about making--
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   it doesn't all become about money.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:29.420]   Sometimes what you're doing with your life and your purpose
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:34.420]   and your peace of mind is more important than money.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   And so I don't tend to focus.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.420]   I can tell you right now, I don't have any money, even in the stock market right now.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.420]   All my money is sitting in my savings account.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.420]   And I know that's-- there's more people that would say,
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.420]   "Hey, Craig, you're stupid. What are you doing?"
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   I'm not sure what I want to do with my money right now.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.420]   I'm not stressing out about, "Oh, it's not making money in the stock market."
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.420]   Because it's there for my peace of mind, for my--
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:02.420]   I feel good knowing that my income is not steady right now.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.420]   I know that I would freak out if the market took a tank
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.420]   and half my money went with it.
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.420]   I would freak out.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.420]   And this is not the time for that kind of freak out.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:15.420]   So money's sitting in savings where it can't be dwindled away from the stock market.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.420]   And yeah, I'm missing out on some returns, but it's peace of mind.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.420]   I feel comfortable and safe knowing that my assets are safe right now.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   They're not going to stay in my savings account for the rest of my life.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   But right now, as I get my business started, get my cash flow built up,
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.420]   the big opportunity right now is not to make 10% in the market this year.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   The big opportunity is to take my business from $20,000 to $50,000 this year.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.420]   Right.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   The market's not going to make me $30,000 this year.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   I mean, it could, but it most likely wouldn't-- won't.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   That's like a really small chance.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   But to make $30,000 in my business is very possible.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   So I need to focus on that and not on-- you know what I mean?
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.420]   I think there's more opportunity.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.420]   And I don't know if this is the question you asked,
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   but I believe there's more opportunity to make money through a business,
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.420]   at least if you don't have a ton of money.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   If you've got $500,000, maybe it's easier for you to invest it and make--
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.420]   but who has $500,000 sitting around? Not me.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   Right.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.420]   If you do, go put it in the market, kick back, and go retire.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.420]   But if you don't, then I believe it's probably--
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:20.420]   it's a good idea to just go generate income through a business.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.420]   And I think that's even a better opportunity
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   than maybe making 10% off your money in the market.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.420]   Right.
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:31.420]   When you run the numbers, and if you run conservative numbers,
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.420]   there's never been--
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:37.420]   I don't want to make an absolute statement.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.420]   I want to make an accurate statement.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:46.420]   Business is what ultimately creates wealth.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.420]   Yep.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.420]   But business is what ultimately creates wealth.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.420]   And let's just use publicly traded companies
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.420]   instead of talking about privately traded companies,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.420]   because there are many opportunities in private business as well.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420]   It's for investment.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.420]   But in publicly traded companies,
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   the big returns have usually already been made.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.420]   And that's why there's an initial public offering.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.420]   So the initial public offering is the way for the--
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.420]   generally, and this is a generalization.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.420]   There are many other reasons.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:19.420]   But an initial public offering of the shares of a publicly traded company
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   is made so that the founder of the company can cash out.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.420]   You know, like Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook guy.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.420]   He cashed out on his IPO,
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.420]   and so now he's been able to diversify his risk.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.420]   But he's never going to make as much money
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.420]   as he made building Facebook in the first place.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.420]   And so that doesn't mean--
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.420]   however, if you don't want to build business,
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.420]   then coming in and working in the publicly traded securities market
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.420]   is going to be a tremendous opportunity for you.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   But in general, I think it's better to view that
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.420]   as a way to preserve capital and accumulate capital
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   that's passive capital versus active capital.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.420]   And the difficult thing is models are valuable.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.420]   You can come up with a model.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.420]   But models all break down unless they're applied individually.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.420]   So I would love to see people--
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:12.420]   if they're going to invest money,
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.420]   I'd love to see them make some distinction between passive capital,
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   money that other people are going to be using
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.420]   by investing in a business of someone else,
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.420]   and their own active capital.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:26.420]   I'd like to see a distinction between speculative capital and safe capital.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:31.420]   Because sometimes, you know, to roll the dice on a speculative--
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.420]   on a speculation, it may pay off big.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.420]   It doesn't mean you're going to put all your money into speculation.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.420]   But we had a guest on the podcast last week.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:43.420]   He was a poker player, and he made a substantial amount of income on Bitcoin.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.420]   He saw it. He said, "I think this is a good speculation."
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.420]   He speculated on it, and his timing was good.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   Not a real great investment strategy for the long term,
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.420]   but it's certainly a good thing to do,
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.420]   and in the short term, that can be a really good option.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.420]   So we need to explore and develop some better models
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.420]   for how to view these things.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.420]   And there's nothing wrong with publicly traded securities,
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.420]   but they're not going to get you rich.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.420]   They're going to preserve the capital that you've built
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.420]   through your own business or through your own employment.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.420]   Exactly, and that's kind of how I view them, too.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:20.420]   You know, I think it's preservation of capital.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   You know, like, I will put the money that I have made,
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.420]   either through my job or through my business,
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.420]   I do plan to invest that, probably a good amount of that,
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   over the long term in the stock market.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.420]   But as far as when it comes to earning my money,
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.420]   I plan to earn it through my business.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420]   Right.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.420]   And I just feel like that's a good way to earn money,
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.420]   because you have control over things.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.420]   That's one of my biggest reasons why I have control
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.420]   over the income I make in my own business.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.420]   I don't have control.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.420]   I'm not running these publicly traded companies.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.420]   You don't have any control.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.420]   You have zero control.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   When you're investing in the stock,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   you don't have any control.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.420]   Right.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.420]   Whereas I have control over everything that happens
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.420]   in my own business.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.420]   Right.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   Excellent points all.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   Anything else you want to add here, specifically?
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   And then I'll ask you to pimp your site,
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   so we'll see if we can get you some listeners
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.420]   to your podcast and your blog.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.420]   Anything else that you want to add, though?
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.420]   No, I think we covered a good chunk of it.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.420]   I just think that, like we talked about in Dallas,
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:28.420]   there's not only one way to build wealth.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.420]   There's not only one way to live your life.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   We're always taught, just go to college,
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.420]   get a good job, then invest in--
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.420]   stay out of debt, invest 15% into retirement accounts,
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.420]   and go about living your life.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   There's not one way to do it.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   And as you can see, I'm choosing a different way to do things.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   I'm not doing any of those traditional things.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   I'm not staying in a job.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.420]   I'm not investing in retirement accounts,
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.420]   and when I was saving money,
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   which I will be saving again soon,
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   I don't stop at 15%.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.420]   I go all the way up to as much savings as I can.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.420]   If I can save 60, I save 60.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420]   And whereas this last year, I saved zero.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.420]   In fact, I've burned through some of my savings.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.420]   So there's just not one way to do it.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.420]   It's just what works for you.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.420]   Just make sure that you do what's true to yourself,
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.420]   and don't just follow other people's rules for your life.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:25.420]   The only wrong way to do something is--
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.420]   the only wrong strategy or plan
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.420]   is a strategy or plan that you can't defend.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   That would be my thought.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   It's kind of a clumsy way to say it,
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:38.420]   but what I mean is that I often--
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.420]   when I was a younger financial advisor,
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.420]   I would have told you--I said, "Craig, are you crazy?
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.420]   "You have all this money.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.420]   "You got to get this money out of your checking account.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.420]   "It's just sitting here, and it's beating away at inflation."
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.420]   Because that was what I was taught,
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420]   and that was what I took on.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.420]   But then I did--I learned, I grew,
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:58.420]   and I recognized that my primary job was a lot of times
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.420]   just to--as a--just try to poke people
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:06.420]   and see if they--see if they had a plan.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   And if a client had a plan, whatever that plan was,
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.420]   then that's fine.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.420]   So there's a big difference between having
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.420]   $100,000 sitting in the bank,
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.420]   losing pace to inflation,
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.420]   earning .0 nothing percent rate of interest.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.420]   There's a big difference between having that there
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.420]   because you just simply haven't found
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.420]   the right investment opportunity,
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.420]   and having it sit there because you're just lazy
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.420]   and haven't wanted to think about it.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.420]   And so the key is having a plan that makes sense,
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.420]   and there are many plans that make sense
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.420]   as long as they're thought through
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.420]   and the best plan at any time.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.420]   And the plan will change as time goes on.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.420]   So you make a valid point, and I agree.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:48.420]   If we can teach people--
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.420]   if we cannot just tell people--
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.420]   we'll steal the fish analogy.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.420]   If we can't just tell people, "Do this,"
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.420]   but rather we can explain to them,
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.420]   "Here's why you do this,"
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.420]   then instead of having to follow a guru
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.420]   who is by definition limited
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.420]   because they're talking to everybody,
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.420]   then we can teach people how to become their own guru
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.420]   through self-development,
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.420]   and that's really the message that I love.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.420]   Yep, exactly.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.420]   Website address for your businesses
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.420]   and for your financial blogs.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.420]   What are your website addresses?
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   CreateMyIndependence.com.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.420]   That's my blog and my podcast,
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.420]   and I talk about creating independence,
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   so I mix personal finance in with business.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.420]   It was initially a lot more personal finance-related
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.420]   as I built up my savings
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.420]   and built up my financial independence,
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.420]   even if it was only partial financial independence,
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.420]   but now it's steering much more towards business
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   as it relates to creating independent income
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.420]   so that you can take your life in the direction
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.420]   that you want to take it in.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   That's CreateMyIndependence.com,
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   and then I've also got Matthias Media, M-A-T-H-I-A-S.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.420]   It's not a heck of a lot there,
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.420]   but that's my business website.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:12:59.420]   You can go learn more there.
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:00.420]   Awesome.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.420]   Craig, thanks so much for coming on the show.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.420]   I appreciate it.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.420]   You're welcome.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.420]   Thanks for having me.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.420]   It's been fun.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   And that's the interview.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   Told you it would be good, right?
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.420]   Told you that we would learn something.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   Craig, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.420]   I really appreciate it.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.420]   I really enjoyed speaking with you,
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   and I learned a lot just from our conversation,
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   more than I had even learned
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.420]   when we were talking there in Dallas
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.420]   at the Podcast Movement Conference.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.420]   I want to take just a moment
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.420]   and highlight a couple of things
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.420]   that I learned from his story,
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.420]   and I'll try to do this from time to time
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.420]   with these interviews
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.420]   to illustrate some of the themes that I observe,
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.420]   but here are some of the themes
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:44.420]   that I observed in Craig's story
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.420]   that seemed to me to be fairly constant
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.420]   when listening to people
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.420]   and their financial journeys.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:56.420]   Number one, he had a moment of dissatisfaction.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.420]   Dissatisfaction is a good thing.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.420]   It really is.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.420]   It's a signal.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.420]   It's feedback.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   It's feedback that something should change.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.420]   So he had that dissatisfaction
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   about where he was at
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.420]   and the money that he owed,
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   and he just owed money on one car.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.420]   In many ways, not that big a deal,
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.420]   a fairly normal thing to do,
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.420]   but for him, it was a big deal.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.420]   Number two, he found some resources
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   and set out a plan,
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.420]   and that's what's so awesome
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   about what Dave Ramsey does
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.420]   with getting out of debt.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.420]   I mean, he does such an amazing job
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:31.420]   at giving such a clear, simple, straightforward plan
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.420]   to get out of debt.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.420]   He says, "Do it this way.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.420]   If you don't do it this way,
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   you're wrong, and you're stupid."
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]   [laughs]
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.420]   Some people, I try not.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.420]   Some people, though, that helps,
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:43.420]   and I tell you,
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.420]   more people have been helped by that
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   than anything else.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   And so he found some resources,
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.420]   and he followed a plan.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   Number three is that he took constant encouragement in
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   while he was following that plan.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:02.420]   Look at all of the great behavior change organizations
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:03.420]   of any kind,
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.420]   whether that's in building wealth
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   and paying off debt,
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.420]   whether that's in losing weight
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.420]   or in avoiding--
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   whether it's Alcoholics Anonymous or Weight Watchers
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   or--I don't know.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   I'm blanking on other examples.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.420]   But all of these organizations that are successful
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.420]   in helping people accomplish some change,
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   there's always constant, constant encouragement.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.420]   Any time that we're setting out to accomplish something,
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.420]   I think we've got to set ourselves up
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.420]   with constant encouragement.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.420]   That's what I hope this show can become to you,
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.420]   is constant encouragement.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   I really want to provide,
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:37.420]   in the same way that I was helped so much
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.420]   by--as Craig and I discussed in the interview--
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   by listening to Dave Ramsey's show every day.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.420]   It would be my dream that someday
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.420]   somebody could come back and say,
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.420]   "Joshua, I was so encouraged every day
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.420]   by listening to your show."
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.420]   In fact, it's an achieved dream.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.420]   I've had people say that,
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.420]   and it just--it makes my day.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.420]   It's such a rewarding, humbling feeling.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.420]   Number four, while he was working
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   and doing that plan,
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:09.420]   that didn't exclude him from starting
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.420]   to build a platform to build his blog.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   I personally think in today's world,
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.420]   everybody needs a platform.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   I know that Michael Hyatt has branded that word like crazy,
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   but it's a good word.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:30.420]   Everyone needs something that's outside of their daily job.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.420]   You need a plan B.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.420]   And what was so interesting to me
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.420]   is that what he set out starting to build it on
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:39.420]   actually didn't wind up continuing on.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:45.420]   That isn't exactly what he planned on.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.420]   He started off with saying,
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:49.420]   "Okay, I'm going to talk about finance,"
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.420]   and then it grew into so much more.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.420]   So just get started and learn something.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.420]   Learn something.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.420]   Next, he kept his expenses low.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.420]   This is how financial planning interacts,
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:01.420]   and this is how the technical details
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.420]   of financial planning interact.
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:06.420]   He kept his expenses low, and he built savings.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.420]   So he had something to go on,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   and he didn't inflate his life.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   And because he didn't inflate his lifestyle,
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:16.420]   that puts very little pressure on a business.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.420]   Now, if you already need $25,000 a month
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:20.420]   to maintain your lifestyle, that's fine.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.420]   We can still figure something out.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   But if you only need $2,000 a month to live on,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.420]   because you're a single guy like he is
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:29.420]   and you kept your lifestyle fairly moderate,
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:34.420]   that's what an amazing--
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:35.420]   it just sets you up.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   So he kept his expenses low.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.420]   He built his savings, and that allowed him--
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   he launched when the time was right.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   So as his job shut down
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.420]   and he got into a difficult situation, he left.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.420]   And then once he left,
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.420]   he continued focusing on his skills and his learning.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.420]   And that was what I was so impressed with
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.420]   about meeting Craig at the Podcast Movement Conference
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.420]   is that he was already earning
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:01.420]   a good amount of money from his consulting work.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.420]   He was able to help me with a couple of things
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.420]   just while we were sitting there talking at the conference.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.420]   Oh, and here's how cool it is
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.420]   when you can get these things integrated.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:11.420]   So he went to Dallas for the Podcast Movement Conference.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.420]   He had a client in Dallas,
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:15.420]   a web client that he consults for from up in Minneapolis--
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.420]   or not Minneapolis.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.420]   He lives in Minnesota somewhere.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.420]   So from up in Minnesota,
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.420]   he was consulting with his client in Dallas.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.420]   He was able to stay with the client, I think,
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.420]   if my memory is correct,
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.420]   which saved him money while he was there in Dallas,
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.420]   writes off the trip to Dallas as a business expense,
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.420]   writes off the cost of the conference as a business expense,
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.420]   and writes off 'cause he's there visiting his client,
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.420]   helping his client out with some work there.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.420]   And that's how you can use the tax planning stuff
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.420]   and the business stuff
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.420]   and integrate that into what I'm sure
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.420]   was an enjoyable trip for him that he enjoyed.
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:47.420]   Business conferences are not all humdrum and boring,
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.420]   even when they're legitimate.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   They're not all humdrum and boring.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.420]   I'm not talking about taking some silly cruise
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.420]   where you do ten minutes of learning and try to write that off.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.420]   That doesn't fly.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.420]   But, I mean, a legitimate conference.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:03.420]   Craig went to that conference,
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.420]   and we were just standing around talking.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.420]   We were standing there talking, I think, at the FinCon table.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:12.420]   Philip Taylor, who writes at the blog PT Money,
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   part-time money,
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.420]   he had a table there 'cause he lives in Dallas,
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.420]   and he had a table there advertising the FinCon conference.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:22.420]   That gave those of us who were at the Podcast Movement conference
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.420]   a cool opportunity just to have a place to--
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.420]   who were in the financial world,
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.420]   who were there at the Podcast Movement conference--
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.420]   a cool place to congregate and talk.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.420]   So I think Philip Taylor introduced me to Craig.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.420]   We got to talking.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:38.420]   We hit it off, and we had a good 30, 45-minute, 60-minute talk.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.420]   I skipped the sessions and sat there and chatted with him.
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.420]   Well, the cool thing is that, A, I made a new friend.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.420]   B, I found an interviewee for my show.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:52.420]   C, I found someone who knows what he's doing with the financial stuff
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.420]   and with the WordPress stuff,
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.420]   and so we're going to try to work together.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   We were talking after we hung up the call,
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   and we were talking, and we were going to try to--
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:02.420]   he's going to try to help me out.
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.420]   So I need some help on the technical aspects of this show.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.420]   I'm not a techie as far as web stuff,
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:09.420]   and he's pretty good at that, and that's what his business is.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.420]   So we're going to try to see if we can start working together
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:14.420]   and helping each other to grow.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.420]   So he's got a new client out of it,
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:20.420]   and we'll see as far as how our business relationship develops.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:21.420]   But who knows?
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.420]   He could make back the cost of his conference many-fold
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.420]   just from one relationship,
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:31.420]   and I know that a lot of other business came out of that for him as well.
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:37.420]   So that's why things like conferences can be such a win-win,
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   which is why they're part of that 1,000% formula.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.420]   I think--oh, last--oh, I was going to say,
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.420]   that's all I wanted to share on the Craig interview.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.420]   I do have one more thing real quick,
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.420]   and then I'm going to give you just a quick update on the show,
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.420]   what you can expect for the month of September,
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   and then we're out of here for today.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.420]   After we were talking, after we hung up from the Skype call,
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.420]   then was talking with Craig, and he was saying,
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.420]   "Oh, man, I forgot we should have set up something."
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.420]   So we talked and we figured it out,
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   and we decided to set up something just for you, the audience,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   for him coming on.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:17.420]   Craig runs at his site, which is www.createmyindependence.com.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:21.420]   At his site, he has a blog, he has a podcast,
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.420]   and he's got some courses that he does.
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:29.420]   He's got some resources and some webinars about building his site.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.420]   And so what he decided to do is to offer a webinar
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.420]   for the Radical Personal Finance audience.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.420]   It's going to be a live webinar.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.420]   He sent me the date.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.420]   He's going to do it on Monday, September 8th,
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:44.420]   in the evening at 9 Eastern, 8 Central,
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.420]   if you're in the United States.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:54.420]   Go to www.createmyindependence.com/rpf.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:58.420]   www.createmy--he told me you've got to get the www in there.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.420]   createmyindependence.com/rpf for Radical Personal Finance.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.420]   And he's going to be doing a webinar called
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:10.420]   "The 7 Steps to Creating and Growing a Business from Your Blog."
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.420]   And so this is some of his learnings.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.420]   You can see what he's done.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.420]   He's created and grown a business from his blog.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:20.420]   And I spent some time talking with him.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.420]   He's done a lot of studies, done a lot of research,
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.420]   and I think that would be a really great opportunity.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.420]   And he's developed a course from it.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.420]   He showed me what he will present in the webinar,
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   sent me a copy of it.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   I think it's going to be an awesome information for free.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:39.420]   And he's got a course at the end of it that he sells as well
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.420]   that will have more information.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.420]   So if you're interested in that webinar, make sure to check it out.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:48.420]   It's at www.createmyindependence.com/rpf.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:52.420]   It really looks like a good offering.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.420]   He sent me the info to the course here to check it out
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:58.420]   and see what his course is that he sells.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   I'm going to check that out myself
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   and see if I can get some tips out of there.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.420]   So that's it for the interview.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.420]   Last thing, update on the show.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.420]   I want to thank you guys for listening.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:11.420]   It was an awesome month last month.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:15.420]   We doubled the listenership from the first month of the show here,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.420]   which was July.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:22.420]   So last month, August, we wound up with 42,838 downloads of the show.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.420]   And that was just awesome.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:27.420]   And last week we've averaged almost 2,000 downloads a day,
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.420]   which is tremendous.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.420]   I have gotten so much good feedback from you guys.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.420]   I have e-mails, the reviews, things like that.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.420]   Like I told you last week, we wound up--we were able to hit the front page of iTunes,
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   which was a really cool--I never could have dreamed of that.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.420]   So I thank each and every one of you who is listening.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   I thank each and every one of you who has told a friend.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.420]   I would ask you, if you've enjoyed this, tell a friend.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   That would be how we can continue to grow the show.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:59.420]   And that's my dream is to grow the show and help people.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:04.420]   And the more we can grow it, the more we can figure out some way that it can free me up
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.420]   to spend more time tightening things up, doing a better job editing the shows,
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   doing a better job being very concise.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.420]   And it's just been so far so good.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.420]   It's been awesome.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.420]   And so I just want to thank you for that.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.420]   Here in the month of September, I'm going to be traveling for the last two weeks of September.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:24.420]   So normal shows this week and next week I'll be in town with normal shows.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   I've got a bunch of interviews lined up.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.420]   And then I will be gone from the 15th through the end of the month.
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:32.420]   I'm going to do my best to leave you some shows during that time.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:36.420]   I'll be going out to New Orleans for FinCon, FinCon '14 in New Orleans,
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:38.420]   which is formerly the Financial Bloggers Conference.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:40.420]   It will be really interesting.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:46.420]   And then the week after that, I will be up in Pennsylvania at the American College
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.420]   where I will be finishing--this is the final requirement for my master's degree
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:53.420]   in financial planning, which is something I've been wanting to finish up.
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   But I've got to go up there for a residency requirement, and then I will be back.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.420]   I will do my best to leave you with shows during that time.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:02.420]   What I expect to do is I expect to leave you with some interview shows
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.420]   that hopefully I'll be able to record between now and the time I leave for New Orleans.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:09.420]   And then I will also leave you with some other shows that will be prerecorded
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.420]   and also including hopefully some book reviews.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:15.420]   I'm going to do some book reviews for you guys of some of my books that I really like,
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.420]   books that I didn't, and leave that for you.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:21.420]   And they'll probably be shorter, maybe so, maybe not.
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:22.420]   I haven't recorded them yet.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:27.420]   But that will give you something to listen to while I'm gone for those two weeks in September.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:30.420]   And I just want to say, again, thank you.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   Appreciate each and every one of you.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   Cheers.
