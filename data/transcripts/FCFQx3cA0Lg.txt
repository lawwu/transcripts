[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.000]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.080]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.460]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.960]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.760]   Today, we're going to explore hormones, what they are,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.720]   how they work, what leads to masculinization
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.700]   or feminization of the brain and body.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.860]   What we're trying to do today is really get to the biology,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.800]   the physiology, the endocrinology, and the behavior.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   Hormones, by definition, are a substance,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.600]   a chemical that's released in one area of the body,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.800]   typically from something we call a gland,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.240]   although they can also be released from neurons,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.640]   but they're released often from glands
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.960]   that travel and have effects both on that gland,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.280]   but also on other organs and tissues in the body.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.940]   And that differentiates hormones
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.700]   from things like neurotransmitters,
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.040]   which tend to act more locally.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.120]   Examples of tissues that produce hormones
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.520]   would be the thyroid, the testes, the ovaries, et cetera.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.160]   And then, of course, there are areas of the brain
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.280]   like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.000]   which are closely related to one another
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.080]   and release hormones that cause the release
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.040]   of yet other hormones out in the body.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.000]   So let's start with development.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280]   Sperm meets egg.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   Everything that happens before that
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.860]   is a topic of the next episode.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.160]   But sperm meets egg, this is mammalian reproduction,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.840]   and that egg starts to duplicate.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.520]   It starts to make more of itself.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.640]   It makes more cells.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   And eventually some of those cells become skin,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.000]   some of those cells become brain,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.400]   some of those cells become muscle,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.340]   some of those cells become fingers,
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.440]   all the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.500]   In addition, there are hormones that come
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.880]   both from the mother and from the developing baby,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.140]   the developing fetus,
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.900]   that impact whether or not the brain will be
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.580]   what they call organized masculine or organized feminine.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.260]   And as I say this,
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.700]   I want you to try and discard with the cultural connotations
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.500]   or your psychological connotations
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.540]   of what masculinization and feminization are,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.900]   because we're only centering on the biology.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.900]   So typically people have either two X chromosomes,
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.980]   and the traditional language around that
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.780]   is that person is female, right?
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.400]   Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.660]   and that person will become male.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.380]   Now, it's not always the case.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.100]   There are cases where it's XXY,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.820]   where there are two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.340]   There are also cases where it's XYY,
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.980]   where there are two Y chromosomes.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.300]   And these have important biological
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.060]   and psychological impacts.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.860]   So the first thing we need to establish
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.900]   is that there is something called chromosomal sex,
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.580]   whether or not they're two X chromosomes
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.580]   or an X and Y chromosome is what we call chromosomal sex.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.900]   But the next stage of separating out the sexes
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.020]   is what we call gonadal sex.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.780]   Typically, not always,
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.420]   but typically if somebody has testes for their gonads,
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.800]   we think of them as male.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.700]   And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female,
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.060]   although that's not always the case either.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.740]   But let's just explore the transition
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.780]   from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex,
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.580]   because it's a fascinating one
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.900]   that we all went through in some form or another.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.580]   So this XY that we typically think of
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.780]   as promoting masculinization of the fetus,
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   we say that because on the Y chromosome, there are genes,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.660]   and those genes have particular functions
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.020]   that suppress female reproductive organs.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.160]   So on the Y chromosome, there's a gene
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.180]   which encodes for something called
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.440]   mullerian inhibiting hormone.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.700]   So there's actually a hormone
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.960]   that's programmed by the Y chromosome
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.820]   that inhibits the formation of mullerian ducts,
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.980]   which are an important part
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.260]   of the female reproductive apparatus.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.460]   That's critical because already we're seeing the transition
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.940]   between chromosome, Y chromosome and gonad.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.960]   And other genes on the Y chromosome
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.180]   promote the formation of testes.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.220]   So there are genes like the SRY gene
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.780]   and other genes that promote the formation of testes
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.140]   while they also inhibit the formation of the mullerian ducts.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.740]   So the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.100]   is a very important distinction.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.700]   It's kind of a fork in the road
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.580]   that happens very early in development
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.220]   while fetuses are still in the embryo.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.300]   So we have to distinguish between chromosomal sex,
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.680]   gonadal sex, and then there's what we call hormonal sex,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.300]   which is the effects of the steroid hormones,
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.100]   estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.940]   on what we call morphological sex
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.780]   or the shape of the baby and the human and the genitalia
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.620]   and the jaw and all these other things.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.940]   And so it actually is quite complicated.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.140]   So it's a long distance from chromosomes to gender identity
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.700]   and gender identity has a lot of social influences and roles.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.900]   This is an area that right now is very dynamic
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.100]   and in the discussion out there, as you know,
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.140]   but just getting from chromosomal sex
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.100]   to what we would call gonadal sex and hormonal sex
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.900]   and morphological sex involves a number of steps.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.180]   So today we're going to talk about those steps.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.980]   And there's some fascinating things
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.640]   that do indeed relate to tools,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.540]   do indeed relate to some important behavioral choices,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.320]   important choices about things to avoid while pregnant.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.100]   And for those of you that are not pregnant,
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.660]   things to avoid if you're thinking
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.700]   about eventually having children,
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.660]   and that is not to drive development
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.940]   in one direction or another,
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.740]   but there are examples where there are some deleterious
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.460]   things in our environment that can actually negatively
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.500]   impact what we call sexual development overall,
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.620]   regardless of chromosomal background.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.260]   So let's get started with that.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.340]   Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.960]   Hormones generally have two categories of effects.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.660]   They can either be very fast or they can be very slow.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.400]   There are hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.880]   which act very fast.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.700]   And then there are hormones like testosterone and estrogen,
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.340]   which we refer to as the sex steroid hormones.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.180]   These molecules, for those of you that are interested,
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.540]   are what are called lipophilic,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.220]   which just means that they like fatty stuff.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.120]   They can actually pass through fatty membranes.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.460]   And because the outside of cells,
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.540]   as well as what's called the nuclear envelope,
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.700]   where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.620]   are made of lipid, of fat,
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.500]   these steroid hormones can actually travel into cells
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.740]   and then interact with the DNA of cells
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.380]   in order to control gene expression.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.000]   So they can change the sorts of things
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.340]   that cells will become,
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.220]   and they can change the way that cells function
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.460]   in a long-term way.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.700]   And that's actually how the presence of these genes,
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.480]   like SRY and Mullerian inhibiting hormone,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.620]   lead to reductions or elimination, I should say,
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.260]   of things like the Mullerian ducts
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.220]   and promote instead what's called in males,
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.020]   the Wolfian ducts,
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.340]   or promote the development of testes rather than ovaries.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.440]   So all you need to know is that hormones have short-term
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.420]   and long-term effects.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.840]   And the long-term effects are actually related
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.680]   to their effects on genes
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.340]   and how those genes are expressed or repressed,
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.220]   not in order to prevent them
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.100]   from having particular proteins made.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.880]   So these hormones, these steroid hormones,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.100]   are exceedingly powerful.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.980]   And if we're going to have a discussion
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.800]   about masculinization or feminization, et cetera,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.340]   you also need to think about the counterpart.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.300]   It's not just about masculinizing the body
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.860]   or feminizing the body and brain,
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.100]   it's also about demasculinizing the brain in many cases
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.000]   as a normal biological function,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.840]   typically of XX females.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.780]   And defeminization, the suppression of certain pathways
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.260]   that are related to feminization of the body and brain.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.740]   So I've just thrown a lot of biology at you,
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.780]   but this is where it all starts
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.280]   to get incredibly surprising.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.900]   You would think that it's straightforward, right?
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.020]   You have a Y chromosome,
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.140]   you suppress the female reproductive pathway,
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.420]   like the Mullerian ducts,
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.180]   you promote the development of testes
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.340]   and then testes make testosterone.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.460]   And then it organizes the brain male
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.940]   and it wants to do male-like things.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.480]   And then in females, you get estrogen
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.580]   and it wants to do a female-like things
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.880]   and air quotes here for all of this.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.220]   And it turns out that isn't how it works at all.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.220]   Here's where it's interesting.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.780]   We have to understand that there are effects
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.420]   of these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.460]   on what are called primary sexual characteristics,
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.260]   which are the ones that you're born with,
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260]   secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.940]   which are the ones that show up in puberty.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.800]   And these are happening in the brain
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.620]   and body and spinal cord.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.260]   And so I'm going to disentangle all this for you
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.220]   by giving you some examples.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.720]   First, let's talk about the development
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.580]   of primary sexual characteristics,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.780]   the ones that show up at birth.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.980]   And one of the more dramatic examples of this,
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.620]   it comes from the role of testosterone
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.020]   in creating the external genitalia.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.940]   It turns out that it's not testosterone
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.280]   that's responsible for the development of the penis
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.380]   in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.260]   It's a different androgen.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.380]   Androgen is just a category of hormones
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.620]   that includes testosterone,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.040]   but testosterone is converted in the fetus
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.660]   to something called dihydrotestosterone.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.900]   And that's accomplished through an enzyme
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.660]   called 5-alpha reductase.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.940]   Dihydrotestosterone is what we would call
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.420]   the dominant androgen in males.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.940]   It's responsible for aggression.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.800]   It's responsible for a lot of muscular strength.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.260]   It's involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.660]   We're going to talk about all of that,
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.180]   but dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.160]   in determining the genitalia
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.300]   while the baby is still in the embryo.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.380]   So there's testosterone that's made
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.900]   and that testosterone gets converted
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.440]   by this enzyme 5-alpha reductase
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.740]   in a little structure called the tubercle.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.740]   That tubercle will eventually become the penis.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.480]   So you say, okay, straightforward.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.500]   This testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.780]   And then if there's dihydrotestosterone,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.380]   it controls penis growth.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.420]   And indeed that's the case.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.940]   So that's a primary sexual characteristic.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.160]   That baby will then grow up.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.220]   And later during puberty,
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.860]   there will be the release of a molecule.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.380]   I talked about this last episode called kispeptin,
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.980]   K-I-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kispeptin,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.920]   which will cause the release of some other hormones,
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.180]   connatural releasing hormone,
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.820]   luteinizing hormone will stimulate the testes
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.880]   to make testosterone.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.000]   So in puberty,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.540]   testosterone leads to further growth
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.980]   and development of the penis,
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.300]   as well as the accumulation of,
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.740]   or growth of pubic hair, deepening of the voice,
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.100]   all the secondary sexual characteristics.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.960]   There's a very interesting phenomenon
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.100]   that was published in the journal science in the 1970s,
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.500]   for which now there's a wealth of scientific data.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.340]   And this relates to a genetic mutation
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.620]   where five alpha reductase,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.060]   the enzyme that converts testosterone
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.900]   to dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.820]   It's mutated.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.060]   And this actually was first identified
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.680]   in the Dominican Republic.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.460]   What happens is baby is born.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.940]   If you were to look at that baby,
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.060]   it would look female.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.500]   There would be very little or no external penis.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.840]   And what was observed is that from time to time,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.940]   that baby, after being raised as a girl,
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.660]   would around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.700]   would start to sprout a penis.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.860]   There's actually a name for this.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.420]   It's called cuevedosis,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.220]   which the translation is more or less penis at 12.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.780]   And as strange as this might sound,
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.700]   it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.140]   What happens in these children,
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.620]   these cuevedosis is that the child is born.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.620]   It has testes, which are not descended.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.220]   So up in the body,
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.620]   they weren't able to convert testosterone
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.820]   to dihydrotestosterone
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.520]   because they lack this enzyme five alpha reductase.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.740]   As a consequence,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.560]   the primary sexual characteristic
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   of external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.420]   And then what happens is the baby grows up
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.780]   and then testosterone starts getting secreted
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.520]   from the testes 'cause cispeptin in the brain
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.860]   signals through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.100]   travels down to the testes.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.180]   The testes start churning out testosterone
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.620]   and there's a secondary growth of the penis.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.900]   And all of a sudden there's a penis.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.900]   And the point here is that dihydrotestosterone,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   not testosterone is responsible
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.180]   for this primary growth of the penis.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.420]   And that testosterone later is involved
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.740]   in the secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.660]   deepening in the voice, et cetera.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.900]   Now, this is where the information
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.900]   gets even more interesting
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.660]   and applies to essentially everybody.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.780]   You might think that testosterone,
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.140]   because it masculinizes the body
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.080]   in the secondary sexual characteristic way,
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.040]   and because dihydrotestosterone, another androgen,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.540]   masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.160]   the growth of the penis early on,
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.520]   that testosterone must masculinize the brain.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.040]   But the masculinization of the brain
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.000]   is not accomplished by testosterone.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.060]   It is accomplished by estrogen.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.160]   Testosterone can be converted into estrogen
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.480]   by an enzyme called aromatase.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.820]   There are neurons in the brain that make aromatase
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.220]   and convert testosterone into estrogen.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.620]   In other words, it's estrogen
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.940]   that masculinizes the XY individual
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.020]   that masculinizes the brain.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.460]   And this has profound effects on all sorts of things,
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.700]   on behavior, on outlook in the world, et cetera.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.060]   But I think most people don't realize
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.980]   that it's estrogen that comes from testosterone
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.180]   that masculinizes the male brain,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.080]   the XY brain, not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.160]   So I just want to mention some tools.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.440]   You might be asking yourself,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.340]   how could tools possibly come up
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.820]   at this stage of the conversation
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.040]   where we're talking about sexual development
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.260]   and we're talking about the differentiation
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.360]   of tissues in the body?
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.680]   Well, this is true both for children and parents and adults.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.600]   I want to emphasize that there are things
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.640]   that are environmental,
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.880]   and there are things that people use
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   that actually can impact hormone levels
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.640]   and can impact sexual development in fairly profound ways.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.480]   And I want to be very clear,
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.360]   this is not me pulling from some rare journal,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.480]   I've never heard of it.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.240]   This is pulling from textbooks in particular.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   Today, I'm guiding a lot of the conversation
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.400]   on work that on behavioral endocrinology.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.080]   This is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance Crigfield,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.900]   true experts in the field.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.360]   I'm going to talk about some of the work from Tyrone Hayes
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.840]   from UC Berkeley about environmental toxins
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.600]   and their impacts on some of these things
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.660]   like testosterone and estrogen.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.180]   I'm going to touch into them.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.180]   I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.560]   that's grounded in studies,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.420]   which we will provide in the caption
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.700]   or that I'll reference here.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.740]   You know, again, I'm just going to highlight
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.460]   when one starts talking about environmental factors
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.660]   and how they're poisoning us
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.340]   or disrupting growth or fertility rates,
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.620]   it can start to sound a little bit crazy,
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.300]   except when you start to actually look
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.800]   at some of the real data,
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.860]   data from quality research labs
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.800]   funded by federal government,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.500]   funded not from companies or other sources
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.820]   that are really aimed at understanding
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.500]   what the underlying biology is.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.420]   And for that, I really,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.020]   we should all be grateful to Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.520]   I remember way back when I was a graduate student
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.500]   in the late nineties, goodness, at UC Berkeley.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.700]   And I remember him, he was studying frogs.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.780]   He was talking about developmental defects
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.620]   in these frogs that live in different waters around,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.300]   it was California, but also elsewhere.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.980]   And he identified a substance which is present
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.260]   in a lot of waterways throughout this country
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.100]   and other countries, so US and beyond,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.140]   certainly not just restricted California,
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.580]   which is atrazine, this is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.260]   Again, this is the stuff of textbooks
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.980]   and it causes severe testicular malformations.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.140]   So again, atrazine exposure is serious.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.520]   And what's interesting is if you look at the data,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.120]   what you find is that at sites in Western
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.220]   and Midwestern sections of the United States,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.860]   10 to 92% of male frogs, these were frogs, mind you,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.860]   had testicular abnormalities.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.020]   And the most severe testicular malformations
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.760]   were in the testes rather than in the sperm.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.680]   So it's actually the organ itself, the gonad itself.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.580]   Now, it's very well known now
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.100]   that atrazine is in many herbicides.
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.580]   And so, whereas I would say in the '80s and '90s,
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.060]   the discussion around herbicides and their negative effects
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.020]   was considered kind of like hippie-dippie stuff
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.460]   or the stuff you hear about at your local community markets
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.260]   and these kind of new agey communities,
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.080]   now there's very solid data from federally funded labs
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.580]   at major universities that have been peer reviewed
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.720]   and published in excellent journals,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.940]   showing that indeed many of these herbicides
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.180]   can have negative effects primarily by impacting
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.540]   the ratios of these hormones in either the mothers
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.540]   or in the testes, altering the testes of the fathers,
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.980]   or direct effects on developing young animals
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.060]   and potentially humans.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.880]   And so you ask, well, what about humans?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.860]   Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.500]   So here are the data on what's happening.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.140]   And this isn't all going to be scary stuff.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.440]   We're also going to talk about tools to ameliorate
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.400]   and offset some of these effects, depending on your needs.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.540]   But across human populations,
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.180]   sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:45.060]   So in 1940, the average density of human sperm
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.180]   was 113 million per milliliter of semen.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.020]   That's how it's measured.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.340]   How many sperm per milliliter of semen?
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.540]   In 1990, this figure has dropped to 66.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.940]   It went from 113 million per milliliter
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.000]   to 66 million per milliliter
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.100]   in the United States and Western Europe.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.600]   So it's not just a US thing.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.380]   Researchers also estimated that the volume of semen
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.140]   produced by men has dropped 20% in that time,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.100]   reduced sperm count per ejaculation even further.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.380]   So between 1981 and 1991,
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.860]   the ratio of normal spermatogenesis has decreased
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.860]   from 56.4% to 26.9%.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.260]   So there's a lot that's happening primarily
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.160]   because of these herbicides that are in widespread use
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.780]   to reduce sperm counts.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.680]   And these are going to have profound effects,
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.620]   not just on sperm counts, but on development,
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.620]   sexual development at the level of the gonads and the brain,
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.900]   because you need testosterone to get dihydrotestosterone
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.420]   for primary sexual characteristics.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.300]   You need estrogen that's come from testosterone
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.460]   to masculinize the brain.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.900]   And of course,
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.940]   we're not just focusing on sperm and testosterone.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.660]   You, of course, also know that many of these herbicides
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.900]   are disrupting estrogens in a similar way,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.540]   which might explain why puberty is happening
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.860]   so much earlier in young girls these days.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.660]   So there are a lot of things that are happening.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.900]   Now, does this mean that you have to run around
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.860]   and neurotically avoid anything that includes things
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.040]   like atrazine?
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.580]   And should you be avoiding all kinds of herbicides?
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.240]   I don't know, that's up to you,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.420]   but it does seem that these have pretty marked effects
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.860]   in both the animal studies and in the human studies.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.120]   So let's talk about female sexual development.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.300]   And as always, what we'll do
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.800]   is we'll talk about the normal biology.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.080]   Then we'll talk a little bit about a kind of extraordinary
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.940]   or unusual set of cases,
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.300]   but we'll talk about them
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.860]   because they illustrate an important principle
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.820]   about how things work under typical circumstances.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.340]   So there is a mutation
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.100]   called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.140]   And understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.860]   can help you really understand
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.940]   how hormones impact sexual development.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.620]   So here's how it works.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.200]   There are individuals who are X, Y,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.600]   so they have a Y chromosome,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.420]   that are born, that make testosterone.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.340]   They have testes and they don't have mullerian ducts
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.360]   because on the Y chromosome
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.520]   is this mullerian inhibiting hormone.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.720]   However, these individuals look completely female.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.500]   And in general, they report feeling like girls
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.440]   when they're young, women when they're older.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.060]   But there's something unusual that's happening
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.020]   in these individuals
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.020]   because they have an X, Y chromosomal type and not XX.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.700]   So what's happening?
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.100]   Well, what's happening is the testes are making testosterone,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.540]   but the receptor for testosterone is mutated.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.860]   And therefore the testes never descend.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.260]   They don't have ovaries, they have testes,
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.060]   but the testes are internal.
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.100]   And so typically these individuals find out
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.060]   that they are actually X, Y chromosomes
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.020]   so that their chromosomal sex is male, if you will,
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.740]   and their gonadal sex is male,
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.120]   but the gonads, the testes are inside the body,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.100]   they don't actually develop a scrotum,
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.180]   they don't make ovaries.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.340]   And when they don't menstruate around the time of puberty,
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.340]   that's a sign that something is different.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.040]   And so they never menstruate around puberty.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.460]   And if they look into this deeply enough,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.500]   what you find is that they are actually X, Y,
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   they make testosterone,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.580]   but their body can't make use of the testosterone
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.060]   because they don't have the receptors.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.060]   And the receptors are vitally important
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.300]   for most all of the secondary sexual characteristics
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.180]   that we talked about,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.860]   body hair, penis growth during puberty, et cetera.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.620]   So again, we're talking about this
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.940]   in order to illustrate the principle
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.060]   that in order to have its effects,
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.460]   a hormone doesn't just have to be present,
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.740]   that hormone actually has to be able to bind its receptor
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.540]   and take action on the target cells.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.980]   Perhaps the simplest way to understand
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.260]   how estrogen and testosterone impact masculinization
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.700]   or feminization of the brain and behavior
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.620]   is from a statement.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.020]   It's actually the closing sentence of an abstract
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.440]   that my colleague Niral Shah
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine published,
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.500]   which is that estrogen,
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.860]   again, it's estrogen that is aromatized from testosterone
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.620]   by aromatase,
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.140]   sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.580]   and in animals and in humans, territorial behaviors.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.900]   So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.380]   Estrogen does that.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.580]   Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.180]   and testosterone is then what controls
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.860]   the display of those behaviors later in life.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.020]   And I find that incredibly interesting.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.020]   You would think it was just testosterone did one thing
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.420]   and estrogen did another,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.020]   but it turns out that nature
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.340]   is far more interesting than that.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.700]   Okay, so what are some things
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.500]   that impact sexual development early in life
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.680]   and later in life?
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.300]   Let's talk about cannabis.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.380]   Let's talk about alcohol.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.500]   First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.660]   There are many studies that point to the fact
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.940]   that THC and other things in cannabis
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.940]   promote significant increases in aromatase activity.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.580]   Now, pot smokers aren't going to like this,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.740]   especially male pot smokers aren't going to like this,
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.940]   but it's the reality.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.760]   Here's the deal, that cannabis,
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.300]   and it's not clear if it's THC itself
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.100]   or other elements in the marijuana plant
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.220]   promote aromatase activity.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.840]   Now, this has been observed anecdotally
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.380]   where pot smokers have a higher incidence
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.260]   of developing something I mentioned before,
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.300]   gynecomastia, breast bud development,
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.420]   or full-blown breast development in males.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.300]   Now, earlier I said that estrogen
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.280]   is what masculinizes the male brain.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.880]   In utero, that's true,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.820]   but the way that cannabis seems to work,
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.340]   at least from the studies I was able to identify,
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.900]   is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.860]   and therefore can counteract
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.880]   some of the masculinizing effects
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.900]   of things like testosterone
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.300]   and dihydrotestosterone
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.060]   on primary and secondary sexual characteristics.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.940]   So I mentioned this because, you know,
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.380]   I think nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.180]   and certainly during puberty,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.460]   it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.420]   And so we'll do another episode
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.580]   that goes really deep into this,
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.940]   but yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.980]   by increasing aromatase.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.540]   Most everyone can appreciate
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.380]   that drinking during pregnancy
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.240]   is not good for the developing fetus.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.340]   Fetal alcohol syndrome
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.340]   is a well-established negative outcome of pregnancy,
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.220]   and it's something that there are cognitive effects
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.540]   that are really bad.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.160]   There's actually physical malformation, et cetera.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.840]   So drinking during pregnancy, not good.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.020]   Probably drinking during puberty, not good either,
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.400]   because alcohol, in particular,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.380]   certain things like beer,
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.380]   but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.260]   Now, this isn't just about protecting young boys
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.620]   from estrogenic activity.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.120]   It's also protecting girls from excessive
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   or even hypoestrogenic effects of alcohol in puberty.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.040]   Now, many teenagers drink, college students drink,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.320]   and it's important to point out
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   that puberty doesn't start on one day
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.080]   and end on another day.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.400]   Puberty has a beginning, a middle, and an end,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.240]   but development is really our entire lifespan.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.840]   Okay, so we talked about cannabis.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.600]   We talked about alcohol.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Let's talk about cell phones.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   First of all, I use a cell phone.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.000]   I use it very often,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.120]   and I do not think they are evil devices.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.680]   I think that they require some discipline
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.160]   in order to make sure
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.960]   that it does not become a negative force in one's life.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.980]   So I personally restrict the number of hours
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.440]   that I'm on the phone and in particular on social media.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.120]   But what about the cell phone itself?
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.960]   When I was a junior professor,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.560]   I was a pre-tenure early professor,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.880]   I taught this class on neural circuits
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.280]   and health and disease.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.440]   And one of the students asked me,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.720]   "Are cell phones safe for the brain?"
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.440]   And all the data point to the fact that they were,
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.560]   or at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.360]   I still don't have the answer on that, frankly.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.640]   I'm not personally aware of any evidence
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.400]   in quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.700]   showing that cell phones are bad for the brain,
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.700]   or that holding the phone to the ear is bad,
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.540]   or that Bluetooth is bad, or any of that.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.440]   I'm just not aware of any quality studies.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   However, I was very interested in a particular study
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   that was published back in 2013 on rats.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.960]   It was basically took a cell phone
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.580]   and put it under a cage of rats,
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.940]   and looked at basically testicular
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.360]   and ovarian development in rats,
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   and saw minor, but still statistically significant defects
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.420]   in ovarian and testicular development.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.840]   Since then, and now returning to the literature,
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.800]   I've seen a absolute explosion of studies,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.040]   some of which are in quality journals,
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.720]   some of which are in what I would call
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.160]   not blue ribbon journals,
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.880]   identifying defects in testicular
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.260]   and/or ovarian development by mere exposure
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.560]   to cell phone emitted waves, let's just call that.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.760]   We don't know what they are.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.300]   And this sounds almost crazy, right?
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.200]   Anytime somebody starts talking about EMFs
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.280]   and things like that, you kind of worry,
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.660]   like, is this person okay?
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.020]   But look, the literature are pointing in a direction
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:09.020]   where chronic exposure of the gonads to cell phones
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.200]   could be creating serious issues
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.280]   in terms of the health at the cellular level,
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.680]   and in terms of the output.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   So the output for the testes would be sperm production,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.340]   swimming speed in sperm is an important feature
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.560]   of sperm health.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.420]   In the ovaries, it would be estrogenic output,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.820]   how regular the cycles are.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.200]   I think that it's fair to say, based on the literature,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.760]   that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.360]   on gonadal development.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.760]   The question is, what is the proximity of the cell phone
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.600]   to the gonads?
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.140]   So you have to take these sorts of studies
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.300]   with a grain of salt.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.080]   There's some interesting effects of hormones
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.520]   that actually you can observe on the outside of people
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.860]   that tell you something about,
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.800]   not just their level of hormones,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.240]   but also about their underlying genetics.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.800]   And these relate to beard growth and baldness.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.280]   And it's fascinating.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.680]   The molecule, the hormone, dihydrotestosterone,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.000]   made from testosterone,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.680]   is the hormone primarily responsible for facial hair,
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.640]   for beard growth.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.200]   As well, it's the molecule, the hormone,
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.560]   primarily responsible for lack of hair on the head,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.020]   for hair loss.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.160]   Not incidentally, the drugs that are designed
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   to prevent hair loss are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.880]   So remember 5-alpha-reductase from the huevidosis?
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.280]   Well, the people that discovered the huevidosis
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.000]   went on to do a lot of research
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.840]   on the underlying biochemistry
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.280]   of this really interesting molecule, dihydrotestosterone,
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.500]   the identified 5-alpha-reductase.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.080]   And 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.880]   are the basis of most of the anti-hair loss treatments
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.440]   that are out there.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.040]   And so there are some interesting things here.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.780]   First of all, the side effect profiles
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.840]   of those treatments for hair loss
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.000]   are quite severe in many individuals.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.560]   Remember, DHT is the primary androgen for libido,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.280]   for strength and connective tissue repair,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.800]   for aggression, even if that aggression,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.340]   of course, is held in check,
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.280]   but just sort of ambition and aggression
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.360]   is related to dopamine,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.720]   but within the testosterone pathway,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.840]   less so pure testosterone,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.600]   although pure testosterone has its effects,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.120]   but DHT is, at least in primate species, including humans,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.820]   is the dominant androgen
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.360]   for most of those sorts of effects.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.280]   And if you look at somebody,
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.720]   everyone can predict whether or not they're going to go bald
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.040]   based on looking at their,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.000]   we're always taught, our mother's father.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.360]   So if your mother's father was bald,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.200]   there's a higher probability that you're going to go bald.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.700]   The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.600]   will dictate whether or not
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.280]   you're going to go bald everywhere,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.940]   or just in the front, or so-called crown-type baldness.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.520]   And the density of the beard
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.640]   tells you about the density of DHT receptors.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.880]   Now, this varies by background, by genetic background.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.000]   There are areas of the world
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.680]   where all the men seem to be,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.960]   have the same pattern of baldness,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.680]   like a strip of baldness down the center,
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.000]   with hair still on the sides and full beards.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.120]   That's because these patterns of DHT receptors
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.960]   are genetically determined.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.680]   Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still be very high.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.480]   DHT levels in the blood can be very high,
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.240]   and yet people will have very light beards or no beards,
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.860]   and that's because they don't have
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.360]   a lot of DHT receptors in the face.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   There are a lot of effects of DHT
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.440]   that you can just see in male phenotypes.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.360]   And it's interesting that these hair loss drugs
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.000]   that are, or to prevent hair loss drugs,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.360]   are directly aimed at preventing
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.000]   the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.040]   and that's why they, to some extent, prevent hair loss,
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.480]   but also, to some extent, have a bunch of side effects
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.220]   that are associated with low DHT.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.020]   I want to tell you a story about hyenas
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.440]   and clitorises the size of penises.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.900]   So when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.220]   we had a professor in our department,
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.000]   phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Steve Glickman had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.040]   that lived within caged enclosures, of course,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.700]   in Tilden Park, behind the UC Berkeley campus.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.340]   The hyenas are no longer there.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.540]   Hyenas exhibit an incredible feature to their body,
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.860]   their hormones, and their social structure.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.900]   Hyenas, unlike many species,
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.260]   have a situation with their genitalia
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.700]   where the male penis is actually smaller
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.180]   than the female clitoris.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.460]   And I should say that the male penis itself,
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.080]   having seen a fair number of hyena penises,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.960]   is not particularly small,
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   which means that the hyena clitorises are extremely large.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.480]   This was well-known for some time.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.020]   It turns out that in the spotted hyenas,
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.280]   the females are dominant.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.800]   So after a kill, the females will eat,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.480]   then their young will eat,
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.100]   and then the male hyenas will eat.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.300]   As well, when the female hyena gives birth,
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.340]   she gives birth not through the vaginal canal
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.700]   that we're accustomed to seeing,
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   but through a very enlarged clitoris-like phallus,
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.940]   although it's not a phallus, it's a clitoris,
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.900]   and it literally splits open.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.620]   So many fetuses die
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.380]   during the course of hyena development and birth.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:59.240]   The baby hyena actually comes through the tissue,
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.960]   and it's a very traumatic birth.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   It was a mystery as to how the female hyenas have this,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.380]   we'll call it masculinization,
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.440]   but it's really a androgenization
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.960]   of the periphery of the genitalia.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.920]   And it turns out, through a lot of careful research
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.480]   done by Steve Glickman, Christine Dre, and others,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.200]   that it's androstenedione,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.100]   what is essentially a pro-hormone to testosterone,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.020]   it's androstenedione at very high levels
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.080]   that's produced in female hyenas
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.140]   that creates this enlargement of their genitalia.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.780]   So if you want to read up on androstenedione,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.500]   androstenedione is made into testosterone
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.800]   It's a complicated pathway to pronounce,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.080]   it's a fairly straightforward pathway biochemically.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.720]   You may recall during the '90s and 2000s,
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.080]   there were a lot of performance-enhancing drug scandals,
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.520]   in particular in Major League Baseball,
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.160]   and it was purported,
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   although I don't know that it was ever verified,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.360]   but it was purported that the major
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.440]   performance-enhancing drug of abuse at that time,
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.520]   in particular players whose names we won't mention,
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.860]   but you can Google it if you want to find out,
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.240]   was androstenedione.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.300]   And the last little anecdote about this,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.460]   which is also published in the scientific literature,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.680]   which is weird, but I do find interesting,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.020]   hormones are so fascinating,
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.820]   they're just incredible to me,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.020]   is going back to the marijuana plant.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.020]   You know, the marijuana plant has these estrogenic properties
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.060]   and I asked a plant biologist
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.140]   whether or not this was unusual,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.380]   but this plant biologist told me,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.740]   oh yeah, there are plants that make
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.120]   what is essentially the equivalent of testosterone,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.620]   like pine pollen, it looks a lot like testosterone,
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.460]   and there are other plants that make
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.100]   what is essentially estrogen.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.420]   And I said, well, why would they do that?
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.260]   He said that one of the reasons why some plants
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:13.260]   have evolved this capacity to increase estrogen levels
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.260]   in animals that smoke, not smoke it,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.860]   but then animals that consume them,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.700]   I'm guessing that animals aren't smoking marijuana,
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.340]   although I don't know, send me the paper
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.180]   if you've heard of this,
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.020]   is that plants have figured out ways,
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.980]   they've adapted ways to push back on populations of rodents
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.240]   and other species of animals that eat them.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.820]   So plants are engaged in a kind of plant to animal warfare
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.500]   where they increase the estrogen
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.340]   of the males in that population to lower the sperm counts,
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.580]   to keep those populations clamped at certain levels
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.540]   so that those plants can continue to flourish.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.460]   And I find this just fascinating.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:54.460]   And hormones, therefore, aren't just impacting tissue growth
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.220]   and development within the individual
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.660]   and between the mother,
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.680]   remember the placenta is an endocrine organ,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.660]   and the offspring,
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.220]   but plants and animals are in this communication.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.420]   So it's a fascinating area of biology.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.860]   And as you've noticed today,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.020]   none of this deals with the current controversies
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.340]   around gender and how many genders and sex, et cetera.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.820]   That's a separate conversation that is by definition,
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.620]   grounded in the kind of concepts
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.060]   we've been talking about today
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.760]   and needs to take place,
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.340]   taking into consideration all of the aspects of sex
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.560]   and the effects of hormones,
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.940]   both on the body, on the brain.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.340]   We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord,
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.480]   but we will in the next episode on,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.080]   but we can just say on the brain and the periphery,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.440]   early effects, late effects, acute effects,
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.500]   meaning effects that are very fast
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.580]   of levels of hormones going up or down,
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.040]   something that absolutely happens
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.700]   during and across the menstrual cycle,
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.280]   as well as long-term effects,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.060]   like the effects of these hormones on gene expression.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.180]   So today, as always,
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.980]   we weren't able to cover all things related to sex
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.180]   and hormones and sexual differentiation or development.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.460]   There's no way we could,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.660]   but we have covered a lot of material.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.500]   So once again,
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.740]   I want to thank you for embarking on this journey
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.900]   through neuroscience.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.900]   And today, neuroendocrinology with me.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.600]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.180]   [upbeat music]
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.760]   (upbeat music)
