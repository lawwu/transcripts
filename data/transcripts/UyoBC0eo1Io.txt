[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.080]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound. I'm your host, Ben Carlson. With me as always is the
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.640]   world's foremost expert in Oatly stock, Duncan Hill. On today's show, we're going to be answering
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.960]   questions about, how safe is it to buy a Peloton, since the company seems to be in trouble? How
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.260]   to hedge large gains in NVIDIA? This question was asked before they blew out earnings again
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.100]   last night. What happens in the stock market if inflation falls? How to create generational
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.420]   wealth and how to prepare yourself for a finance career coming out of college? We have one
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440]   of my favorite questions we've ever been asked today. At least by one of our -- it was one
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.440]   of my favorite people to ask. Remember, if you have a question, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.840]   Today's show is sponsored by Fabric by Gerber Life. When I got life insurance, my first
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   daughter was born. I figured I had to take that next step. That meant going down to an
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.960]   insurance broker in their office in some big glass building, sitting with them, having
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.000]   an awkward conversation, filling up on paperwork. It's like half a day, right? It was kind of
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.880]   a -- it's not fun. So Fabric by Gerber Life was designed by parents, for parents, to help
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.880]   you get a high quality, surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy. I mean, it could
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.240]   be less than 10 minutes. You could go from start to covered in less than 10 minutes with

[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.080]   caveats apply.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.880]   Mike, we got our own landing page there. That's cool.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.200]   It is very nice. Next week's show, we're going to be talking about insurance. A lot of people
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.120]   ask us, term versus life, or term versus whole life insurance, all this stuff. We're going
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.560]   to be talking about that. So covering all of that questions. Before we get into the
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.160]   show today, I want to quick shout out to one of our viewers, Mike from South Carolina.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.600]   Mike is a firefighter. We actually answered a question about his firefighter pension back
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.640]   on the show. He's going through a little bit of a tough time. He's got a wife, two kids.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.680]   And just want to give him a shout out, tell him we're thinking of him. I think one of
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   the things that we never take for granted here is how much personal information people
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.880]   are willing to share with us. It is kind of crazy. Some people just hate talking about
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.840]   money with their friends or family. People share with us so much personal information
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.040]   of the stuff they're going through, how much money they make, how much money they have
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.240]   saved, the goals they're thinking about. So we don't take that responsibility lightly.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.720]   We appreciate it. And we appreciate people like Mike following the show.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.720]   Yeah. Thanks, Mike.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   So let's do a question.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.400]   And you're part of a compound family. If you're here, you're family. That's our solution.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.320]   The people in the live chat that come here every single week, half the time I think they're
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.440]   just here to interact with each other because they've all become friends in the chat. But
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.560]   it's nice to know that it's like a little safety blanket that these people come here
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   every week to listen to us.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   Yeah. That's cool.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   All right. Question one.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.880]   Okay. I'll first say we have a question from Zane. Thanks for everything you and the Reholes
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.840]   team are doing. I've been a listener for a few years now and I've learned a lot. Also
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.360]   refreshing to hear from a fellow Michigander, which always sounds like a fancy kind of goose
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.080]   or something to me, you know, Michigander, but I've heard you mentioned before, but you
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.020]   owned a Peloton. The wife and I have been considering a Peloton bike for some time now
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.600]   and seem to be close to a purchase. But given the recent earnings report and poor guidance,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.160]   do you think it's still safe to purchase a Peloton?
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.840]   I did purchase the Peloton during the pandemic. I use one of those 0% loans back in the day.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.400]   It was like four years, 0% loan. I thought, why, why not? Why wouldn't I do this? So I
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.240]   think I just paid it off like a couple months ago. I was paying, I can't remember how much
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.980]   $60 a month or something. It wasn't even that much. I have to admit, I do share some of
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.920]   the concerns. Look at the stock price. John, give me a chart on here. This is Peloton stock.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.040]   It's down 98% from the highs, just gotten slaughtered. I think at the peak it was a
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.800]   $50 billion company, which is just insane, obviously. I always say that any sort of diet
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.440]   or health fitness thing is really just a fad to me. People thought Peloton was going to
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.480]   be like a trillion dollar company. That just never made much sense.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.220]   I mean, there was a time during the pandemic when people were on long wait lists to get
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.920]   them and stuff, right? It did have a boom.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.400]   And I think they just pulled forward. So, John, show the next one. I did a little deep
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.680]   dive on Peloton's financials. This is their net quarterly operating net income. And you
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.920]   can see, they were basically in the black for two or three quarters. Other than that,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.320]   every single quarter, they've lost money. They lost a lot of money in 2022. They've
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.520]   cut some costs, made it back a little bit. But they're still losing money every quarter.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.760]   John, do the next one for segment data. This is one of the reasons that I'm still okay
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   by them remaining a going concern. I'm not talking about the stock at all, I'm talking
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.440]   about the company. Subscriptions make up almost 40% of their revenue. So, they sell their
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.200]   products and that's 60%. But subscriptions and recurring revenue is 40% or so of their
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.600]   revenue. That's not bad. And if you, John, fill the next one up. I just pulled this from
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.640]   their latest quarterly report. They have 3 million paid subscribers and it's basically
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.880]   been flat for a while now. They might bring a few in and they lose a few, but it's more
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.080]   or less they have these 3 million customers that are paying subscribers and paying them
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.160]   anywhere from, I don't know, I think you can pay like $15 to $40 or $50 a month, depending
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.640]   on what kind of subscriptions you use. Because you can actually use a subscription for their
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.720]   fitness classes without having one of their pieces of equipment, because they do all this
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.400]   other stuff like aerobics and weight lifting and all this stuff. So, it's still a $1.5
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.000]   billion company. So, it's not like it's going away any time soon. So, I think the biggest
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.040]   worry would be, what if they just stop having new classes? They can't pay some of these
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.960]   teachers who have now become mini-celebrities in the Peloton world. So, the thing I like
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.900]   about this is, they actually have this old library. So, let's say, Duncan, I'm going
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.400]   on my jog and I step off the curb and I get hit by a bus tomorrow. That'd be kind of sad,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.880]   but you still have 10 plus years worth of Wealth of Common Sense catalog to go back
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.520]   to. That's the same thing with Peloton. They're digital stuff. They have it on the machine
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.160]   already. So, you can go back and use the old. So, I use the old classes. I don't always
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.400]   use the new ones. So, I think you still have that old library to use. So, maybe they have
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.060]   to bring the cost in. They don't have as many teachers. They don't have as many new classes.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.320]   All that stuff. Maybe we'll have some sort of AI-based teachers in the future, where
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.880]   they don't need to have the actual people. They can just say, "This is the kind of teacher
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   I want. I want them to show me how to do this." And you can create it for yourself on the
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   spot. So, I don't know. I know a lot of people think that, well, Amazon or Nike or Apple
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.720]   should just buy them. I think that's a terrible investment strategy. But maybe with 3 million
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.800]   recurring subscription payers, that's a pretty good, something to keep them going as a floor
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.720]   for someone who could come along and have some sort of strategic partnership with them.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.280]   A lot of people just say, "Well, Peloton's just a bike with an iPad on it." And I get
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.880]   that. But it is a really good product. And the people that use them like them. Unfortunately,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.080]   I don't think they're getting many new customers. I think whoever was going to buy one, for
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.440]   the most part, has already bought one.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.240]   Why wouldn't they just open up the Apple App Store and let other companies create classes
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   and things and then just take a cut of their revenue? Wouldn't that be an easy way to help
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.440]   people that have these fears?
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.040]   That makes sense. Or give these new teachers some exposure. And say, "You're doing this
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.960]   for free, but you're going to get some exposure from us, and you can sell your own." Yeah,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.680]   that makes sense. But you wonder if they have to scale back substantially on the classes
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.560]   and stuff. That makes sense first. But it's still a $1.5 billion company, so I don't think
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.000]   it's going out of business anytime soon. But I am a little worried that the experience
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.160]   is going to deteriorate. So, I don't know. I still like it. I'd feel okay buying another
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.040]   one today if I had to. That's where I stand.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.920]   If Peloton goes out of business, it's a good coat hanger.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.080]   Yeah. I was about to say, you always have a really nice place to hang coats and shirts
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   and things.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.800]   Alright, next question.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.240]   Up next, we have a question from Sarah. "I have 3% portfolio positions in Nvidia and
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.760]   AMD. I've already trimmed them some, but don't really want to sell any more at this time,
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.200]   even though I think the semiconductor space is overbought in the short term. I'm not comfortable
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.160]   with buying options, but I was looking at the Sox S ETF."
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.200]   Have you heard of this one before, Duncan?
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.480]   I have. You know I've heard of this.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.600]   I had to look it up. It's a three-time semiconductor bear.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   Yeah, inverse.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.680]   Yeah, inverse. Three times inverse.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   So they say, "Is taking a small position in this inverse-leveraged semi-ETF crazy? It
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.520]   feels like an easy way to hedge against the red-hot semiconductor space." But what are
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   your thoughts?
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.360]   Alright, let's bring in an expert on this. I originally started reading this guy's stuff.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.920]   I think it was called the Apprentice Investor Series at thestreet.com. Mr. Barry Rittholz.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.000]   Barry, is that right?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.440]   Yeah, that was early 2000s. God, you were reading that in grade school. That has to
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   be crazy stuff.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.120]   I'm doing book reports.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   But you wrote about this kind of stuff.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.760]   Nobody was writing about that then, right?
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   But you wrote about this kind of stuff, and you wrote about the psychology behind it.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.600]   I'm sure we could give this person some tips about different ways to hedge, but this is
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.440]   really a psychological question more than anything.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.040]   Well, it's important. She sounds like an institutional investor whose clients want her hedged against
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.600]   potential short-term -- oh, wait, this is an individual investor? What does she care
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.000]   if semiconductors are overbought or oversold? Why is she talking about hedging? And by the
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.840]   way, the leveraged ETFs, see the long and short? If you want to hedge, they're a terrible
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.920]   way to hedge because of the time decay of options. It's an expensive way to hedge.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.280]   It's like a daily hedge. So you have to not only get the direction right, you have to
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.480]   be right on the day that you're hedging.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.920]   Also, this expense ratio has to be 1% or something, right?
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.960]   It's crazy because of the cost. So the first question is just simply, why do you own these
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.520]   stocks? Is it for alpha? Is this part of your cowboy account, your fun account? If that's
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.160]   the case, well then, let it run.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.400]   On the other hand, if you have a concentrated stock-picking portfolio and that's where all
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:33.920]   your money is in, it seems like that's a lot of work to be stressing about one-thirty-third
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   of your portfolio.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.200]   You're right. The whole hedging thing sounds really good in theory. It's really hard to
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.520]   pull off in practice, especially if you're trying to hedge individual positions that
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.120]   have their own idiosyncratic risks. Obviously, NVIDIA is probably a big part of that semiconductor
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.680]   ETF, and so is AMD.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.920]   It's funny, look, AMD goes back to, I don't know, the 1980s or something?
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   '90s, '80s, yeah.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:01.160]   Listen to some of the drawdowns this stock has had since then. 93%, 90%, 72%, 89%, 95%,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:09.360]   and 65%. That's what they've recovered from. NVIDIA's had 92%, 82%, 56%, and 64%. It's
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.160]   funny, NVIDIA was down 64% in 2022. I tweeted about this today, it was down to $280 billion
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.120]   in market cap in October 2022, and now it's close to $2 trillion.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   Wow.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.080]   So, I can see why people are thinking about this. And we've gotten a million questions
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.040]   about NVIDIA. I hold this thing, listen, if it gets too high of your portfolio, you sell
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.560]   it. I think you probably want some rebalancing rules here. If it gets to 5% of my portfolio,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.680]   I'm going to trim it back to two or three. I think that's kind of the way you can think
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.240]   about this if you want to not let it get too crazy, where it's going to really hurt you
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.760]   if it falls.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.000]   To me, if it's in my fun account, I just let it run, and if it goes to zero, so be it.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.640]   But you said something a couple of shows ago that is very relevant here, and has to do
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:00.480]   with the psychological impact. You take out homeowner's fire insurance, not because you're
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.040]   hedging your house, but in case of a catastrophic disaster, you want to be protected and you
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.160]   don't want to worry about it day in, day out.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.800]   So if you're thinking about hedging a position that's done well, it means you're stressing
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.580]   about it, and that's kind of revealing. I think there's a bigger issue here than the
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.840]   semis and hedging. It's why do you own this? How does this fit into your portfolio? And
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.800]   what are you doing that's making you so uncomfortable?
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.500]   This is like the George Soros back pain. She's feeling the back pain. Maybe it's time to
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:41.000]   sell a little bit and be okay with it. I don't know, hold on to some of its house money,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.600]   but sell a little bit if you're really that worried about it. And to your other point,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.400]   if you really believe in this stock for the long term, then you're going to have to hold
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.240]   through some volatile times because it is so crazy.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's right. In that Apprentice Investor Series, one of the rules for selling was figure
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.080]   out your sell discipline before you own something while you're still objective. Once you own
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.720]   something and it's run up, your objectivity now, is she concerned about a drawdown or
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.680]   is she concerned about this going all the way back down and this big win, this perhaps
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.560]   change of standard of living win is going to be disastrous. In which case, then you
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:26.280]   have to think in terms of regret minimization, not portfolio optimization, but why do you
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.440]   own this? How does it fit into your investing and how does it affect your ability to sleep
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.520]   at night?
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.560]   Yeah. And there's no right or wrong answer here because we don't know what's going to
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.880]   happen next. This stock could keep going up and make people who are saying I should have
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.120]   sold to look like idiots, but you have to think about what you're going to regret more
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.800]   if it falls 50% or the rest of the year if it goes up another 100%.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.080]   I won't bore you with war stories, but I could give you hundreds of examples of stocks that
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.600]   had run up $5,000 and $10,000 and people wrote them up and wrote them down. It was terrible.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.560]   You have to know why you own it and how it fits into the overall investment philosophy.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.640]   I sold GameStop around like $11 after a double back right before the meme mania.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.440]   No one ever went broke taking a profit.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.320]   I got to look at the newfangled iPod in the early 2000s and bought Apple and made fun
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.560]   of the guys at 15 who sold it at 20 because I held it for a triple. Aren't I a genius?
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.560]   All right. Next question.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:37.100]   Okay. Up next we have a question from Mike. Is the supposed primary driver of the monster
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.880]   move in stocks since November, if, sorry, if the supposed primary driver of the monster
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.440]   move in stocks since November has been the Fed pivoting, and if inflation stickiness
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.000]   puts off cuts or puts rate hikes back on the table, then why wouldn't the S&P fall back
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.240]   to October and November levels?
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.560]   Okay. This might be true if the only thing the stock market cared about was the Fed and
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.920]   inflation. I think some people get it twisted in their head that because it seems like the
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.640]   market and the news flow only pays attention to certain things at certain times, that there's
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.600]   this single variable that can control the stock market when there's so many other moving
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.040]   pieces and sometimes the market really does care about whatever economic data piece you're
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:23.440]   looking at, and sometimes it just completely forgets it. So we could certainly fall back
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.120]   some if inflation stays sticky and stays high and the Fed puts off cuts or has to hike again.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.920]   I wouldn't throw that out of the realm of possibilities. That doesn't necessarily mean
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.200]   you have to retest that exact level.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:41.600]   Yeah, I don't disagree. And I have to point out if inflation stickiness, we're recording
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:51.280]   this in February 2024, inflation peaked at 9% year over year in June 2022. We're coming
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:57.240]   up on two years. I'm genuinely shocked when people talk about the stickiness of inflation.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.280]   Not only year over year are we in the threes, but if you just look at the past six months,
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.760]   we're in the twos. Inflation is over. Are we still fighting the last war again? I'm
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.120]   not focused on the Fed. I'm not focused on inflation. Assume rates are going to be somewhat
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.360]   lower in the next year, but we ain't going back to zero. But what's much more important
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.600]   to me at this stage than the Fed, corporate earnings, which looked to be pretty good,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:33.280]   the economy, job creation, consumer spending, all of which to be pretty good, long-term
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:40.560]   low in unemployment, consumer spending starting to slow, but that's just after the giant post-pandemic
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   surge.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.260]   And then investor psychology, which is slowly improving after really getting battered by
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.500]   inflation. But the Fed's one issue. It's one of many.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:58.120]   At the lows, in October 2022, when the market bottomed, inflation was still 8%. You're right.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.500]   People say it's sticky, but it's basically at the long-term average. And I'm sorry, instead
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.380]   of 3%, it's 3.1% or something. People are worried about a decimal point. That's still
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.500]   way, way better than it was back then. And yeah, maybe the market doesn't like it if
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.040]   the Fed doesn't cut and puts off cuts for a few more months, and maybe there's some
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.140]   short-term volatility. But again, that doesn't necessarily mean that things are now as bad
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.980]   as they were back then, because things seemed pretty bleak back then on the stock market
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.260]   bottom.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:31.940]   Humans have a terrible time conceptualizing, transitory, conceptualizing. The transitory
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.480]   didn't happen in a week. Everybody was upset. You look at a chart from the peak of inflation
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:44.180]   to now, it's like 18 months, 20 months, something like that. The whole spike in inflation, as
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:49.500]   Ed Yardini has written about, and crash, they tend to be symmetrical. So when it goes up
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.460]   really quickly, it tends to come down really quickly. And again, there's a whole collection
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:18:00.980]   of economists from the '60s and '70s, folks like Larry Summers, who think this is a '70s
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.460]   era inflation.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.340]   It's not. If you want to draw historical analogies, look at the post-World War II era, where you
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:15.180]   had this spike in inflation. You had unemployment plummet as all these GIs came back to work.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:22.060]   The economy did great. And that inflation also was transitory. To me, the COVID lockdown
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.900]   is more akin to a war than we had a decade of inflation, and oil embargoes, and--
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.940]   And we did have wartime-like spending, too.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.700]   Yeah. It was very-- that's right, massive fiscal stimulus. So I'm much-- and I lived--
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:42.940]   I remember as a kid going to get gasoline for my lawnmower side hustle. And they would
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:48.620]   ask me, are you an even license plate number or an odd license plate number? Because there
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:53.460]   was gasoline rationing. And I'm like, dude, I'm a 12-year-old kid. I don't have a car.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.460]   You're like, this is America.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.460]   I just need a gallon of gas.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.460]   Give me my gas.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.940]   One of my favorite stories from my father is he said in the late '70s, to keep up wages,
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.300]   he got a raise twice in the same year. They gave him a raise, and six months later, gave
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.700]   him another one. And wage growth is still pretty good right now. It's above the rate
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.420]   of inflation, but it's not like it's a crazy high number like it was in the '70s.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.820]   Right. And it's making up for about three decades of very slow wage growth in the bottom
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:24.180]   half of the earnings scale. In fact, one of the things people don't talk about, wages
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:30.860]   were deflationary up until the pandemic for like 30 years. Now they're playing catch up.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:38.060]   We should really tie minimum wage to CPI so it goes up gradually instead of these big
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.460]   steps every 10, 20 years.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.260]   Yeah, this is a huge step up for the bottom quartile of income. Yeah, I agree. And you've
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.300]   written too, I think you probably wrote on the Apprentice Investor or on the Big Picture
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.100]   about single variable analysis. And you look at it through the lens of, don't look at just
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.060]   a P/E ratio or whatever for the stock market, but the same thing is true with economic data.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.700]   You can't just look at one piece of data and think that's going to be the tell.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:08.500]   If P/E was the sole tell of markets and investing, then A, it would be really easy to invest,
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:15.300]   and B, big, well-equipped firms would figure this out and arbitrage that advantage away.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:21.340]   It's always much more complicated than that. I hate oversimplified solutions to complex
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.620]   questions. It just leads us to the wrong place.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.020]   Yeah, and the market is a very complex system.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.460]   For sure. The three-body problem, not only are you predicting what's going to happen,
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.820]   then you have to predict people's first-order reaction to that, then the second-order reaction
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.020]   to the first thing that happens. You can throw a pebble in a pond and see those rings, but
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.780]   if you throw a handful of pebbles in, you have no idea where the rings are going to
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.780]   pop.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.620]   Are we in a safe space here? I tried to read the book and I couldn't do it.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.780]   It's tough. It's a tough slog.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.220]   It was a hard read. I know everyone loves it, and I think it's going to make it into
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.420]   a series on Netflix or Apple, but I couldn't make it through it.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.780]   It's hard. Anytime something's written originally in another language, like Chinese,
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.260]   and then translated into English, it doesn't make for the most flowing of prose.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.660]   All right. Don't tell anyone I said that. All right. Next question.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.420]   All right. Up next, we have a question from Bruce. "I'm 73, and my wife is 58, and
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:28.140]   I have a 15-year-old son. We own a small farm and house in Iowa. We also own three properties
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.300]   in Spain, where we spend most of the year." Maybe we can get an invite to Spain out of
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.700]   this. I don't know.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.740]   "We have no debt and are sitting on $2 million in cash, most of it in short-term bills. I
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.420]   deal in vintage guitars and will keep doing it as long as I can. We have a great life
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.220]   and are careful with our spending. I would like to have a plan to create generational
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.060]   wealth. Is this possible? Any suggestions?"
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.300]   All right. Bruce might be the most interesting man in the world because he lives on a farm
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:01.740]   in Iowa. He sells vintage guitars, and he owns three properties in Spain. In his email
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.380]   signature line, you would appreciate this, Perry. He had a link to his guitar website,
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:11.260]   and we looked at it. He's got all these old guitars, and it's fantastic. They sell
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.900]   for a lot of money, but he's got guitars from the 1800s, 1950s, 1960s. I saw one there
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.020]   from 1929, which I wouldn't buy just because it would be a bearish omen. He's got a
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.300]   really fantastic set of these guitars that he sells.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.860]   Why would it be bearish? Markets are way up since 1929.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.860]   That's fair.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.860]   It's true.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.100]   So I think there's two ways to look at the question of generational wealth. So there's
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.700]   the estate planning, tax planning, investment planning, wills, trust, et cetera. That side
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.860]   of things, that's money stuff. That's actually the easy part of the equation, I think. You
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.140]   can hire experts at a wealth management firm to help you with that stuff. You can hire
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.780]   lawyers and CPAs and all that stuff. I think the hard part is a psychological hurdle that
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.380]   comes with teaching the next generation about money, and I think the next generation can
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.500]   really screw it up if you're not careful.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.860]   My favorite example of this, I wrote about this in one of my books, Cornelius Vanderbilt
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.460]   was the richest man alive when he died, would still be one of the richest people alive if
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.500]   you put it in today's dollars. We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars. He even told
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.860]   his kids, "Any fool can make a fortune, but it takes a real man, a wise man, to actually
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:21.820]   keep it." And then there's this book that talks about how 100 years after his death,
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.180]   all his descendants showed up to the university that bears his name in Tennessee, and not
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.820]   a single one of them was a millionaire, even though he passed on the largest fortune ever
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.100]   at the time.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.180]   So I think you've talked about this before, about the first thing is do no harm. I guess
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.100]   the first question is how do you not screw it up? That's the big question, not how do
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.580]   we grow it? How do you not screw it up?
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:51.180]   So a couple of things leap out of this letter. The first is, what does he mean by generational
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:59.500]   wealth? I assume he wants his wife, who's 15 years his junior, to have a comfortable
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:05.420]   life, and then his son, who's 40-something years younger than her, to have a comfortable
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.180]   life. So let's define that as the generational wealth.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.960]   And then just ballparking what they're saying, the farm, the house, three houses, properties
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:24.180]   in Spain, whatever guitars he has, I'm guessing he has three, four, five million to start
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.540]   to work with, maybe more, maybe less. The first question is, why are you sitting in
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:36.100]   two million of cash? That kind of leaps out. Especially, at the very least, you should
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.300]   be getting 4% or 5% in bonds or depending on--
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.220]   That's the barbell portfolio. You've got cash on one side, guitars on the other.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:53.180]   And then the other thing is, there's a tendency for 73-year-olds to not think about stocks.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:25:00.900]   Because hey, my lifespan is I'm going to live to 89, so I only have another 10, 15 years,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.980]   and I'm nervous about that. But you have to think in terms of a 58-year-old woman and
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:10.940]   a 15-year-old son. So that means this is now a 30, 40, 50-year portfolio.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.740]   The generational wealth part of it is your son's time horizon is super duper long.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:22.900]   Is equity. Right, exactly. So he needs a portfolio that is constructed so that he could live
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:30.900]   comfortably on the income it throws off, that his wife could spend 20, 30 years. And I'm
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.980]   not a big fan of the wealthy families that put the kids' money in trust and don't let
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.540]   them touch it till they're 40 or 50. I just think about how much easier life would have
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:46.420]   been if I could have bought that first house at 30, and now it's so difficult for young
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.460]   people to buy houses.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.620]   Right, help them when they need it.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:55.020]   Right. There should be a way that-- it really depends on the specifics of the dollar amount,
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.580]   but plan on helping your kid buy that first house.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.380]   I think people are terrified of having a bunch of spoiled brats, you know, that are trying
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.380]   to balance that.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:09.300]   But there's a difference. There's a huge difference between having an unlimited amount of cash.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:15.820]   You know, I'm always aghast when I see around the corner from me, my backyard neighbor,
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:21.540]   I'm walking the dogs, there's a lime green Lamborghini Spider out there. And I ping my
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.020]   neighbor, I'm like, "I didn't know you were a Lambo guy." He's like, "It's my son's friend.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:32.780]   He's 16." I'm like, "Get the hell out of here. I would kill myself in that car at 16." You
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   don't want to do that.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.580]   Yeah, you have to teach them to value the dollar and to work hard and all that.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   Earn it.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.480]   Yeah, but that's true whether they have one or not.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.780]   Right out here on 40th Street, when I was coming to the office today, I saw a guy that
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.460]   couldn't have been older than 22 driving a Rolls-Royce SUV.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.460]   That's $300,000, $400,000.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.100]   But I think the not screwing it up part, especially like you mentioned, sitting in cash, you have
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.580]   to figure out, you got to make sure you don't trust the wrong person or organization to
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.540]   help you manage it because you're going to need someone to manage it. You can't take
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.820]   on insane amounts of leverage and spend too much. And it sounds like he's already got
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.420]   that figured out. He said they don't spend very much. He's obviously sitting in cash.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.460]   So I think you just have to kind of give some of those same traits to your children and
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.980]   they'll be fine. But yeah, I think teaching them to value a dollar is probably the true
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:26.260]   way that you help them compound, not just giving them the money and saying, "Here,
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.260]   have at it."
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.300]   Right. For that planning, plan to make sure your wife has enough income for the rest of
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:36.580]   her life. If you want to pull money aside to help your kid with the down payment, that's
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.820]   something you could do. "Hey, you're going to have to pay for the house. We'll help
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:46.580]   you with the 10% down." So whether that's $100,000 or whatever, I'm extrapolating out
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.700]   home prices 15 years from now.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.180]   Yeah. Well, maybe that's part of it, is just having the conversation early, right?
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.860]   Yeah, absolutely. It's an uncomfortable, for a lot of people find it an uncomfortable
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:03.620]   conversation, but it's crucial. So everybody is on the same page. Everybody's expectations
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.420]   are the same. You don't want to find out the wife is like, "I don't want income.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.620]   I want to go travel." Once you're gone, "I'm hopping on a flight and I'm traveling
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:16.940]   around the world." You need to have those conversations so you can make the appropriate
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.940]   plans.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.180]   At what point do you buy a university building? What level of wealth is that?
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.700]   Well, you have to do the Larry David thing where you have it donated by anonymous, though.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.700]   Right, right.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.900]   I'm going to say that's a billion dollars.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.340]   Oh, okay. Wow.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:39.300]   Because it's probably 50 to 100 million. And that has gone up because I think the Booth
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:45.460]   School in Chicago was like a $300 million gift. And they named the whole school after
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.180]   him. So somewhere around there.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.420]   Your first point, though, about defining what is generational wealth, what does that even
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.620]   mean to you? I think some people just think, "Yeah, you have to figure out what you mean
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.620]   by that first."
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:04.100]   It's not going to keep your great, great, great grandkids going to school for free.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:11.340]   It's worry about your wife and kid and generations beyond that. You need hundreds of millions
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:15.300]   of dollars to start thinking true, sustainable generational wealth.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.700]   So Jared in the chat says that 20 years ago as a bank teller, they had an old couple who
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.540]   would drive through one time a week in a Rolls Royce to get $500 and 20s to tip people with.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   That's what I like. It's a piece of generosity.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.460]   20 years ago. Spread the wealth.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.900]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:34.140]   I'll never forget. I can't mention the person's name. I'm at lunch. And the check comes and
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.380]   he slips a $100 bill. This is before his company got bought. He was doing well. Slips a $100
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.660]   bill into the check that was like $100 in addition to his credit card. So the company
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:52.220]   paid for lunch, but the tip was on him. And then the co-check person, he gave the woman
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:58.180]   a $20 tip on an umbrella that could not have cost more than $10. Spread it around.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.860]   Generosity. That's a good one to teach. All right, we got one more question.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.860]   Okay. Last but not least, we have a question from Grant. I'm currently a junior in college
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:12.020]   working toward my finance degree with a concentration in investments. What are your thoughts on
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:17.020]   why larger companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley seek out internship applicants
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.180]   two years in advance when most people like myself explore various interests throughout
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.020]   college? This is a serious disadvantage to those discovering a late-blooming passion.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:31.700]   I love the idea of being in college and having a late-blooming passion. Considering the first
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.860]   half of college isn't major specific, what tools can be utilized to jumpstart a finance
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.340]   career straight out of college?
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.380]   I do think the sheer amount of information available these days, at least the people
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.900]   that I interact with coming out of college, they know way more than I ever knew about
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   the stuff that they want to do. They know the kind of company they want to work for.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.780]   They know the type of job they want to do. And they want to have that dream job right
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.340]   away. I came out of college completely clueless. And I think the thing you have to realize
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.140]   is you don't have to have it all figured out. Barry, what was your path? You were law
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:08.020]   school to trader to macro strategist to blogger and podcaster and then wealth management founder.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.820]   You couldn't have plotted out that course if you tried.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:18.300]   I have a totally ass-backwards career path. We call that atypical career path. But I will
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:24.020]   tell you, my favorite question that I ask at the end of every Masters in Business is,
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:31.340]   what sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in going in your career?
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.560]   And it doesn't matter what the career is. The advice always seems to be the same. Build
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:44.420]   a stack of skills. Always be learning. Always generate a network. Assemble a group of people
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.700]   that you trust and trust you so that you can grow together. Be a great asset to whatever
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:57.100]   your boss needs in whatever field it is, whether it's finance or not. And develop good habits,
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:04.660]   meaning we make our habits and then our habits make us. So make sure that—I develop the
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:10.780]   habit of reading and writing. You should really develop a good diet and exercise habit. You
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:19.500]   should learn to be on time. You'd be shocked at the little things that can get a boss angry.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:25.540]   Whatever your first job is or even your first internship, doesn't matter to your career,
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:31.340]   but it's a place to meet people, to learn, to act as a stepping stone, to create a group
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.220]   of either mentors or someone who can be a reference.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.060]   You also have to learn how to be an adult in some ways and how to act around people.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.820]   So I did an internship when I was a senior in college. And for me, it was helpful because
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.780]   I learned what I didn't want to do. I think that's half the battle when you're young,
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:51.180]   is even if you know, "This is where I want to go," working for one of these big companies,
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.320]   there's so many different places you can go, especially in the finance world. There's so
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.060]   many different career paths that you can take. So I think checking off the list of, "Okay,
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.620]   I know I don't want to do this one. I know I don't want to do that."
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.780]   I had a friend who did an investment banking internship in college, and he said he wanted
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.700]   to do it because he heard he'd make a ton of money. But he did it for a semester, and
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.100]   he thought, "I'm not going to work 90 hours a week. Are you kidding me? There's no way
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.180]   I could do this." So you have to learn what you don't want to do first.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:20.180]   I did that as a summer associate. You made a ton of money. You worked crazy hours. And
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.700]   you learn, "Oh, I don't want to do this. This is a terrible job." You're making a little
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.740]   more than minimum wage, but you're working 100 hours a week. What fun is that?
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:35.900]   But the key takeaway that I just keep coming back to is what you said, is you're learning
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.620]   how to be an adult navigating in the real world. And they don't teach you those, at
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.780]   least when I went to college or grad school, they never taught us those skills. Stop and
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:52.020]   think about it. I remember the guy who was the office next to mine in my first job was
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:57.300]   always late, really smart, really good, super talented, eventually got fired because he
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.620]   just couldn't get to the office on time. You have to figure out ... Every dog likes to
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:08.260]   be pet differently is an old expression. Figure out what your boss wants. Figure out how to
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:15.420]   do the best possible job and be of value to the company, even if it's not what you want
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:22.780]   to do for the rest of your life, because especially in your 20s, every job is a stepping stone.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:29.000]   You meet people, you learn skills, and then you move on to the next gig.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.020]   Last week was career advice from Josh. This week from Barry. That's pretty good, right?
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.180]   I hope we're not conflicting with each other.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.620]   Nope. Two different types of people. Thanks to Barry, as always, for hopping on. Check
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.580]   out Barry's new podcast, At The Money.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.580]   Yup.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.340]   Duncan was ... And it's on the Masters of Business podcast feed, right?
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.540]   Right. It will eventually get its own feed, but since it's just a couple of months old,
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.540]   we wanted to ...
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.020]   Duncan wanted to know who you had to pay off to get the "Who" as your song.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.020]   Yeah. How did you get that?
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:35:01.940]   The crazy thing, in the first couple of episodes, it was like the usual stress-filled news sort
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:08.100]   of soundtrack, and I hate it. And I went to somebody and said, "What can I do to change
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.100]   this music?"
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.740]   They're like, "Well, how much do you need?" "I don't know. 10 seconds?" "Hey, as long
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:18.180]   as it's less than 30 seconds, here's the catalog. Get whatever you want." Last week was Fortunate
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.100]   Son. I've been enthralled with the music I've had access to.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.580]   Yeah. I was listening to your most recent one with Dunning, and I was like-
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.580]   Right. "Who are you?"
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.580]   "How did you get the 'Who'?" Yeah.
