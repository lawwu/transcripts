[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   I tend to think that life follows these natural sort of like ballooning phases where like
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.040]   you kind of come in and then you balloon back out, you come back in and then balloon back
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.720]   out depending on the different phases, right? Like when you're young, you're very much like
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.000]   expanding that balloon of your social networks, the people you're meeting in your 20s, you're
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.400]   like early career years, you're building these networks, you're building these relationships
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.040]   that are going to kind of continue to grow over the course of your life. But then as
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.120]   you have kids, you sort of narrow that a bit as you like focus in on those really, really
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.520]   important core relationships. And then as they get older, I think it starts to expand
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.840]   again, I see my parent now expanding and spreading their wings again.
