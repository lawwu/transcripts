[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.460]   Well, in the morning after the crazy November 2020 election here in the states, there were
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.260]   several culture commentators who observed that amidst all of the confusion over who
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.520]   won the presidency, there was no mistaking who won the night. Marijuana. Four additional
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.240]   states passed ballot measures to legalize recreational use of pot for adults, and none
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.960]   of the votes were even close. Those states included Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   South Dakota, bringing the total to 15 total states. And many remaining states have decriminalized
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   it, showing where the cultural trajectory is headed. 37 states in total have legalized
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.200]   medical use marijuana, something that you support, Pastor John, if governed by appropriate
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   physician oversight and prescriptions. You explained that way back in APJ 77, episode
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.520]   77, back in the day. But just a decade ago, I believe recreational cannabis was illegal
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.720]   in all 50 states, and that's being overturned very quickly. And each year, this is growing
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.400]   as a bigger and bigger issue for Christians and pastors and parents and churches. Do you
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.800]   have anything new to say as recreational use gains widespread support in red and blue states
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.400]   across our country?
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.040]   It's not exactly new, but I do have something I want to say in regard to the fact that 10
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:35.600]   years ago, recreational cannabis was illegal in all 50 states, whereas this is increasingly
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.520]   not the case today. And what I want to draw attention to by way of exhortation and encouragement,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.720]   even though it may sound pessimistic to some, is that this fact, the legalization of pot,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.320]   draws attention to something that we need to be aware of and we need to adjust our thinking
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:11.160]   about, namely, that the church for a long time has leaned too heavily on the overlap
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.740]   between the state and the church for the strength of our conviction concerning what is right
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.280]   and wrong. In other words, if the state has regarded something as wrong or illegal, then
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.080]   the church hasn't had to work very hard to teach any deep roots for the conviction or
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.400]   any thorough biblical argumentation or any conviction strengthening inspiration because
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.520]   everybody just assumes that the behavior is out of bounds. The state expectations and
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.080]   the cultural mores overlap with Christian ways, and so we can just coast. Now stop and
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.760]   think of the number of behaviors that were once illegal and are no more. Divorce was
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.560]   once illegal. Adultery and fornication were illegal. Homosexual practices were illegal.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.300]   Indecency was illegal in such a way that what's considered acceptable in movies and on beaches
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.360]   today would have been forbidden. Sabbath breaking was illegal. Abortion was illegal in every
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.760]   state, and the list could go on and on. Now, the point is not that these things should
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:42.520]   or shouldn't be illegal. The point is that because they were illegal, the church didn't
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.400]   have to think very hard or work very hard or teach very deeply or inspire very effectively
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.000]   to inculcate convictions and attitudes and behaviors in our young people or in new converts.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.040]   We simply could assume that our people wouldn't do these things because they were taboo and
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.440]   illegal in the culture. The church leaned, you could say, on the culture for its catechism,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   its teaching, its inspiration, its conviction. So the church assumed so much overlap between
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.240]   culture convictions and Christian convictions that you didn't often hear teaching or preaching
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.600]   that taught the church how to be alien or strange or weird or maligned. And I use the
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.040]   word maligned because that's the word Peter uses in 1 Peter 4, verse 3, when he says,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.280]   "The time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.640]   and passions and drunkenness and orgies and drinking parties and lawless idolatry. With
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.560]   respect to this, they are surprised you do not now run with them anymore, and they malign
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:08.280]   you." In other words, for most of American history, there has been so much overlap between
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:17.960]   cultural mores and outward Christian behaviors that this text in 1 Peter 4 seemed designed
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.000]   for another world. Like, what does that text have to do with anything in America? For centuries,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.920]   many Americans would go to church not in spite of being maligned, but because not to go would
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:42.600]   be maligned. So the so-called Judeo-Christian ethic shaped laws and churches to such an
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.520]   extent that the culture, as much as the church, discipled our young people. I grew up in that
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.960]   world anyway when I was a kid. And little effort went into cultivating a mindset that
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:05.040]   Christians are not of this world, but are sojourners and exiles and will be maligned
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:13.440]   if they walk in step with Jesus. Little effort went into helping Christians sink their moral
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:23.240]   roots deep into Christ and the gospel and his Word and his way such that we would be
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.600]   able to take a stand for some truth or some attitude or some behavior when no one else
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.680]   is standing with us. That's a biblical, spiritual, parental church responsibility that has been
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:50.000]   significantly neglected, and that neglect is now being exposed by the speed and flagrancy
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.720]   of the cultural normalization of sin. So the destigmatization and legalization of attitudes
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:09.520]   and behaviors which are out of step with Christ can be, I think, a roundabout way of something
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.560]   good for the church. We should not have been leaning so heavily on the culture for support
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:24.600]   of what we held to be right and wrong. America tried, Christians included, to use the legislature
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.440]   to banish the misuse of alcohol by making alcohol illegal. Prohibition lasted from 1920
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   to 1933. It failed. My guess is that a better case could be made today to outlaw alcohol
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:49.480]   than to outlaw cannabis. Forty percent of all violent crimes involve alcohol. Forty
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:57.560]   percent of all fatal motor vehicle accidents involve alcohol. We may find that the legalization
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.460]   of pot puts it in that category, but maybe not. In fact, from what I read, it's not going
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:11.660]   to work that way. It doesn't have those same kind of effects. My point is this. The focus
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:21.700]   and the moral energy of the church, the great majority of our effort, should not be on pursuing
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:29.000]   political and legal and cultural support for behaviors and attitudes we want to see in
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.660]   our children and in our churches. That is a misplaced focus. I'm not saying there's
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:45.980]   no role for Christians in politics or legislatures where they can make their case for what they
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:55.620]   consider to be healthy for society. But I am saying that effort should never, never
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:03.540]   even come close to being the primary focus of pastors and parents. The primary focus
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:11.020]   should be to do what only the Bible and only the gospel and only the Holy Spirit and the
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:20.620]   truth and Jesus can do in transforming human beings into the kind of Christ-exalting, Spirit-dependent,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:29.940]   God-glorifying people who freely choose not to use drugs, whether caffeine or alcohol
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:37.380]   or cannabis or cocaine or meth or heroin, not to use drugs to escape into a world where
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:44.220]   Christ is less clearly perceived and the Scriptures are less understood and precious and the Spirit
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.220]   is less personal and the glory of God is less satisfying and the way of righteousness is
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:56.220]   less defined and the path of obedience is less compelling. We want people, Christians,
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:03.820]   to freely reject anything that would put them in that kind of mindset. To be a Christian,
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:11.300]   a true Christian, is a very radical thing. It's a miraculous thing. It's a supernatural
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:18.540]   thing. It requires not a little bit of effort while we try to get the world on our side,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.180]   which by definition is never going to happen. It requires the whole focus of the pastoral
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.700]   ministry, evangelizing and preaching and worshiping and counseling and teaching and setting radical
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:38.100]   examples for the people. It requires focused, Spirit-dependent, Bible-saturated efforts
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:44.580]   of parents to call down the miracle through their parenting and through the church of
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:51.380]   the creation of young people who are joyfully willing to be out of step with the world.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:11:01.020]   So that's the message I think God is sending us in the destigmatization and normalization
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:08.540]   and legalization of behaviors and attitudes and drugs that we think are out of step with
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:14.140]   the gospel. It's a call to be the church and to be the home.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:20.700]   Amen. Yes, we depend on a divine miracle within us to resist the world. Thank you, Pastor
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.860]   John. Thank you for joining us today. You can ask a question of your own, search our

[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:43.860]   Well, why does God make some people attractive and he makes other people physically unattractive?
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.780]   God could make us all attractive. He doesn't. Why? It's a heartfelt question from a listener
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.580]   who struggles with this question, and we will start the week with it on Monday. I'm your
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.100]   host Tony Renke. We'll see you back here on the other side of the weekend. Thanks for
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.860]   listening. We'll see you then.
