[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Here on the left is a spinning ASCII donut, and on the right is a donut-shaped C code
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080]   by Andy Sloan that generates it.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.780]   Now with syntax highlighting.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.600]   Now I recommend you check out Andy's blog post on the mathematics behind a flying spinning
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.920]   torus, aka donut.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.220]   The link to the post is in the description.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.540]   The basic steps are create a circle, then create a torus by rotating the circle about
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.300]   the Y axis.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.800]   Then using rotation matrices, spin the donut around the X and Z axes.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.960]   Finally project the donut onto the 2D screen, adding illumination by calculating the surface
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.820]   normal after picking a particular light source.
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.660]   The cool thing is because this is ASCII world, there's different characters associated with
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.820]   different levels of luminance.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.080]   We can go back to the de-obfuscated version of the code that I generated, adding a microsecond
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.680]   sleep function to aid in the animation.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.880]   Compiling and running the code, we get our spinning donut.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.320]   There's a lot of parameters that you can control with this donut, including the field of view
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.080]   and the distance of the donut from the viewer.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.320]   I spend at least an hour every day learning and exploring outside my main line of work,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.600]   so I thought it'd be cool to start throwing together quick little videos about things
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.840]   that I find beautiful, whether they're basic or advanced in the world of machine learning,
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.440]   math, computer science, programming, psychology, whatever, even biology, physics, history,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   and philosophy.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.840]   So, hope this is of value, fun, and something you would enjoy.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   Thanks for watching.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   Have a great day.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   Bye.
