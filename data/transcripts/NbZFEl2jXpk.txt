[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.440]   - Pastor John, today we address a heavy question.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.940]   Sometimes we do that on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.440]   And this time it comes from North Carolina
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.040]   and from a couple who has been recently in the news
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.060]   for their personal tragedy,
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.540]   a tragedy that they wrote into us about as well.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.340]   Lindsay, the wife, asks this.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.560]   Pastor John, we recently lost septuplets at 21 weeks
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.260]   of gestation.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.220]   What does the Bible teach about the eternal destiny
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.120]   of seven unborn children and of infants who die?
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.960]   Moreover, what does the Bible teach about reuniting
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.040]   with our children and family members in heaven?
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.320]   - Well, I am very sorry, Lindsay, for your loss.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.560]   I can only relate a little bit
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.020]   because of the loss of our granddaughter,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.100]   stillborn, dying in the last week of her nine-month life.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.340]   But I know that's not really very much empathy
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.100]   because you lost seven and you're the mother.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.100]   You carried them and I'm only a grandfather who watched.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.220]   So my empathy is inadequate and I only mention it
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.580]   to say that Jesus' empathy is not inadequate.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.580]   And his understanding is unsearchable and very profound.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.300]   I pray that you found it so.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.580]   So I'll tell you what I believe about your question
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.580]   and you will need to be a good Berean,
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.980]   like it says in Acts 17, where they went away
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.840]   and read their Bibles to test and see if these things
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.100]   were so because they're pretty controversial.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.560]   And a lot of people don't see it the way I see it.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.780]   A lot of people do.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.620]   My own view is that even though I believe in original sin
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.060]   and guilt, that all children are conceived
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.060]   with a nature corrupted by union in Adam's fall into sin,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.820]   Romans 5, 12 following, and even though I believe
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.900]   in unconditional election so that God chose
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.460]   who would be eternally saved from the creation
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.900]   before the creation of the world,
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.900]   and even though I believe that faith in Jesus
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.180]   as the one and only Redeemer is the only way anyone
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.820]   will be able to stand before God in eternity,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.980]   even though I believe all those crucial biblical things,
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.900]   nevertheless, I also believe that all infants
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.860]   who die will be saved and spend eternity with God
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.500]   in true, full, personal joy.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   And the reason I say true, full, personal
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   is that I believe this also means God will make them mature.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.440]   They won't be irrational little tiny babies forever.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.640]   They'll grow up in some way.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.860]   God will transform them in some way,
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.800]   and I don't know how, don't even speculate about it,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   to make their joy true and full and personal
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.740]   as they know God.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.560]   They won't be non-rational infants for all eternity.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.520]   Those are my beliefs.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.280]   Now, why?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760]   You can believe anything you want, right?
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.120]   So is there any Bible underneath that?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.760]   Do we have any warrant, any biblical foundation
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.280]   for such hope?
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   And I'll give you my pointers and then my basic argument.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.800]   My pointers are that in Luke 1:15,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.640]   John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.380]   from his mother's womb.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.000]   And in Luke's theology, condemned unsaved people
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.600]   aren't filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.640]   So there's a pointer that a child,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   even in the womb, can be saved.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.940]   Psalm 22.10, David says, "On you was I cast from my birth,
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.800]   "from my mother's womb you have been my God."
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.400]   Now, those two illustrations are simply meant
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.080]   to open the door to the fact that God sees some infants
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.580]   as already in union with himself in salvation
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.580]   or either on the way, definitely, to salvation.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.040]   I think it would be a huge mistake
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.220]   to draw implications from this
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.640]   that would assume any given baby is born again.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.720]   I don't believe in baptismal regeneration.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.320]   I don't believe in baptizing babies at all.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.800]   And I certainly don't believe in it
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.680]   on the basis of any assumption
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.300]   that because they're born to Christians,
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.440]   they're born of God.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.840]   That seems to fly right in the face of Romans 9.8.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.040]   So why in the world then do I believe
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   that all infants are saved who die in infancy?
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   And the argument goes like this.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.140]   First, without evidence of God's truth,
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.140]   we would not be condemned for not believing that truth.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.640]   That's a principle that I'm gonna get from scripture
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.520]   from two texts, but just nail it down as the first premise.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.960]   Without evidence of God's truth,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.140]   that is, if we don't have that evidence,
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.680]   then we will not be condemned for not believing that truth,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.120]   which we didn't know to be the case.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.400]   Second, infants lack that evidence
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.540]   because they lack the physical capacity to construe it.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.980]   This is different from saying that all of us
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.900]   without the Holy Spirit are unable to see the truth.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.940]   That's true, and we're still guilty for it.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.820]   The difference is that our inability is moral
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.060]   and the infant's inability is physical.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.620]   We're blind because we hate the meaning we construe
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.940]   from God's revelation.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.700]   Infants are blind because they can't even construe it
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.080]   since their physical brains are not yet designed to do it.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.580]   The conclusion that no infant will be condemned
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.880]   for not believing God's truth,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.660]   that's the conclusion that I draw.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.800]   Where do I get those premises and that argument?
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   First, from John 9, 41, where Jesus is teaching
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.440]   and he's asked if he thought the Jewish leaders were blind,
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.920]   and he says, "If you were blind, you would have no guilt,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.720]   "but now you say, 'We see,' so your guilt remains."
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.640]   So that first sentence,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.600]   "If you were blind, you would have no guilt,"
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   seems to enunciate a principle
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   that in the absence of seeing that is real and physical,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.080]   you would be exempted from the responsibility of seeing
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.920]   if you're blind in the physical sense.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.520]   God would not bring a person into final judgment
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.180]   for not believing what he had no natural capacity
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.600]   or physical capacity to see.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.920]   That's the principle Jesus seems to state.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.960]   Now, I think Paul states it even more clearly
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.560]   in Romans 1, 20.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.640]   He's dealing with people who have not heard the gospel.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.480]   They have no access to the gospel.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.760]   Will they be judged?
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   And here's the way he argues.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   He says, "Well, they have access
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.300]   "to revelation of God in nature,
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.340]   "and if they didn't, then they'd have an excuse
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.180]   "at the judgment."
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.040]   So here's the text, Romans 1, 20.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.680]   "Since the creation of the world,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480]   "God's invisible attributes,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.920]   "his eternal power and divine nature,
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.560]   "have been clearly seen being understood
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.880]   "through what has been made.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.280]   "So therefore, they are without excuse."
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.080]   The reason they're without excuse,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.920]   even though they haven't heard the gospel,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.320]   is that they will only be held accountable
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.720]   for the truth they have evidence for,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.920]   namely the truth in nature.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.880]   So there's the principle again.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.140]   We are accountable, we are responsible.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.120]   We can be punished for not believing truth
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.600]   for which we have sufficient evidence.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.480]   And my point is that now children
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.440]   do not have access to any of that evidence
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.920]   concerning the truth of God.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   And it's important to stress that I'm not saying
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.440]   infants are saved because they're innocent or sinless.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.880]   I affirm that they will be saved
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.240]   in the same way we will be,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.160]   namely through the atoning work of Christ alone.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.480]   And how God will do that, I would only be guessing.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.920]   And if it helps, sometimes guesses help,
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.000]   it seems to me that the most natural guess
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.660]   would be that babies who die in infancy
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.660]   will grow up or be immediately grown up in the kingdom
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.840]   and will, by God's grace, be given the gift of faith
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.040]   as soon as they have the capacity physically for it
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.880]   so that they will be a believer all the way.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.840]   Justification will be by faith alone, just like ours.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   So that's my conviction of why they're all saved.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.680]   That's the biblical foundation for the principles behind it.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.280]   And with regard to the last little bit of the question
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.920]   about connections in heaven, let me just close like this.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.620]   At my granddaughter's funeral,
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.880]   I was given the chance to just give a granddad's perspective
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   and I said, "I believe Felicity and her great-grandfather,"
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.440]   that's my dad, "I believe Felicity and her great-grandfather
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.160]   met each other last Sunday in the presence of Christ."
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.280]   And my father said, perhaps, "Hello, Felicity.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.240]   I'm your great-grandfather, Piper.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.640]   Come, there's somebody I want you to meet.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.360]   His name is Jesus.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   He's the reason you're here.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.960]   You don't need to be afraid.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.800]   Your Savior has led you all the way.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.260]   And Jesus does all things well."
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.080]   - Amen, he does all things well.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.720]   And this reminds me about the time not long ago
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.560]   when I asked Randy Alcorn about the curious fact
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.400]   that the Bible tells us there will be children
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.920]   in the new earth.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.520]   Why would there be children in the new earth?
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.840]   He explained what this could all very well mean
