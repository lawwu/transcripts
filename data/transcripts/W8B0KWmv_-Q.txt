[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   I think it was E.B. White who said, "I rise in the morning torn between the desire to
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   enjoy the world and the desire to improve the world, and this makes it difficult to
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200]   plan the day."
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.800]   And I feel that every day.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.960]   I think, I mean, I even, I felt it this morning.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.560]   I was like, "Okay, it's time to leave to come to the Huberman podcast."
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.240]   I'm like, "Wait, but I didn't hit my minimum sunlight viewing.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.600]   What do I do?
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.440]   Do I show up on time for you or do I meet your criteria?"
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.080]   The explanation, "I was getting my morning sunlight and therefore I'm X number of minutes
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.040]   or even hours late," would have been completely fine.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   I figured as much.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.040]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.520]   That's a built-in acceptable excuse with you.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.600]   I think, I mean, I think everybody experiences a version of this, and it's definitely gotten
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.320]   worse with social media and with smartphones.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.600]   I think, so one of the most startling data points for me was Gloria Mark first put this
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.280]   on my radar.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.680]   Before COVID, the average person was checking email 72 times a day.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.420]   How do you ever concentrate for more than a couple of minutes if you're self-interrupting
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.420]   that often?
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.420]   You can't.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.780]   Brigitte Schulte has a great term for this.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.820]   She calls it time confetti.
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.600]   And she says, "We're taking these meaningful blocks of time and we're slicing them up into
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   these tiny little dots of confetti.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.560]   And not only can we not accomplish anything, we're also eroding our own sense of joy."
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.000]   Because it's really hard to enjoy the 30-second blip of time that you get on a task.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.600]   And I think we know a lot more about the existence of these problems than how to solve them.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.800]   But one thing we do know is blocking out uninterrupted time is meaningful.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.840]   There's a great Leslie Perlow experiment where she takes engineers and she has them â€“ she
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.620]   sets a quiet time policy.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.120]   No interruptions Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.600]   65% above average productivity.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.200]   Could you repeat the protocol again?
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.960]   So quiet time, there are a couple of iterations of it, but I think the most effective one
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.520]   was Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, no meetings, no interruptions, no Slack, no emails before
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.920]   noon.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.220]   And during those periods of no interruptions, one could tend to whatever their primary purpose
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.220]   is at work.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.220]   So for me, it might be podcasting.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.480]   Obviously, I don't have my phone in here, never do.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.440]   But it doesn't mean no interaction with anyone else.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800]   It just means focusing on the major task.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   The task, exactly.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   And you come in with a clear sense of priority and purpose.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.920]   And I don't think there's anything magical about Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   It's just the idea of setting a boundary and collectively committing to it that seems
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.880]   to be important.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.680]   And when I think about this, I'd be really curious about your take on chronotypes here.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.000]   Because I think one thing I've learned in the last couple of years is that if you're
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.500]   a morning person, you do your best analytical and creative thinking in the morning.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.320]   And so the quiet time block would work very well for me as a morning person.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.480]   If you're a night owl, you probably want that block in the late afternoon.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.120]   And I was encouraged, there was some evidence during COVID that people have their best meetings
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.920]   right after lunch.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.720]   That they're something like 30% less likely to multitask in an after-lunch meeting.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.160]   And I guess, you know, you could probably unpack the food coma, you know, getting re-energized
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   by other people.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.400]   But it's led me to wonder if we should all be protecting the first few hours and the
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.680]   last few hours of the day for deep work.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.600]   And then doing our core meetings and interactions and kind of off-task activities in the middle.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.280]   What do you think about that as a sequence?
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.720]   Yeah, well, I have a lot of questions about this for you.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.880]   But I love that sequence.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.800]   It certainly fits with my natural rhythms.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   I think there's ample evidence to support the fact that provided one is sleeping well
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.520]   at night and is on a more or less a standard schedule.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.720]   When I say standard, I mean going to bed somewhere between, let's say, 9.30 and 11.30 p.m.,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.260]   waking up sometime between, let's say, 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., maybe 5.30 to 7.30, something
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.260]   like that.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.720]   That's a highly unusual night out or super early bird.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.460]   For people that are following that sort of schedule, the first, let's just say from zero
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:23.200]   to eight hours after waking, there tends to be a fairly robust increase in all the catecholamines,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.420]   so dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, which generally, okay, generally speaking,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.960]   lead to increases in alertness, attention, and focus that are great for analytic work,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.080]   for implementation of strategies that you already understand, and you need to churn
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.340]   through a lot of stuff.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.320]   And of course, there's a big increase in the morning, especially if you view morning sunlight,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.540]   a healthy increase, I should say, in cortisol.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.960]   Cortisol is not bad, folks.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.920]   You want cortisol, but you want that peak early in the day.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   We know that.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.120]   Okay, so for most people, it seems, at least my understanding is that that period of time,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.780]   zero to eight hours after waking or so, is best devoted to the "most critical tasks,"
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.320]   but one of the common problems is that people take that ability to implement a known strategy
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.160]   and they start battering back all the emails.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.640]   Or talking to all, by the way, talking to coworkers is great, and it's often required,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.700]   but the question is whether or not it's productive conversation or whether or not it's just conversation.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.680]   And we tend to have a lot of energy early in the day, and I'm obsessed with the idea
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.880]   of neural energy as opposed to just caloric energy.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.380]   So there we're talking about neural energy.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.680]   And then post-lunch, so really, as we get to sort of nine to 17 hours after waking,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.680]   there is a dip in autonomic arousal that during the middle of the day, that postprandial dip,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.960]   those are post-lunch sleepiness, that can be partially offset by delaying your morning
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.120]   caffeine a bit if you have the afternoon crash.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.800]   But it's interesting that you know that more productive meetings and less task switching
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.040]   and distraction occurred in meeting set after lunch, because that makes me think that perhaps
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.080]   being a little bit less alert is going to lend itself to more focus.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.520]   And indeed, that's the sort of optimal state, relaxed but focused, you're not sleepy, but
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.640]   you also don't have so much intrinsic energy that you're tending to a bunch of things,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.720]   because I think a lot of people do feel that way.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   I mean, I'm drinking double espresso right now, late morning, and I can sit still, but
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.320]   I think certain Zoom meetings, how do I say this?
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.600]   I don't want to offend any of my colleagues.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.880]   I mean, they are boring enough.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.640]   They are not content rich enough to grab all my attention.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.280]   And nowadays, of course, there are multiple screens.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.240]   Typically, I've got two phones and a computer, and you have to really spend some work to
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.800]   flip over those phones while I'm on a Zoom and things like that.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   I'm sorry, what were you saying?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   That was my mistake.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.400]   So it's maybe the reduction in autonomic arousal that supports what you just described, but
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.400]   My thinking, or my understanding rather, was that creative work and kind of brainstorming
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.200]   was best accomplished in the late afternoon.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.680]   I've noticed when lecturing, I'd be curious what your experience is with in university
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.640]   lectures when I held courses in the evening, I used to like to hold my courses 5 to 7 PM
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.480]   or even 7 to 9.30 PM when I was teaching undergraduates, that people were much looser and more relaxed.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.460]   And I always thought that that might have something to do with an increase in GABA transmission
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.640]   that's known to happen in late evening, that people are just kind of more relaxed and less
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.640]   social anxiety.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.520]   They've been around people for much of the day.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.560]   I send back more reflections than answers.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.960]   I don't have any firm neuroscience explanations for what you described, but there are some
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.400]   emerging theories about how that might work, and it has this 0 to 9 hours, phase one, 9
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.200]   to 17 hours, phase two, and then of course, from 17 to 24 hours, I'll call it phase three,
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   you should be asleep.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Ideally.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.520]   Well, I think there's a confound in your teaching experience, which is undergrads often sleep
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.800]   in until what, noon, or they might be up until 4 AM.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.880]   Or at least 10 AM seems to be a typical rise time for the undergrad.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.440]   So morning class might be too early for them to be fully awake, but there's some brand
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.920]   new evidence that at least on creativity at work, I read a series of, I think it was three
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.240]   studies recently showing that early birds actually did do more creative work in the
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.600]   morning.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.820]   And in part, I think, again, I don't think any neuroscientist has touched the mechanisms
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.400]   on this yet, but in terms of the psychological processes, early on, there seems to be a benefit
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   of the energy level, and some of that energy leads to more divergent thinking.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.440]   And later, if you're a morning person, you might lose the ability to diverge quite as
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   much.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.240]   And so you end up in a more conventional space of thought.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.660]   Does that track at all with your understanding of how it might play out in the brain?
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.960]   My understanding is it'd be a little bit, it would be individual, but there is something
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.880]   to these liminal states between sleep and waking.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.080]   So maybe we can wrap a convenient bow around what I said and what you just said, which
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:14.680]   is that we know that in the transition states into and out of sleep, and it doesn't necessarily
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.000]   have to be within the first half hour in and out of sleep, that there seems to be more
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.320]   divergent thinking, or at least activation of neural networks that are not as constrained
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:37.880]   as one observes when they're in a sheer task and strategy implementation mode.
