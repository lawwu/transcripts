[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.360]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.280]   Today, we're talking about neural plasticity,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.640]   which is this incredible feature of our nervous systems
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.340]   that allows it to change in response to experience.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.280]   Neural plasticity is arguably
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.580]   one of the most important aspects of our biology.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.140]   It holds the promise for each and all of us
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.760]   to think differently, to learn new things,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280]   to forget painful experiences,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.960]   and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.400]   by becoming better.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   So let's get started.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.160]   Most people are familiar with the word neural plasticity,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.680]   which is the brain and nervous system's ability
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.600]   to change itself.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.280]   All of us were born with a nervous system
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.500]   that isn't just capable of change,
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.960]   but was designed to change.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.480]   When we enter the world,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.120]   our nervous system is primed for learning.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.240]   The brain and nervous system of a baby
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.600]   is wired very crudely.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.920]   The connections are not precise.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.680]   And we can see evidence of that
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.480]   in the fact that babies are kind of flopping there
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.680]   like a little potato bug with limbs.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680]   They can't really do much in terms of coordinated movement.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.720]   They certainly can't speak
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.580]   and they can't really do anything with precision.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.800]   So I want you to imagine in your mind
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.840]   that when you were brought into this world,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.800]   you were essentially a widely connected web of connections
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.760]   that was really poor at doing any one thing.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.320]   And that through your experience,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.560]   what you were exposed to by your parents or other caretakers
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.520]   through your social interactions, through your thoughts,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.240]   through the languages that you learn,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.480]   through the places you traveled or didn't travel,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.780]   your nervous system became customized
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200]   to your unique experience.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.820]   Now, that's true for certain parts of your brain
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.080]   that are involved in what we call
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.600]   representations of the outside world.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.480]   A lot of your brain is designed to represent the visual world
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.880]   or represent the auditory world
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.600]   or represent the gallery of smells
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.320]   that are possible in the world.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.760]   However, there are aspects of your nervous system
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.880]   that were designed not to be plastic.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.840]   They were wired so that plasticity
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.800]   or changes in those circuits is very unlikely.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.860]   Those circuits include things like
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.780]   the ones that control your heartbeat,
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.640]   the ones that control your breathing,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400]   the ones that control your digestion.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.180]   And thank goodness that those circuits were set up that way
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.000]   because you want those circuits to be extremely reliable.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.040]   So many nervous system features like digestion
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.900]   and breathing and heart rate are hard to change.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.320]   Other aspects of our nervous system
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.000]   are actually quite easy to change.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.960]   And one of the great gifts of childhood,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.840]   adolescence, and young adulthood
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.260]   is that we can learn through almost passive experience.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.000]   We don't have to focus that hard
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.540]   in order to learn new things.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.680]   And then after age 25,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.540]   if we want to change those connections,
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.640]   those super highways of connectivity,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.720]   we have to engage in some very specific processes.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   And those processes, as we'll soon learn, are gated,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.320]   meaning you can't just decide to change your brain.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.360]   You actually have to go through a series of steps
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.440]   to change your internal state
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   in ways that will allow you to change your brain.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.920]   Many of us have been captivated
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.860]   by the stories in the popular press
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.640]   about the addition of new neurons.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.020]   This idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise,
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.440]   your brain actually makes new neurons.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.880]   Well, I'm going to give you the bad news,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.080]   which is that after puberty,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.960]   the human brain and nervous system
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.240]   adds very few, if any, new neurons.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.400]   So even though we can't add new neurons
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.680]   throughout our lifespan,
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.800]   at least not in very great numbers,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.200]   it's clear that we can change our nervous system,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   that the nervous system is available for change,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.920]   that if we create the right set of circumstances
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.440]   in our brain, chemical circumstances,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.480]   and if we create the right environmental circumstances
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.580]   around us, our nervous system will shift into a mode
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.220]   in which change isn't just possible, but it's probable.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.860]   As I mentioned before,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.200]   the hallmark of the child nervous system is change.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.420]   It wants to change.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.880]   One of the ways in which we can all get plasticity
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.160]   at any stage throughout the lifespan
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.120]   is through deficits and impairments
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.280]   in what we call our sensory apparati,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.740]   our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.160]   In individuals that are blind from birth,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.900]   the so-called occipital cortex,
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.680]   the visual cortex in the back,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.480]   becomes overtaken by hearing.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.200]   The neurons there will start to respond to sounds
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.600]   as well as braille touch.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.420]   And actually there's a one particularly tragic incident
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.660]   where a woman who was blind since birth
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.200]   and because of neuroimaging studies,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.040]   we knew her visual cortex was no longer visual,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.380]   it was responsible for braille reading and for hearing.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.400]   She had a stroke that actually took out
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.680]   most of the function of her visual cortex.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.720]   So then she was blind, she couldn't braille read or hear.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.160]   She did recover some aspect of function.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   Now, most people, they don't end up
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.520]   in that highly unfortunate situation.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.780]   And what we know is that, for instance,
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.280]   blind people who use their visual cortex
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.360]   for braille reading and for hearing
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.880]   have much better auditory acuity and touch acuity,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.900]   meaning they can sense things with their fingers
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.680]   and they can sense things with their hearing
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.940]   that typical sighted folks wouldn't be able to.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.720]   In fact, you will find a much greater incidence
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.840]   of perfect pitch in people that are blind.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.920]   And that tells us that the brain,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.100]   and in particular this area we call the neocortex,
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.440]   which is the outer part,
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.320]   is really designed to be a map
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.560]   of our own individual experience.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.620]   So these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss,
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.440]   where somebody is blind from birth or deaf from birth,
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   or maybe has a limb development impairment
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.020]   where they have a stump instead of an entire limb
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.920]   with a functioning hand,
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.600]   their brain will represent the body plan that they have,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   not some other body plan.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.020]   But the beauty of the situation
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.520]   is that the real estate up in the skull, that neocortex,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.360]   the essence of it is to be a customized map of experience.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.600]   A few years ago, I was at a course
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.840]   and a woman came up to me and she said,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.500]   "I wasn't teaching the course, I was in the course."
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.840]   And she said, "I just have to tell you
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.160]   that every time you speak, it really stresses me out."
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.380]   And I said, "Well, I've heard that before,
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.500]   but do you want to be more specific?"
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.700]   And she said, "Yeah, your tone of voice reminds me
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.160]   of somebody that I had a really terrible experience with."
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.860]   I said, "Well, okay, well, I can't change my voice,
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.200]   but I really appreciate that you acknowledge that,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.700]   and it also will help explain why you seem to cringe
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.000]   every time I speak," which I hadn't noticed until then.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   But after that, I did notice she had a very immediate
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.640]   and kind of visceral response to my speech.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.720]   But in any event, over the period of this two-week course,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   she would come back every once in a while and say,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.920]   "You know what, I think just by telling you
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.960]   that your voice was really difficult for me to listen to,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.900]   it's actually becoming more tolerable to me."
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.820]   And by the end, we actually became pretty good friends,
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.900]   and we're still in touch.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.380]   And so what this says is that the recognition of something,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.980]   whether or not that's an emotional thing
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.100]   or a desire to learn something else,
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.860]   is actually the first step in neuroplasticity.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.020]   If I get up out of this chair and walk out of the door,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.820]   I don't think about each step that I'm taking,
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.420]   and that's because I learned how to walk during development.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.580]   But when we decide that we're going to shift
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.660]   some sort of behavior or some reaction
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.080]   or some new piece of information that we want to learn
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.600]   is something that we want to bring into our consciousness,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   that awareness is a remarkable thing
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.240]   because it cues the brain
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.960]   and the rest of the nervous system
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.560]   that when we engage in those reflexive actions going forward,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.080]   that those reflexive actions
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.480]   are no longer fated to be reflexive.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.800]   Now, if this sounds a little bit abstract,
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.080]   we're going to talk about protocols for how to do this.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.440]   But the first step in neuroplasticity
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.820]   is recognizing that you want to change something.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.900]   We have to know what it is exactly that we want to change.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.440]   Or if we don't know exactly what it is
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.400]   that we want to change,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.680]   we at least have to know that we want to change something
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.440]   about some specific experience.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.720]   Now, there are specific protocols
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.480]   that science tells us we have to follow
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.280]   if we want those changes to occur.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.440]   What it is is it's our forebrain,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.360]   in particular our prefrontal cortex,
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.520]   signaling the rest of our nervous system
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.280]   that something that we're about to do,
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.360]   hear, feel, or experience is worth paying attention to.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.520]   So we'll pause there, and then I'm going to move forward.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.040]   One of the biggest lies in the universe
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.200]   that seems quite prominent right now
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.100]   is that every experience you have changes your brain.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.280]   People love to say this.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.480]   They love to say your brain is going to be different
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.440]   after this lecture,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.600]   that your brain is going to be different
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.800]   after today's class than it was two days ago.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.160]   And that's absolutely not true.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.400]   The nervous system doesn't just change
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.600]   because you experience something
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.120]   unless you're a very young child.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.840]   The nervous system changes
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   when certain neurochemicals are released
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.800]   and allow whatever neurons are active in the period
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.840]   in which those chemicals are swimming around
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.000]   to strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.360]   So when people tell you,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.160]   "Oh, at the end of today's lecture
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.560]   or at the end of something,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.680]   your brain is going to be completely different,"
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.760]   that's simply not true.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.960]   If you're older than 25, your brain will not change
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.560]   unless there's a selective shift in your attention
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.320]   or a selective shift in your experience
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.080]   that tells the brain it's time to change.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.480]   And those changes occur through strengthening
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.640]   and weakening of particular connections.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.740]   But the important thing to understand
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.040]   is that if we want something to change,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.380]   we really need to bring an immense amount of attention
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.560]   to whatever it is that we want to change.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.040]   This is very much linked to the statement I made earlier
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   about it all starts with an awareness.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.520]   Now, why is that attention important?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.240]   In the early '90s,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.320]   a graduate student by the name of Greg Rechenzone
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.200]   was in the laboratory of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.800]   And they set out to test this idea
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.400]   that if one wants to change their brain,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.960]   they need to do it early in life
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.360]   because the adult brain simply isn't plastic.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.800]   It's not available for these changes.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.540]   And they did a series of absolutely beautiful experiments.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.040]   By now, I think we can say proving
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.540]   that the adult brain can change
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.080]   provided certain conditions are met.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.460]   Now, the experiments they did are tough.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.740]   They were tough on the experimenter
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.200]   and they were tough on the subject.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.480]   I'll just describe one.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.200]   Let's say you were a subject in one of their experiments.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.320]   You would come into the lab and you'd sit down at a table
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.720]   and they would record from or image your brain
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.860]   and look at the representation of your fingers,
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.000]   the digits as we call them.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.660]   And there would be a spinning drum,
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.680]   literally like a stone drum in front of you
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.800]   or metal drum that had little bumps.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   Some of the bumps were spaced close together,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.720]   some of them were spaced far apart.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.420]   And they would do these experiments
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.600]   where they would expect their subjects
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.880]   to press a lever whenever, for instance,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.400]   the bumps got closer together or further apart.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.200]   And these were very subtle differences.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.040]   So in order to do this,
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.080]   you really have to pay attention
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.020]   to the distance between the bumps.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.600]   And these were not braille readers
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.460]   or anyone skilled in doing these kinds of experiments.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.520]   What they found was that as people paid
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.160]   more and more attention to the distance between these bumps,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.660]   and they would signal when there was a change
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.560]   by pressing a lever.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.240]   As they did that, there was very rapid changes,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.520]   plasticity in the representation of the fingers.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.120]   And it could go in either direction.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   You could get people very good
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.200]   at detecting the distance between bumps
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.680]   that the distance was getting smaller
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.040]   or the distance was getting greater.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.880]   So people could get very good at these tasks
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.440]   that you're kind of hard to imagine
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.920]   how they would translate to the real world
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.200]   for a non-braille reader.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.520]   But what it told us is that these maps of touch
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.000]   were very much available for plasticity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.520]   And these were fully adult subjects.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.320]   What it proved is that the adult brain is very plastic.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.440]   And they did some beautiful control experiments
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.520]   that are important for everyone to understand,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.160]   which is that sometimes they would bring people in
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.940]   and they would have them touch these bumps
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.560]   on this spinning drum,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.240]   but they would have the person pay attention
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.440]   to an auditory cue.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.920]   Every time a tone would go off,
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.400]   or there was a shift in the pitch of that tone,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.700]   they would have to signal that.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.080]   So the subject thought they were doing something
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.240]   related to touch and hearing.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.120]   And all that showed was that it wasn't just the mere action
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.840]   of touching these bumps.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.120]   They had to pay attention to the bumps themselves.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.280]   If they were placing their attention
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.360]   on the auditory cue on the tone,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.880]   well, then there was plasticity
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.780]   in the auditory portion of the brain,
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.640]   but not on the touch portion of the brain.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.320]   And this really spits in the face of this thing
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   that you hear so often,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.600]   which is every experience that you have
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.400]   is going to change the way your brain works.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.520]   Absolutely not.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.120]   The experiences that you pay super careful attention to
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.160]   are what open up plasticity.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.520]   And it opens up plasticity to that specific experience.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.120]   So the question then is why?
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.680]   And Merzenich and his graduate students and postdocs
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.000]   went on to address this question of why.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.880]   And it turns out the answer
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.040]   is a very straightforward neurochemical answer.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.420]   And the first neurochemical is epinephrine, also adrenaline.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.920]   We call it adrenaline when it's released
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.400]   from the adrenal glands above our kidneys,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.220]   that's in the body.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.680]   We call it epinephrine in the brain,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.480]   but they are chemically identical substances.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.720]   Epinephrine is released from a region in the brainstem
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.640]   called locus coeruleus.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.120]   Epinephrine is released when we pay attention
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.020]   and when we are alert.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.520]   But the most important thing for getting plasticity
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.880]   is that there be epinephrine, which equates to alertness,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.720]   plus the release of this neuromodulator acetylcholine.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.800]   Now, acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   One is also in the brainstem
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.240]   and it's named different things in different animals,
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.440]   but in humans, the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.240]   or neurons that make acetylcholine
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.200]   is the parabigeminal nucleus or the parabrachial region.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.480]   All you need to know is that you have an area
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.400]   in your brainstem and that area sends wires,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.160]   these axons up into the area of the brain
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.480]   that filters sensory input.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.560]   So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.960]   and it is getting bombarded
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.200]   with all sorts of sensory input all the time.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   But when I pay attention to something,
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.800]   I create a cone of attention,
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.960]   what we call signal to noise goes up.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.640]   So those of you with an engineering background
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.240]   will be familiar with signal to noise.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.960]   Those of you who do not have an engineering background,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.800]   don't worry about it.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.180]   All it means is that one particular shout in the crowd
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.480]   comes through, acetylcholine acts as a spotlight.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.680]   But epinephrine for alertness,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.160]   acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs,
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.360]   those two things alone are not enough to get plasticity.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.000]   There needs to be this third component.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.440]   And the third component is acetylcholine released
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.920]   from an area of the forebrain called nucleus basalis.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.040]   If you really want to get technical,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.960]   it's called nucleus basalis of minert.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.480]   For any of you that are budding physicians
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.860]   or going to medical school, you should know that.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.820]   If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem,
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.120]   acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis and epinephrine,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.460]   you can change your brain.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.800]   And this has been shown again and again and again
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.200]   in a variety of papers.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.920]   And it is now considered a fundamental principle
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.280]   of how the nervous system works.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.560]   If you can access these three things of epinephrine,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.040]   acetylcholine from these two sources,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.720]   not only will the nervous system change, it has to change.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.160]   It absolutely will change.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.880]   And that is the most important thing
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.800]   for people to understand if they want to change their brain.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.160]   So now let's talk about how we would translate
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.180]   all the scientific information into some protocols
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.440]   that you can actually apply.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.200]   Because I think that's what many of you are interested in.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.900]   What you do with your health and your medical care
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.740]   is up to you.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.600]   You're responsible for your health and wellbeing.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.440]   So I'm not going to tell you what to do or what to take.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.260]   I'm going to describe what the literature tells us
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.960]   and suggests about ways to access plasticity.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.320]   We know we need epinephrine.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.580]   That means alertness.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.920]   Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.080]   and a good night's sleep.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.800]   So I will say you should master your sleep schedule
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.160]   and you should figure out how much sleep you need
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.920]   in order to achieve alertness when you sit down to learn.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.300]   But once that's in place,
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.700]   the question then is how do I access this alertness?
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.140]   Well, there are a number of ways.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.680]   Some people use some pretty elaborate
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.200]   psychological gymnastics.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.160]   They will tell people that they're going to do something
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.840]   and create some accountability.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.060]   That could be really good.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.200]   Or they'll post a picture of themselves online
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.240]   and they'll commit to learning a certain amount,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.840]   losing, excuse me, a certain amount of weight
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.000]   or something like this.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.480]   So they can use either shame-based practices
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.040]   to potentially embarrass themselves
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   if they don't follow through.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.200]   They'll write checks to organizations that they hate
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.500]   and insist that they'll cash them
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.400]   if they don't actually follow through.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.020]   Or they'll do it out of love.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.680]   They'll decide that they're going to run a marathon
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.820]   or learn a language or something
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.100]   because of somebody they love
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.280]   or they want to devote it to somebody.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.780]   The truth is that from the standpoint of epinephrine
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.700]   and getting alert and activated,
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.620]   it doesn't really matter.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.080]   Epinephrine is a chemical
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.300]   and your brain does not distinguish
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.420]   between doing things out of love or hate, anger, or fear.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.260]   It really doesn't.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.220]   All of those promote autonomic arousal
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.460]   and the release of epinephrine.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.060]   So I think for most people,
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.460]   if you're feeling not motivated to make these changes,
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.820]   the key thing is to identify not just one,
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.940]   but probably a kit of reasons,
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.860]   several reasons as to why you would want
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.540]   to make this particular change.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.380]   And being drawn toward a particular goal
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.940]   that you're excited about can be one.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.980]   Also being motivated to not be completely afraid,
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.780]   ashamed, or humiliated for not falling through
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.140]   on a goal is another.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.700]   Come up with two or three things,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.480]   fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps,
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.480]   or perhaps several of those in order to ensure alertness,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.940]   energy, and attention for the task.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.100]   And that brings us to the attention part.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.460]   Now, it's one thing to have an electrode
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.420]   embedded into your brain
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.840]   and increase the amount of acetylcholine.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.660]   It's another to exist in the real world
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.860]   outside the laboratory and have trouble focusing,
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.020]   having trouble bringing your attention
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.620]   to a particular location in space for a particular event.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.660]   And there's a lot of discussion nowadays
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.220]   about smartphones and devices
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.280]   creating a sort of attention deficit,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.220]   almost at a clinical level for many people,
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.780]   including adults.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.580]   I think that's largely true.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.300]   And what it means, however,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.060]   is that we all are responsible for learning
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.940]   how to create depth of focus.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.900]   There are some important neuroscience principles
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.820]   to get depth of focus.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.060]   I want to briefly talk about the pharmacology first,
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.420]   because I always get asked about this.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.780]   People say, "What can I take
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.840]   to increase my levels of acetylcholine?"
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.600]   Well, there are things you can take.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.260]   Nicotine is called nicotine
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.740]   because acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.460]   There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.540]   muscarinic and nicotinic,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.020]   but the nicotinic ones are involved
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.740]   in attention and alertness.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.140]   I have colleagues,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.720]   these are not my kind of like bro science buddies,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.220]   I have those friends too.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.100]   This is a Nobel prize winning colleague
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.340]   who chews Nicorette while he works.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.660]   But when I asked him, "Why are you doing this?"
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.700]   He said, "Well, increases my alertness and focus."
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.940]   Now, I've tried chewing Nicorette,
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.540]   it makes me super jittery.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.880]   I don't like it because I can't focus very well.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.240]   It kind of takes me too far up
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.020]   the level of autonomic arousal.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.420]   I've got friends that dip Nicorette all day.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.980]   If you're going to go down that route,
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.420]   you want to be very careful
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.940]   how much you rely on those all the time,
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.500]   because the essence of plasticity
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.840]   is to create a window of attention and focus
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.980]   that's distinct from the rest of your day.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.220]   So what are some ways that you can increase acetylcholine?
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.980]   How do you increase focus?
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.320]   The best way to get better at focusing
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.780]   is to use the mechanisms of focus that you were born with.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.660]   And the key principle here
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.620]   is that mental focus follows visual focus.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.080]   We are all familiar with the fact
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.260]   that our visual system can be unfocused, blurry,
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.780]   or jumping around,
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.760]   or we can be very laser focused on one location in space.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.200]   What's interesting and vitally important
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.940]   to understanding how to access neuroplasticity
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.760]   is that you can use your visual focus
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.180]   and you can increase your visual focus
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.900]   as a way of increasing your mental focus abilities
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.060]   more broadly.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.700]   So I'm going to explain how to do that.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.380]   Plasticity starts with alertness.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.540]   That alertness can come from a sense of love,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.700]   a sense of joy, a sense of fear, doesn't matter.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.000]   There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness too.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.620]   The most common one is of course caffeine.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.260]   Many people are now also using Adderall.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.860]   Adderall will not increase focus, it increases alertness.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.280]   It does not touch the acetylcholine system.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.060]   The acetylcholine system and the focus that it brings
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.260]   is available, as I mentioned, through pharmacology,
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.540]   but also through these behavioral practices.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.460]   And the behavioral practices that are anchored
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.560]   in visual focus are going to be the ones
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.700]   that are going to allow you to develop great depth
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.660]   and duration of focus.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.420]   So let's think about visual focus for a second.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.100]   When we focus on something visually, we have two options.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.680]   We can either look at a very small region of space
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.500]   with a lot of detail and a lot of precision,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.220]   or we can dilate our gaze and we can see big pieces
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.160]   of visual space with very little detail.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.000]   It's a trade-off.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.100]   We can't look at everything at high resolution.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.060]   This is why we have these, the pupil more or less relates
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.460]   to the fovea of the eye, which is the area
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.940]   in which we have the most receptors,
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.940]   the highest density of receptors that perceive light.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.140]   And so our acuity is much better in the center
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.620]   of our visual field than in our periphery.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.500]   When we focus our eyes, we do a couple things.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.980]   First of all, we tend to do that in the center
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.220]   of our visual field, and our two eyes tend to align
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.620]   in what's called avergence eye movement
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.740]   towards a common point.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.080]   The other thing that happens is the lens of our eye moves
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.880]   so that our brain now no longer sees the entire visual world
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.480]   but is seeing a small cone of visual imagery.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.840]   That small cone of visual imagery or soda straw view
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.040]   of the world has much higher acuity, higher resolution
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.680]   than if I were to look at everything.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.760]   Now you say, of course, this makes perfect sense,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.280]   but that's about visual attention, not mental attention.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   Well, it turns out that focus in the brain is anchored
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.760]   to our visual system.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.300]   I'll talk about blind people in a moment,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.940]   but assuming that somebody is sighted,
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.180]   the key is to learn how to focus better visually
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.020]   if you want to bring about higher levels
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.860]   of cognitive or mental focus.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.060]   When we move our eyes slightly inward,
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.260]   maybe you can tell that I'm doing this like so,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.220]   basically shortening or making the interpupillary distance
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.140]   as it's called smaller, two things happen.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.380]   Not only do we develop a smaller visual window
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.220]   into the world, but we activate a set of neurons
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.100]   in our brainstem that trigger the release
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.220]   of both norepinephrine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.380]   Norepinephrine is kind of similar to epinephrine.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.680]   So in other words, when our eyes are relaxed in our head,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.520]   when we're just kind of looking
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.740]   at our entire visual environment,
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.620]   moving our head around, moving through space,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.900]   we're in optic flow, things moving past us,
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.220]   or we're sitting still, we're looking broadly at our space,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.860]   we're relaxed.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.300]   When our eyes move slightly inward
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.200]   toward a particular visual target,
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   our visual world shrinks, our level of visual focus goes up,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.940]   and we know that this relates to the release
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.780]   of acetylcholine and epinephrine at the relevant sites
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.940]   in the brain for plasticity.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.740]   Now, what this means is that if you have a hard time
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.320]   focusing your mind for sake of reading or for listening,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.820]   you need to practice and you can practice
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.900]   focusing your visual system.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.460]   Now, this works best if you practice
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.540]   focusing your visual system at the precise distance
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.740]   from the work that you intend to do for sake of plasticity.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.940]   So how would this look in the real world?
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.260]   Let's say I am trying to concentrate
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.300]   on something related to, I don't know, science.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.100]   I'm reading a science paper and I'm having a hard time,
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.820]   it's not absorbing.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.220]   Spending just 60 to 120 seconds
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.620]   focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen,
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.420]   meaning just on my screen with nothing on it,
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.780]   but bringing my eyes to that particular location
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.020]   increases not just my visual acuity for that location,
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.180]   but it brings about an increase in activity
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.540]   in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.060]   with gathering information from this location.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.020]   So put simply, if you want to improve
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.780]   your ability to focus, practice visual focus.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.340]   Now, you may ask, well, what about the experiment
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.660]   where people were feeling this rotating drum
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.940]   or listening to the auditory cue?
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.300]   That doesn't involve vision at all.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.860]   Ah, if you look at people who are learning things
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.320]   with their auditory system,
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.900]   they will often close their eyes.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.440]   And that's not a coincidence.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.180]   If somebody is listening very hard,
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.100]   please don't ask them to look you directly in the eye
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.060]   while also asking that they listen to you.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.480]   That's actually one of the worst ways
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.320]   to get somebody to listen to you.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.620]   If you say, now listen to me and look me in the eye,
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.820]   the visual system will take over
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.980]   and they'll see your mouth move,
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.140]   but they're going to hear their thoughts
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.780]   more than they're going to hear what you're saying.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.080]   Closing the eyes is one of the best ways
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.700]   to create a cone of auditory attention.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.280]   And this is what low vision or no vision folks do.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.140]   They have tremendous capacity to focus their attention
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.660]   in particular locations.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.320]   And for most people, vision is the primary way
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.980]   to train up this focus ability in these cones of attention.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.960]   So you absolutely have to focus on the thing
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.180]   that you're trying to learn.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.460]   And you will feel some agitation
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.100]   because of the epinephrine in your system.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.180]   If you're feeling agitation and it's challenging to focus
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.720]   and you're feeling like you're not doing it right,
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.780]   chances are you're doing it right.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.820]   So once you get this epinephrine, this alertness,
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.900]   you get the acetylcholine released
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.620]   and you can focus your attention.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.220]   Then the question is for how long?
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.720]   And in an earlier podcast,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.460]   I talked about these ultradian cycles
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.220]   that last about 90 minutes.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.240]   The typical learning bout should be about 90 minutes.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.140]   I think that learning bout will no doubt include
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.140]   five to 10 minutes of warmup period.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.380]   I think everyone should give themselves permission
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.940]   to not be fully focused in the early part of that bout,
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.820]   but that in the middle of that bout,
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.780]   for the middle hour or so,
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.420]   you should be able to maintain focus
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.820]   for about an hour or so.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.460]   So that for me means eliminating distractions.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.300]   That means turning off the Wi-Fi.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.820]   I put my phone in the other room.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.720]   I encourage you to try experiencing what it is
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.860]   to be completely immersed in an activity
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.320]   where you feel the agitation
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.400]   that your attention is drifting,
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.980]   but you continually bring it back.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.180]   And that's an important point,
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.020]   which is that attention drifts,
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.300]   but we have to re-anchor it.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.780]   We have to keep grabbing it back.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.460]   And the way to do that, if you're sighted,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.660]   is with your eyes.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.460]   That as your attention drifts and you look away,
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.700]   you want to try and literally maintain visual focus
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.100]   on the thing that you're trying to learn.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.360]   That's the trigger for plasticity.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.020]   But the real secret is that neural plasticity
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.700]   doesn't occur during wakefulness.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.820]   It occurs during sleep.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.820]   We now know that if you focus very hard on something
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.300]   for about 90 minutes or so,
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.380]   maybe you even do several bouts of that per day,
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.060]   if you can do that.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:40.900]   Some people can.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.220]   Some people can only do one focused bout of learning.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.040]   That night and the following nights while you sleep,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.980]   the neural circuits that were highlighted, if you will,
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.900]   with acetylcholine transmission will strengthen
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.000]   and other ones will be lost,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.040]   which is wonderful because that's the essence of plasticity.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.780]   And what it means is that when you eventually wake up
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.980]   a couple of days or a week later,
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.780]   you will have acquired the knowledge forever.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.380]   Unless you go through some process to actively unlearn it.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.820]   So mastering sleep is key
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.860]   in order to reinforce the learning that occurs.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.140]   But let's say you get a really poor night of sleep
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.940]   after a bout of learning.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.380]   Chances are, if you sleep the next night
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.460]   or the following night, that learning will occur.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.940]   There's a stamp in the brain
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.540]   where this acetylcholine was released.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.520]   It actually marks those synapses neurochemically
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.220]   and metabolically so that those synapses
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.860]   are more biased to change.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.100]   Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep,
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.400]   then you probably won't get those changes.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.540]   There's also a way in which you can bypass the need
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.340]   for deep sleep, at least partially,
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.580]   by engaging in what I call non-sleep deep rest,
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.420]   these NSDR protocols.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.860]   But I just want to discuss the science of this.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.900]   There was a paper that was published
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.100]   in Cell Reports last year that shows that if people did,
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.420]   it was a spatial memory task,
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.260]   actually quite difficult one where they had to remember
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.340]   the sequence of lights lighting up.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.900]   And if they're just two or three lights
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.100]   in a particular sequence, it's easy.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.900]   But as you get up to 15 or 16 lights
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.060]   and numbers in the sequence,
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.860]   it actually gets quite challenging.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.300]   If immediately after, and it was immediately after
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.020]   the learning, the actual performance of this task,
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   people took a 20 minute non-sleep deep rest protocol
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.000]   or took a shallow nap.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.580]   So lying down, feet slightly elevated, perhaps,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.340]   just closing their eyes, no sensory input.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.820]   The rates of learning were significantly higher
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.860]   for that information than were to just had a good night's
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.200]   sleep the following night.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.820]   So you can actually accelerate learning
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.420]   with these NSDR protocols or with brief naps,
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.980]   90 minutes or less.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.040]   For many people, letting the mind drift
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.220]   where it's not organized in thought
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.860]   after a period of very deliberate focused effort
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.700]   is the best way to accelerate learning
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.620]   and depth of learning.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.480]   I want to synthesize some of the information
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.100]   that we've covered up until now.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.120]   Today, I want to make sure that these key elements
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.620]   that form the backbone of neuroplasticity
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.140]   are really embedded in people's minds.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.180]   First of all, plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.660]   If you want to learn as an adult, you have to be alert.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.900]   It might seem so obvious,
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.420]   but I think a lot of people don't think about
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.640]   when in their 24 hour cycle, they're most alert.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.540]   Just ask yourself, when during the day
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.620]   do you typically tend to be most alert?
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.380]   That will afford you an advantage
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.340]   in learning specific things during that period of time.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.120]   So don't give up that period of time
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.680]   for things that are meaningless, useless,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.240]   or not aligned with your goals.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.280]   That epinephrine released from your brainstem
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.960]   is going to occur more readily
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.600]   at particular phases of your 24 hour cycle
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.120]   than others during the waking phase, of course.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.660]   You should know when those are.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.160]   Increasing acetylcholine can be accomplished
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.220]   pharmacologically through nicotine.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.500]   However, there are certain dangers
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.260]   for many people to do that, as well as a cost.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.340]   Financial cost.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.080]   Learning how to engage the cholinergic system
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.540]   through the use of the visual system.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.480]   Practicing, how long can you maintain focus
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.560]   with blinks as you need them?
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.800]   But how long can you maintain visual focus
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.560]   on a target, just on a piece of paper,
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.740]   set a few feet away in the room
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.440]   or at the level of your computer screen?
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.920]   These are actually things that people do in communities
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.460]   where high levels of visual focus are necessary.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.680]   What we're really talking about here
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.360]   is trying to harness the mechanisms of attention
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.400]   and get better at paying attention.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.060]   You may want to do that with your auditory system,
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.740]   not with your visual system,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.120]   either because you're low vision or no vision,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.480]   or because you're trying to learn something
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.840]   that relates more to sounds.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.760]   You should also ask yourself whether or not
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.440]   you're trying to focus too much for too long during the day.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.400]   I know some very high-performing individuals,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.160]   very high-performing in a variety of contexts,
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.040]   and none of them are focused all day long.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.240]   Many of them take walks down the hallway,
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.520]   sometimes mumbling to themselves
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.000]   or not paying attention to anything else.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.180]   They go for bike rides, they take walks.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.480]   They are not trying to engage their mind
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.920]   at maximum focus all the time.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.800]   Very few people do that
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.440]   because we learn best in these 90-minute bouts
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.500]   inside of one of these ultradian cycles.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.620]   And I should repeat again that within that 90-minute cycle,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.180]   you should not expect yourself to focus
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.240]   for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.500]   The beginning and end are going to be a little bit flickering
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.680]   in and out of focus.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.880]   How do you know when one of these 90-minute cycles
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.320]   is starting?
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.360]   Well, typically when you wake up
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.960]   is the beginning of the first 90-minute cycle,
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.640]   but it's not down to the minute.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.960]   You'll be able to tap into your sense
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.040]   of these 90-minute cycles
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.720]   as you start to engage in these learning practices,
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.280]   should you choose.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.680]   And then of course, getting some non-sleep deep rest
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.880]   or just deliberate disengagement,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   such as walking or running or just sitting,
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.240]   eyes closed or eyes open kind of mindlessly,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.360]   it might seem in a chair,
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.720]   just letting your thoughts move around
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.400]   after a learning about will accelerate
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.600]   the rate of plasticity.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.840]   And then of course, deep sleep.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.680]   Many of you have very graciously asked
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.860]   how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.440]   Best way to do that is to subscribe on YouTube.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.560]   You might want to also hit the notification button
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.580]   so that you don't miss any upcoming episodes.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.800]   Leave a comment.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.340]   As well, if you go to Apple,
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.280]   you can give us a five-star rating
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.320]   and there's a place there where also you can leave a comment.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.080]   And if you prefer to listen on Spotify,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.560]   subscribe and download on Spotify.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.640]   In addition, it's always helpful if you recommend the podcast
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.440]   to your friends and family and others
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.120]   who you think might benefit from the information.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.160]   And as well, please check out our sponsors.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.560]   That's a great way to help us.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.020]   Thanks so much for your time and attention.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.900]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
