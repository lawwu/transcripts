[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   NBA players have access to excess, and most people don't have that.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.900]   And so for the person on the outside who's like, I would never do that.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.780]   First of all, you don't got the money.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.900]   You're not in a different city pretty much every night with your own hotel room.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.500]   You don't know what it's like to have girls waiting in the lobby for you.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.840]   Right.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.000]   That are the baddest you've ever seen saying, take both of us upstairs and let's get it popping.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.520]   Yeah, you don't have to worry about that.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.880]   You get to live a very quiet, peaceful, chill life day to day and be around the same people.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.720]   For us, it's just different.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.080]   That character development, it has to be way more intentional if you want to live a life of integrity.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.900]   The majority of guys in the industry, they're not trying to live a life of integrity.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.460]   So these are the guys you're around every single day, and it's really hard to completely walk a different direction.
