[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Financial Samurai podcast where we help you achieve
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.120]   financial freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.520]   I'm your host, Sam Dogan.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.540]   With me today, I have the founder and CEO of Fundrise, Ben Miller.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.540]   Welcome to the show again, Ben.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.540]   Thanks for having me, Sam.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.160]   Hey, so it was great catching up with you in San Francisco over some steak dinners at
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.640]   Harris' Steakhouse.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.900]   I learned something about you during that dinner, and I learned that you don't eat rib
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.900]   eye.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.900]   No, is it rib eye?
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.900]   No, prime rib.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900]   Is that right?
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.760]   I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but I loved dinner.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   It was great.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.040]   It was fun to actually hang out.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.720]   I'm not a big fancy dinner person, honestly.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   That was funny because I was like, "Oh."
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.280]   Because I always get rib eye and prime rib confused.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.640]   Like rib eye, it's pretty marble-y.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640]   It's really good.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.980]   You said you cook your own rib eyes, but then the prime rib is like that slow roast cut,
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.320]   and you weren't quite familiar with it.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   I was like, "Oh, really?"
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   Because I've been a prime rib guy all my life, and I was like, "Oh, I love prime rib."
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.360]   I do cook a lot of steaks at home.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360]   I try to.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.480]   I have kids, and I feel like it's good for them to get some protein.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.560]   But yeah, I don't think I've been to a steak restaurant in so many years.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.960]   So I was like, "What's a prime rib?"
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.120]   You thought that was crazy.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.640]   Well, because I'm thinking like New York City, like the best prime ribs.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.260]   But you're in the D.C. area, and I think about Capitol Grill and Washington D.C. power lunches.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.160]   So that's why I was thinking like East Coast prime rib rib eye, that's like a staple.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   So that was an interesting surprise.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.120]   I try to avoid that scene as much as possible.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.940]   Right, right, right.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.200]   So in this episode, I really want to talk about interest rate cuts and what it means
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.620]   for the future of real estate.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.440]   Because we're at the cusp of the Fed cutting interest rates for the first time in four
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.840]   years in September.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.760]   And expectations are for up to 100 basis points in Fed rate cuts by the end of 2024.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.400]   And up to 200 basis points of cuts or 2% of Fed funds cuts by the end of 2025.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.320]   So to me, this sounds quite bullish.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.760]   But on the flip side, it also means that the Fed is seeing weakness in the labor market
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.080]   and in the economy, and it wants to ensure that the employment figures don't get too
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   bad.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.840]   So what are your thoughts, and how is Fundrise, and how are you thinking about investing in
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.280]   real estate going forward over the next 12 months to 24 months?
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.200]   Well, let's start with basics that interest rates are the biggest driver of real estate
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.160]   prices.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.840]   And so when interest rates went from zero to five and a quarter, five and a half percent,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.200]   that dampened real estate prices, depending on the asset class, by a decent amount.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.840]   At least in apartments, or self-storage, or industrial, prices probably came down 20 to
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.280]   30%.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.840]   So now, as you're saying, the rates are going to fall, and so expectations are the opposite,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.960]   is that as rates fall, it's cheaper to borrow, and real estate prices should rally.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.480]   And if they fall 2%, as you said, Fed Funds moves from five and a half, three and a half,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.440]   which I think is reasonable expectation over a year and a half or two years on a conservative
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.400]   basis, that's almost a 50% move.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.240]   And so it should spark a real estate bull rally.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.880]   And then the countervailing force, as you said, is will there be a recession, and how
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.840]   does that affect the broader market and real estate?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.680]   And so just the first point is that, yeah, falling interest rates should be very positive
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   for real estate.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.080]   I think the second point, which is, okay, how does a recession affect real estate and
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   how does it affect the broader economy?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.200]   I've been pretty consistent.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440]   I think there will be a recession.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.280]   I don't think that we'll avoid one.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.840]   I think it's a question of how severe it's going to be.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.480]   In a mild recession, I think that actually would probably be bad for stocks because the
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.680]   forward earnings forecasts are assuming close to what they call a no landing or no recession.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.680]   And I think that's unrealistic when we talk about how to reason that out.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.520]   And then how does it affect real estate?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.840]   And real estate is a big asset class, right?
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.760]   It's as big as a stock market, so you have to look at different parts of it.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.200]   And so some of real estate's pro cyclical, as in it goes with the cycle, some of it is
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   more counter cyclical.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   We mostly own apartments, rental apartments, and those are more counter cyclical.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.080]   Consumer staples like groceries and shelter end up doing pretty well in a recession comparatively.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.880]   And so I think that a recession, a mild recession with falling rates would be really good for
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.680]   fund rises real estate.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.520]   We would think we would outperform relative to most of the market if that's what happens.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.720]   Can you talk about a little bit more counter cyclical?
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.800]   So what does counter cyclical actually mean in real estate, what you're referring to?
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.520]   And also how would you rank the best performing commercial real estate asset classes in a
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.720]   declining interest rate environment?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.320]   What would the top three best performers be?
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   Well, so after the 2008 financial crisis, which I went through, a lot of people went
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.800]   back and looked at what happened, which asset classes did better and worse in 2008.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.120]   We can talk about how that would probably be different than the recession that may happen
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   in 2025.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   But what happened in 2008 was that there were a lot of foreclosures, there was a lot of
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.220]   unemployment, there was a lot of financial instability because a lot of banks went bankrupt.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.920]   And a lot of people moved from owning houses to renting apartments, and it was focused
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.480]   on affordability.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:09.000]   And so the reason why rental apartments do well is that when people can't afford to buy,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.440]   they rent.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.280]   And so that's why it ends up being counter cyclical because you end up with more renters
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.280]   and less homebuyers.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.460]   So you end up with more demand for rental product.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.200]   And that's what happened to an extreme extent in 2008 because the housing market collapsed.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   In this case, I don't think it's as extreme, but generally, yeah, when people are trying
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.880]   to pinch pennies and be more cost conscious, they usually end up renting over buying.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.280]   That makes sense.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.960]   And then so residential, what would the second subcommercial class be that would perform
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   quite well?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.340]   Because how do industrial, commercial properties or office perform in a declining interest
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.340]   rate environment?
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.000]   So like I said, the other extreme, notoriously office is the most pro cyclical.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.780]   So it does really well when the economy is hot and really poorly when the economy is
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:14.640]   cold because companies that previously were renting more space and expanding and hiring
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.440]   now start to contract and lay people off and are more conservative and reduce their space
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   demand.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.520]   So office, which in this case now is obviously already pretty bad, would actually do even
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   worse.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.720]   And so I think office, this is what I'm expecting with office for a while, is that you have
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.000]   two things happening in any point, any part of the economy, you have cyclical drivers
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and you have some permanent or secular drivers and office has a permanent decline in demand
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.640]   because of work from home, that decline is somewhere between 30% to 50% less demand than
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.680]   previous to pandemic.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.520]   And now you have a cyclical decline.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.040]   So office, I think it's just going to get really beat up even worse.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.200]   And I feel like that's still, I think one of the things you see consistently with financial
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.360]   investors is they really struggle with when norms break, they really don't know how to
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.280]   forecast when the past is not a good predictor of the future.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.800]   And I think that's true with office and that makes it an opportunity and a risk.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.760]   So I think office is the worst.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.440]   Industrial is somewhat more pro-cyclical because obviously companies lease spaces when
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.160]   there's stuff moving through the economy where industrial is essentially about the economic
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.480]   flows of goods.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.000]   And so industrial is not as resilient as apartments.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.880]   And so then in the middle, there's retail can be very pro-cyclical, but grocery, grocery
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   anchor chains.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.960]   And so you get into it and it starts getting nuanced and then also nuanced by region because
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.040]   a lot of times regions have very different impacts from recessions.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.960]   You could see Southern California could be, parts of Southern California are really driven
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.680]   by the aviation and defense industry and so you could see a lot of demand for defense
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.880]   driving that part, Orange County has been on tear.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.800]   So you really, with real estate location, location, location, so you need to look at
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.640]   these big macro drivers like interest rates, but then you got to get into the specific
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.920]   like Texas has been about oil and fracking and that's obviously not going to go away.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:32.160]   And so, yeah, but the most important point is that interest rates have a much bigger
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   impact on value than operating income.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.080]   So if you have apartment building that has 3% rent growth or 5% rent growth or 0% rent
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:49.200]   growth, that still won't have nearly the price impact as interest rates moving from a 5.5%
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   fed funds rate to a 3.5% fed funds rate.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:10:00.960]   That's a massive move and so even if incomes are hit by the recession, it's still not going
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.360]   to be as consequential as rates.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.640]   Got it.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:13.680]   So in that case, why wouldn't more funds or more firms invest a lot more in real estate
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.360]   in 2023 and 2024 when we know that rates are going to come down and things are going to
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.740]   turn around because eventually rates have to be cut because inflation is going to normalize
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:30.200]   back to 2%, 2.5% so you can't have the fed funds rate so far above that because that
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.480]   would be quite restrictive.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.840]   Can you remind us how much has Fundrise deployed in capital over the past 18 months and logically
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.440]   why wouldn't more funds invest more capital during depressed commercial real estate pricing
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.480]   when they know that rates are going to come down?
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.800]   I think a lot of people didn't know rates were going to come down and that there were
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.160]   very clear moments when people started arguing they wouldn't come down and you saw it happen
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.840]   twice in the last 18 months.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:07.880]   Happened in October 2023 when the treasury rates got it to 5% and Bill Ackman and a few
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.800]   other people were saying that treasuries might go to 6% or 7%.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.440]   Inflation was a norm.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.040]   I think that I never thought that was true but I definitely recognize that the market
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.040]   for...
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:27.600]   It happened again in Q1 where we had a re-acceleration inflation, Q1 of 2024 and in both cases treasuries
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.760]   went close to 5.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:35.080]   As you said, now treasuries have fallen to I think 3.8% and probably still falling, the
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   10-year treasury.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.520]   Yeah, there was no consensus that rates would come back down so funds were not deploying,
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.800]   that's one.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   Two, is there's kind of an idiosyncratic dynamic of how funds make decisions where you have
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   somebody who does the analysis, an analyst, they take it to the investing committee, investing
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.280]   committee signs off on it.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.720]   A funny attribute of investment committees is they really don't want to buy real estate
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.320]   where there's negative interest rate ARB, where the interest rate is higher than the
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.280]   purchase price.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:13.120]   Real estate is priced on yield and so you'd say, "Okay, I can buy a real estate deal at
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.040]   a 5.5% yield," and somebody says, "Yeah, but I can get a mortgage, the mortgage is going
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.080]   to cost 6% or 6.5%," and that's negative, it's literally the mortgage is more expensive
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.320]   than the yield, that's called negative carry.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.120]   And essentially the entire real estate industry investment committee almost entirely can't
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   get that through investment committee, it just looks really bad on paper.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.200]   Even though that's a static situation and we're about forecasting the future?
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:49.000]   Yeah, as I said, it's idiosyncratic and I like to tell the institutional establishment
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.840]   that like, "Look, in 2021, the exact opposite was the case, right?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.200]   Interest rates were close to zero and you were buying a yield of 3.5% and you had positive
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.800]   ARB, right, because the interest rates may have been 2.5% and you were buying 3.5%, it
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.220]   looks smart, but in retrospect, right, prices moved so much that you lost money."
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:16.120]   And that was everybody who was in the game saw that in 2021, nevertheless, when the opposite
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.480]   is true, but prices are low, but negative carry is high, you can't get it through investment
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   committee.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   It's just like very...
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.320]   Almost no investment committees will green light negative ARB, negative carry.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.760]   But that's like one of the reasons why funds didn't deploy.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.440]   And then lastly, the fund is not actually the source of the money, right?
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:42.360]   The fund is an agent of the LP, of the pension funds and the true capital sources in the
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.840]   market.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.040]   And most of these funds, they have to raise the next fund by liquidating the last fund
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.240]   and because what happens is the structure of the market, so there's structural reasons.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.480]   So if you are a fund, let's say you're KKR, Harbor Group, some big fund manager and you
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   have a...
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.880]   Let's say I'm just going to say round numbers, a billion dollar fund and you're fund five,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   you go back to your...
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.720]   And usually you have the same investors in every fund, there's probably not that much
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.200]   turnover, let's say 80% same investors every time.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.320]   And they've allocated 1% of their portfolio to KKR.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.100]   And so that 1% is already invested in funds one, two, three, four.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.840]   When you go to raise fund five, they need you to liquidate an earlier fund to fund the
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   next fund.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.160]   It's just like, there's kind of like a cycle.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.320]   And without liquidity, which is what's happening in venture capital too, it's happening across
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.480]   the whole private markets.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:45.420]   Without IPOs, without sales, without turning over capital, the LPs just don't have liquidity
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.480]   for the next fund and they don't want to increase their allocation today.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.360]   They actually may want to decrease their allocation because they can now put their money into
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.560]   bonds and credit at high rates.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:05.640]   So there's just a lot less money in the market in real estate and in venture than there was
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   before.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.960]   And that drives prices down and makes it a good time to buy.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   Got it.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.920]   Can you remind investors and listeners how much Fundrise deployed in capital?
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:22.280]   Because I know you guys also got a line of credit from one of the big banks to deploy
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   capital.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.080]   How was your thought process behind that and how much did you deploy over the past 12 to
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   18 months?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   It's more than a billion dollars.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.940]   The lesson I keep learning and I have to relearn it is that whenever the market goes left,
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.560]   you need to go right.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.880]   It's really the market reflexivity, as they call it, is that doing the opposite of what
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.560]   the market is doing is such a consistently good strategy.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.800]   And in 2021, we were conservative but not conservative enough.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.600]   The whole market was so bullish and I was not as bullish, but I should have been more
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   bearish.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.960]   And now the market is bearish and I've been more bullish.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   So to get good returns, you really have to move counter-cyclical or counter to the consensus.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:18.320]   And the consensus was to not deploy, and we deployed pretty aggressively across our strategies,
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.720]   which is built for rent and industrial.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.140]   And also we do a lending to, it's called pref lending to multifamily.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.800]   So yeah, I mean, a billion was good.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.840]   I wish we could have done 5 billion.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.960]   I think it's great in retrospect, but it's right now, there's been no material markups
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.600]   because it's still like, you can't really show the results of that until it's clear
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   in retrospect.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.920]   And I think it's not going to be clear for, as you said, end of next year, where I think
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.840]   we'll really see what you sort of presumed at the beginning, rates are going to fall
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.860]   a lot and the market is going to be in a different environment.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.820]   What is a 1 billion as a percentage of total investments, roughly speaking?
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.800]   It's a pretty decent percentage.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   It depends on the fund.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.540]   The flagship fund in the income fund, which are the newer funds are more aggressively
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.540]   deploying now.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.560]   So it's sort of a bigger percentage of those funds.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   Okay.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   How does it work in terms of getting the line of credit?
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   Do you basically pull the line of credit, pay the interest rate, invest in a property
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.520]   and then hope to make a better return than the cost of the credit?
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.880]   I mean, so as I said, we went left when the market went right.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:43.440]   And so about a year ago, we closed a $770 million line of credit with JP Morgan.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.640]   That line was designed to allow us to go buy, build for rent communities.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.760]   So those communities are typically 100 to 200 homes that we build and then rent, kind
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:00.160]   of like apartment buildings, horizontal apartment buildings.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.720]   And so, yeah, and the rate was negative.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.880]   The yield on the debt is higher than the yield on the acquisition price.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880]   Same with industrial.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.360]   We went out and bought a bunch of industrial buildings and typically when you're doing
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.000]   build for rent or you're doing a new industrial, it's vacant, right?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   It's leased up.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You had to lease it.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.360]   So there's a negative carry.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.800]   And we did that because you could get really good basis, like the price per square foot,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.020]   the price per unit, it was really low.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.960]   So we were one of the few, I mean, we must've been, there's a very short list of people
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.040]   who are out there active at that scale.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.920]   So I think it's going to pay dividends, but it's going to take a little bit of time to
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.960]   see if that was right, that basically prices do recover, rates come down and sort of the
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:58.560]   COVID inflation spike ends up being sort of like ancient history by end of next year.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.520]   You know, it's interesting you talked about the investment committee not getting these
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.040]   deals through the investment committee during a negative carry situation.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.920]   So once there is a neutral carry or positive carry, and this sounds to me like a lot of
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.840]   these deals will go through and then there's going to be a boom cycle again.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.120]   So no wonder why there's a boom bust cycle in real estate and other investments, because
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.280]   it seems like people don't invest until it's clear that there could potentially be a positive
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.920]   return and then it just goes crazy again.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   Yeah, there's these virtuous and vicious cycles.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.760]   And so let's paint a picture of what it would look like for it to start to boom again.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:47.240]   So today, Fed funds at five and a half, and typically you're borrowing from a lender at
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.840]   let's say 200 bps or 2% to 3% higher than that.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   So you're going to be borrowing five, six, seven, seven to eight and a half percent.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:03.600]   And somebody looks at that and gets sticker shock and nobody wants to pay 8% on a mortgage
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   until they don't buy anything.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:12.240]   Okay, so now let's say rates fall 200 basis points or 3.5% and you add 200 bps to that,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.520]   you're buying at 5.5% interest rate rather than a 7.5%.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:24.160]   And so all of a sudden, most of the market is pricing real estate at about 5.5% to 6%
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.560]   on the class A sort of high quality, industrial or multifamily.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:35.040]   And so the market doesn't clear, like nothing, transaction volumes fall in 80, maybe 90%.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.400]   So all of a sudden, there'll be a moment where either the interest rates will be par, is
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.960]   it neutral, or it'll be really clear, like imminent.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:52.000]   And then the entire market will probably clear overnight, clear, like transactions will just
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   skyrocket.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.280]   And then all of a sudden, fund three will, as I said, the earlier funds will get liquid,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.120]   they'll turn the money over and that money will then flow back into the market again.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.760]   So yeah, this is always the way the markets work, right?
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   They happen in these sort of like waves, just like we saw, I remember we went to short the
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.000]   market in February, 2020, because they were looking at pandemic and you're like, well,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   this is crazy.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.040]   But it's peaking February, 2020.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.440]   And then overnight, the market woke up to the pandemic.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.760]   So like, I think overnight, the market will wake up to low interest rates.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:35.200]   And once that's clear, we'll see a wave of transactions and then pricing will start to
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   move.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   I think there's a lull right now in the residential real estate market.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.360]   Because I think individuals, well, first it's summer time, depends on when this publishes,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.080]   we're going to be after summer, obviously.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.440]   But I think a lot of people are waiting for the Fed to finally cut for the first time
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.120]   to see the actual result.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.880]   And then I think a lot of individual home buyers are going to be like, okay, this is
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   go time.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.720]   We got a green light signal because once the Fed cuts, generally cuts multiple times over
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.360]   a long period of time, one or two years.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.080]   And so it does seem like the horses are in the stable right now, huffing and puffing
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.240]   and ready to go.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.300]   But people are just holding back, holding back.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:24.400]   So in this regard, what is the right strategy at the very beginning of the Fed funds interest
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.960]   rate cut cycle?
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.120]   You said you wanted to – you wish you invested five times more than you guys did.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.360]   But we're still at the beginning.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.440]   So does that mean there's still opportunity?
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.760]   I mean, there are some assets that are interest rate sensitive, right?
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:49.700]   So you saw, if you kind of look at the extreme, the long-dated 30-year mortgages that bankrupted
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:23:00.560]   Silicon Valley Bank, you saw treasuries fall 50% in value, the long-dated in October of
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.620]   2023, almost a year ago.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:11.000]   That's how much the duration on interest rates were just crushing value.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.760]   So interest rate sensitive assets are like how you play moving interest rates.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.960]   And so real estate is interest rate sensitive and so is debt, right?
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:29.440]   So it's like bonds and if you have a strong view on it, you want to get duration.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:35.160]   So real estate is obviously a long-dated duration and so are other kinds of bonds.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.320]   So that's typically how you'd play and then you'd have to get more tactical in terms of
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.720]   like where, what.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.920]   And so I'll tell you what we've been doing.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.000]   We try to boil things down to simplicity.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.040]   I feel like simplicity is underrated and so population growth is the biggest driver of
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.240]   real estate.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.800]   And so the population growth continues to be in only like four or five states.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:07.520]   And it's wild to me, those four or five states last year had millions of people added.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.640]   I mean, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, added potentially
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   like, I mean, depending on legal and illegal and migration, I mean, it could be three to
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.640]   five million people.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.320]   I mean, just astronomical.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.880]   That is, think about how many apartment units there has to be built.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   Think about it like this.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.640]   And that's one year, one, and it's probably next year, it'll be another million, 2 million.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.560]   So that is just such a driver of real estate.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.620]   It's not really priced into the market.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.620]   It's really opaque.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:44.400]   It's really hard for people to understand what's happening with immigration and migration.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.600]   But if you get to simplicity, you know that drives demand for real estate.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.360]   And so we've been focused on built for rent and apartments and industrial in those markets.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.320]   We bought a big industrial building in Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.720]   We bought one in Tampa, buying and building housing in Atlanta and Savannah.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.520]   So it's like, to make great returns, you want to hit as many sort of growth drivers as possible.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   One is interest rates.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   One is population.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.640]   You're going to get really micro in terms of which neighborhoods are going to get more
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.360]   growth versus others.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.160]   And so that's how we've been playing.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.660]   That's sort of our expertise.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:28.460]   I'm sure that people have other views in terms of the bond market.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:35.800]   We have been buying a lot of asset-backed securities actually too, or FASB, FASB securitizations,
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.280]   which is another way to play it, which is a little bit more obscure probably for most
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   people.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.880]   Well, tell me about demographic shifts, because one of the reasons why I started investing
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.020]   in private real estate and in Fundrise is because I live in San Francisco, I'm stuck
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:57.800]   in San Francisco or Honolulu, very expensive cost of living area, but I like it and I want
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:04.840]   to diversify my real estate assets into the Sunbelt, the Midwest, higher rental yields,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.220]   good demographic shift towards lower cost areas of the country, thanks to technology,
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:15.880]   work from home, all that good stuff, and illegal and legal migration trends.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:21.440]   But the one thing that I do worry about, which is what I did worry about before 2016 when
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:29.320]   I started investing, is the endless amount of capability to build the supply side of
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:35.040]   the equation, whereas in San Francisco, New York City, Seattle, Washington DC, it's very
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.960]   hard to build.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   So how does one look at on the one hand, the positive of the demographic growth, job market,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.880]   market valuations, and then the ability to build ever amount of new housing to meet that
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   demand?
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:59.320]   That was a concern for us and it really didn't play out, it didn't see oversupply until 2021.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:07.080]   So we've been investing in that Sunbelt for almost a decade and finally in 2021, when
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:13.960]   interest rates went to zero and there was all stimulus, you saw a spike in new supply
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:20.640]   of particular rental housing, and then particularly in the Sunbelt, and then in particular, in
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:28.960]   these sort of like super dense locations like the Gulch in Nashville, like Austin, Nashville,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.520]   it became really concentrated in certain markets where there was very little zoning constraints.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.640]   You could build high density and money was cheap.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.480]   And so we ended up, I think a lot of people who think about real estate think about zoning
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:51.000]   as the primary barrier like San Francisco versus Houston, but actually the cost of money
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.760]   was even more important and the cost of money got so cheap in 2021 that you saw this massive
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:07.000]   number of starts and those starts began delivering in 2024 and there was a concern that rental
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   rates would collapse.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.920]   And what surprised everybody in the housing business is that they didn't.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:23.160]   And so two things are what sort of tactically what happened in the near term, and then we
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   talk about the long term, tactically in the near term, what ended up happening is there
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:34.120]   was millions of immigration, illegal migration, whatever you want to call it, and that drove
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   more demand.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.040]   That was a surprise and it was mostly in these markets and drove housing demand.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:45.380]   And second is that rates were so high, to buy a house last year, mortgage rates were
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.040]   high sevens, 8%.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   So they rented.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.800]   It drove up rental demand.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:56.080]   And so we ended up absorbing that, absorbing that rental influx of new supply.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.160]   And that ended up being not as problematic with a couple exceptions.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   Let me just go with the longterm and we can come back to exceptions if you like.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:10.520]   The longterm, now if you try to build an apartment building, you're going to be paying 9% interest
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   rate probably.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.600]   And so starts or new construction has fallen off a cliff.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:22.400]   And so you look at the back half of 25, 26, and essentially supply is going close to zero.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.440]   I mean, it's fallen off the lowest maybe in decades.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:32.560]   And so we're likely to go into an environment where you have low supply, high population
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.520]   growth, high migration, low interest rates.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.120]   And so apartments are probably going to go into a really bullish environment in the back
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.080]   half 25.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:54.800]   And so I think apartments are likely to be a huge winner of this sort of like – coming
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.760]   out of this environment and so then see a huge price run.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.080]   Got it.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.160]   No, that makes sense.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:10.800]   Again, it sounds a lot again like boom bust, supply, low supply, no supply, boom.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:17.520]   Whereas demand seems to continuously rise relatively stable – in a stable fashion.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:23.360]   I'm curious to know your thoughts on the coastal city markets, especially since there's
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.800]   innovation fund, you're coming to San Francisco more, you're meeting a lot of these companies
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.040]   that are based in the Bay Area or maybe based in New York City.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.560]   Does your view of the coastal city markets change?
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.400]   Does it become a little bit more bullish based on what you're seeing out here?
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.560]   I mean, I've been bearish on coastal markets and it's why we shifted – I've been real
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:50.960]   estate for 20 some years and we were all coastal investing in like 2011, '12, '13.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.840]   That was where the growth was.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:59.280]   And we shifted away from New York, San Francisco, LA, DC around 2015, '16.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.680]   The reason we did is it got unaffordable.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.920]   The prices were just outrageous and I just thought that over time that would matter.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.640]   What's happened is that it's gotten more affordable relative to – or actually the
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:18.680]   Sunbelt has gotten more expensive and so the affordability gap has closed a lot.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.120]   It's still more affordable than Sunbelt by far, but it's not as big a gap.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.920]   I mean, just to give you a sense of – we were buying apartments in the Sunbelt for
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:34.960]   like $90,000 a unit in 2016 and now it's $200,000 a unit.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   Okay.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   That's a big move.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.560]   What does it cost to buy housing in San Francisco?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.600]   Apartments are probably $500,000 a unit.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:49.200]   So the relative affordability I think is less and I think that's important.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.160]   And there's still very little supply, which is keeping the rental market actually in some
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.400]   ways has been better in the blue cities.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.200]   But it's so challenging when you look at what's happened with office.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.560]   The collapse of office, there's been a lot of second order consequences and the biggest
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.400]   second order consequence in my opinion has been the collapse of downtown cities.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.560]   And so you just take – I mean, I'm going to do New York as an extreme.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.600]   With New York, there's a trillion dollars of real estate in New York City, right?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.440]   DC, 50 million square feet is probably – I mean, I don't know what the number is, but
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:32.360]   you're talking about that real estate has lost half its value and that means that the
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.400]   city's tax bases are gored, it means nobody's down there, it means a lot of foreclosures.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:46.060]   And so that negative cycle is going to hit cities, hit crime and it makes it really hard.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.200]   I think that my experience is that you can keep it simple.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.040]   You just want to be where the tailwinds are and where there's headwinds, maybe the price
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.600]   is worth it, but usually my experience is like it's so much easier to make money when
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.280]   there's a tailwind.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.200]   And so there's the headwinds in the blue cities and I just – that's – I think that makes
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   it tough.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.980]   It's not – I mean, you can do it, but you have to really be good at sailing into the
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:17.940]   wind and that's like a lot of tacking and skill and some luck because you could see
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.440]   an environment like – so let's do some black swans.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.200]   There's a recession and cities are hit harder and there's – this is what happened in '08,
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.280]   a lot of cities end up having like real maybe bankruptcy risks and things like that.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.520]   Chicago could go bankrupt.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.480]   Another one is Trump gets elected and he really passes policies that are bad for blue cities.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.200]   That could really be problematic.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.880]   So – and I think technology and work from home is not going to slow, I think it's going
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   to accelerate.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:57.560]   I think people are underestimating the technological impact of virtual reality, AI, driverless
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:04.120]   cars that I think will make working remotely even more attractive over time, over a decade,
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   which I think is a headwind for downtown cities, blue cities.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:15.560]   So all things being equal, it just doesn't seem like the uncertainty is worth it on a
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.480]   sort of global basis.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   Interesting.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.440]   The way I look at it is two ways.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.560]   One is you can move your money to the Sunbelt, Midwest, cheaper areas of the country to invest
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.160]   for higher yields, more passive income.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:36.440]   The second way is if you live in a coastal city, a blue city, San Francisco for example,
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.460]   you just live in a place and take advantage of the region in the city that's farther
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.760]   away from downtown that's cheaper.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.080]   So you invest for example on the west side of San Francisco, which is near the oceans,
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.040]   a lot more parks, a lot more space.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.760]   It's less expensive and then you just buy up as much real estate there and it is downtown
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.320]   which is on the east side.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   Will it recover?
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:03.040]   It is recovering, maybe slower than expected and then you just kind of wait it out and
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   see what's there.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:10.360]   So there's like a micro geographic arb and a bigger picture, bigger country geographic
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.760]   arb which is being held by platforms like Fundrise which invest in those areas.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.080]   Yeah, it's the same principle.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:26.800]   It's just like I work from the top down to say, "Okay, we're in the nation, we're in
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.080]   the region, we're in the state, we're in the city."
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:36.120]   And you just want to look for that arb, that growth arb where it's less expensive with
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.720]   more growth and then affordability is like gravity.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.040]   People flow to where it's affordable and nice.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:54.360]   An interesting question is how much is policy, national policy, the election, how does that
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.720]   affect real estate?
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:04.040]   Because you have two policy platforms that are both actually fairly populist and just
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:12.280]   like Kamala Harris has $25,000 down payment assistance policy plus actually credits for
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.840]   builders who build entry level homes.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:22.600]   There's worlds where that kind of policy could end up stimulating a ton of housing demand
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.640]   and housing supply and so that could be really consequential.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:37.040]   And then Trump's policy, at least his platform is high tariffs, 10 to 60% tariffs on imports
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.160]   and so that could be really consequential to real estate as well.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:52.840]   So there are definite uncertainties around the policy landscape that could really matter.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   It really does seem like there are two things, Fed funds and straight cuts and the election.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.960]   Those two things, everybody is just waiting because people are thinking, "Well, we're
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   almost there.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.000]   Might as well just wait to see what happens and then whatever happens, then we can plan
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.840]   accordingly."
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.880]   And I think for the presidential side, it's interesting because I don't think the president
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.960]   really moves the needle too much from our day-to-day lives or how we invest and it depends
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.160]   on checks and balances with what happens with Congress.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:33.040]   But from Harris' point of view, if you provide a $25,000 credit for first time home buyers,
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.400]   the economist in me says, "Well, that means first time homes are going to increase in
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.940]   price by $25,000 immediately."
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.720]   Of course it's going to be gradual but I think the logic is, "Well, you have $25,000 more
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   to spend on a home.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.980]   I'm going to raise my price by $25,000 or at least by something because we know you
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.160]   have more money in your pocket."
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.480]   I went and read the policy and there's not enough detail to really be able to unpack
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.280]   it and have a good forecast.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.360]   I think there's, as you said, there's like I think two or three possibilities and they're
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   not mutually exclusive.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.680]   I think it increases prices.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.600]   Draws in demand, could increase prices more.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:20.920]   But it could also like you're seeing actually today is there's no supply of existing homes
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:25.880]   and one of the reasons prices haven't fallen for single family homes is that there's no
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   supply and prices set by supply and demand and so high interest rates lower prices for
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:39.640]   institutional real estate because real estate in institutional world is priced by yield
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.520]   but that's not how home prices are priced.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:50.320]   And so there's a world where interest rates fall and that drives up supply a lot and then
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.720]   you could see prices fall actually.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:01.440]   So, if you could bring more demand to market actually there could be kind of really dynamics
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.840]   there that are more complicated.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.760]   And then the second is that we're fairly active in the home building business.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:13.800]   We lend to home builders, we build homes, we have 10,000 lots that we own that we supply
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.080]   to the housing industry like the big home builders.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:23.240]   And so I was sitting with our team trying to game out like kind of a scenario that would
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:28.320]   surprise people and they just give this scenario to you because I thought it was interesting.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:36.480]   So, I know that a home builder if they wanted to could build a entry-level home for $200,000
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.600]   which they don't today because it's not profitable and the market is not there.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:50.480]   And so, but they could supply $200,000 homes to market and with a $25,000 tax credit to
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.560]   home buyers for first-time home buyers.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.920]   And then I think there's inner plan tax credits for home builders for first-time or for entry-level
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920]   homes.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.120]   There's a world where you could see $25,000 to the home builder and $25,000 to the home
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.520]   buyer on a $200,000 home.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.920]   And so you could see like, I mean, that would be a 50% profit margin to the home builder.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.240]   And so you could see a world and this is not, I mean, this is not necessarily what I'm forecasting.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:25.640]   You could see a world where there's just like a huge incentive to build that product.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.480]   And then, I mean, they would build it if there was demand for it.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.520]   And I think what ends up being the limiting factor is actually they would need to be building
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:39.240]   it in the exurbs.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:44.000]   So it depends on where you are, but it's probably like 45 minutes to an hour away from the city.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.240]   And so do people want to live 45 minutes to an hour, hour and 15 minutes from the city?
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.120]   No, unless there's a technological breakthrough.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.320]   So there are some constellation of events where Facebook introduced the virtual reality
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   or something.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   It's a thing.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   This is not what...
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.080]   The reason why it's interesting to think about this is that these sort of surprises is how
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.960]   you make a lot of money and you own 10,000 lots and all of a sudden they're twice as
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.760]   valuable because of these sort of like two or three things.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   This is what happened with AI.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.920]   This is what happened with pandemic.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.680]   These shocks have these huge, I mean, look at Nvidia, right?
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.740]   Huge consequences to value.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:28.160]   And so it's not because I think it's likely, but because I think it's asymmetrical and
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   it's impact.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   Got it.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.840]   No, that makes sense.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.400]   Well, Bet, it's been great chatting with you.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:41.160]   It sounds to me like there are a lot of tailwinds and the main tailwind is fed funds cuts and
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.460]   mortgage rate declines over the next one to two years.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.760]   So I think I'm bullish.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   No, I know I'm bullish.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:55.120]   And if I had $5 and I had to split it between investing in stocks or real estate, I would
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.440]   invest $3.5 in real estate versus $1.5 in stocks right now.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.520]   How would you split that $5?
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.840]   I'm very worried the stock market is overpriced.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:12.880]   So I would do real estate and bonds and venture.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.140]   I just think the stock market at the moment is pricing no recession.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:22.280]   And I think that chance of a no recession is low, but I'm not in the consensus today.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.280]   Okay, that's good.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.360]   So $0 out of five in the stock market.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.960]   So out of the $5, how much of that in real estate versus bonds?
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:37.160]   I mean, I'm splitting it across venture, fixed income or credit, and real estate, I don't
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.960]   know, third or third or third or something like that.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.640]   They're all tailwinded today.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:49.880]   And so I'm not saying that any one is that much better than the other.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.840]   I think the stock market potentially has...
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.040]   If there's a recession because interest rates are coming down, that's the thing, typically
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.400]   interest rates come down before the stock market collapses.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.360]   And the reason those interest rates come down is because there's a recession and the equity
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:11.560]   market is pricing no recession and the credit market is pricing a recession.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.440]   So they have two different markets with two different opinions and the credit market is
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.880]   actually the much bigger and usually the more predictive market.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.280]   But the credit market has been wrong for the past 18 months.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.280]   Totally.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   Right.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.160]   So again, this is my view and it's possible that the equity market is right, but there's
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:36.800]   just like – I think the downside in the stock market is much more than the upside
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   today.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   I agree with that.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.520]   Well, in terms of where I'd allocate my capital between real estate and stocks, yeah, okay.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.040]   Maybe it's $4 to real estate, $1 to the stock market.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   I can see that.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.280]   All right, Ben, well, it's great chatting with you.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.680]   Let's catch up again maybe after all the cuts start and see what happens.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   Okay.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   All right.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   Excellent.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   Thanks, Sam.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   Thanks.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   I hope you enjoyed my interview with Ben Miller, co-founder and CEO of Fundrise.

[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   real estate.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:25.280]   I believe in the long-term demographic trend of people moving out of expensive cities to
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.480]   lower-cost areas of the country thanks to technology and the internet.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.560]   Also, I believe in private growth companies and particularly in artificial intelligence.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.040]   It is the technology of our lifetimes and I want to gain exposure.
