[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   So people need to go back and read the history of the first hundred days under
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   FDR, the sheer amount of legislation that went through his ability to bring
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.040]   Congress to heel and the Senate.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040]   He gets all this stuff through, but as you and I know, legislation takes a
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.360]   long time to put into place, right?
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.600]   We've had people starving on the streets all throughout 1933 under Hoover.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.280]   The difference was Hoover was seen as this do nothing joke who would
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.240]   dine nine course meals in the white house.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.600]   And he was a filthy rich banker.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220]   FDR comes in there and every single day has him fireside chats.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360]   He's passing legislation, but more importantly, so he, he tries various
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.760]   different programs, then they get ruled unconstitutional.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.680]   He tries even more.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.280]   So what does America take away from that?
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.120]   Every single time, if he gets knocked down, he comes back fighting.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.800]   And that was a really part of his character that he developed, uh, after
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.640]   he got polio and it was, uh, it gave him the strength to persevere through.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   Personally, what he could transfer in his calm demeanor and his feeling of
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.380]   fight that America really got that spirit from him and was able to climb
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.340]   itself out of the great depression.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.620]   He's such an inspirational figure.
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.860]   I think of Johnson and of Nixon, of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR, I can
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.820]   give you a laundry list of personal problems that all those people had.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.980]   I think they had a really, really good judgment.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.440]   And, uh, I'm not sure how intrinsic their own personal character was to their
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.140]   exploration and thinking about the world.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.120]   So JFK is actually JFK might be our best example because he had the best
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.560]   judgment out of anybody in the room as a brand new president in the Cuban
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.020]   missile crisis, and he got us out and avoided nuclear war, which he
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.580]   deserves eternal credit for that.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.880]   And I encourage people out there.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.640]   This is a, this is a brutal text.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520]   We were forced to read it in graduate school.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.120]   Uh, the essence of decision by Graham Allison.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.480]   I'm so thankful we did.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.160]   It's one of the foundations of political science because it lays out
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.640]   theories of how government works.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.440]   People really need to understand Washington.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.640]   Washington is a creature with traditions, with institutions
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.400]   that don't care about you.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.160]   They don't even really care about the president.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   They have self-perpetuating mechanisms, which have been done a certain way.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.360]   And it usually takes a great shocking event like world war two to change
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.600]   really anything beyond the marginal.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.200]   Every once in a while, you have a figure like Teddy Roosevelt, who's
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.040]   actually able to take peacetime presidency and transform the country,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.920]   but it needs an extraordinary individual to get something like that done.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.160]   Uh, so the question around the essence of decision was the theory
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.600]   behind the Cuban missile crisis of how Kennedy arrived at, at his decision.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   And, uh, there are various different schools of thought, but one of the
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   things I love about the book is it presents a case for all three, the
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.800]   organizational theory, the bureaucratic politics theory, and then kind of
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.560]   the great man theory as well.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.240]   So there's a, you know, you and I could sit here and I could tell you a
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.280]   case about PT 109 and about how John F.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.160]   Kennedy experienced world war two and how he literally swam miles with a
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.120]   wounded man's life jacket strap in his teeth with a broken back, and he saved
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.760]   him and he ended up on the cover of life magazine and he was a war hero.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.840]   And he was a deeply smart individual who wrote a book in 1939 called why
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.400]   England slept, which to this day is considered a, a, a text, which at the
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.200]   moment was able to describe in detail why Neville Chamberlain and the British
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.480]   political system arrived at the policy of appeasement.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.280]   I actually have a original copy.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.960]   It's one of my most prized possessions because from 1939, because this is a 23
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.440]   year old kid.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.160]   Who the fuck are you?
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.520]   John F.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.920]   Kennedy.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.720]   Um, turns out he's a brilliant man.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.320]   And.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.120]   Another just favorite aside is that at the Potsdam conference, you know, where
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.880]   Harry Truman is there with Stalin and everybody.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   So in the room at the same time, Harry S.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.240]   Truman, president of the United States, Dwight D.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.080]   Eisenhower, the general, right.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.960]   Who will succeed him 26 year old John F.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.680]   Kennedy as a journalist.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.640]   And all three of those presidents were in the same room with
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   Joseph Stalin and others.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.240]   And that that's the story of America right there.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.080]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.760]   I'm going to give you one of the most depressing quotes, which is deeply
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.160]   true.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.720]   Roger Ailes, who is a genius shout out to the loudest voice in the room by
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.520]   Gabriel Sherman.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.680]   That book changed my life too.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.960]   Um, because it really made me understand the media.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.640]   People don't want to be informed.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.800]   They want to feel informed.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.680]   The following is a conversation with Sagar and Jetty his second time in the
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.360]   podcast.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.840]   Sagar is a political commentator, journalist, co-host of breaking points
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.640]   with crystal ball and of the realignment podcast with Marshall Kozlov.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.160]   Sagar is one of the most well-read people I've ever met.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.400]   His love of history and the wisdom gained from reading thousands of history
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.800]   books radiates through every analysis he makes of the world.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.400]   And this podcast, we trace out the history of the various ideological
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.240]   movements that led up to the current political moment.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.280]   In doing so, we mentioned a large number of amazing books.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.080]   We'll put a link to them in the description for those interested to
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.560]   learn more about each topic.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.680]   This is Alex Friedman podcast to support it.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.760]   Please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   And now dear friends here, Sagar and Jetty.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   So let's start with the obvious big question.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.800]   Why do you think Trump won?
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.000]   Let's break it down.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.920]   Before the election, you said that if Trump wins, it's going
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.560]   to be because of immigration.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.920]   So aside from immigration, what are the maybe less than
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   obvious reasons that Trump won?
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.360]   Yes, we absolutely need to return to immigration, but without that
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.200]   multifaceted explanation, let's start with the easiest one.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.440]   Um, there has been a wave of anti incumbent energy around the world.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.160]   Financial times chart recently went viral showing.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.800]   So the first time I think since world war two, possibly since 1905, I need
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.600]   to look at the data set that all anti incumbent parties all across
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.040]   the world suffered major defeats.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.640]   So that's a very, very high level analysis.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.520]   And we can return to that.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.720]   If we talk about Donald Trump's victory in 2016, cause there was
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.160]   similar like global precursors that individual level in the United States.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.520]   There's a very simple explanation as well, which is that Joe Biden was very old.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.600]   He was very unpopular.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.880]   Inflation was high.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.240]   Inflation is one of the highest determiners of people switching their
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.840]   votes and putting their primacy on that ahead of any other
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.040]   issue at the ballot box.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.760]   So that's that, but I think it's actually much deeper at a psychological
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.680]   level for who America is and what it is.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.960]   And fundamentally, I think what we're going to spend a lot of time
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.520]   talking about today is, uh, the evolution of the modern left and its
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.120]   collapse, uh, in the Kamala Harris candidacy and eventually the loss to
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.680]   Donald Trump in the popular vote, where really is like an apotheosis
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.960]   of several social forces.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.560]   So we're going to talk about the great awakening or so-called
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.880]   awokening, which is very important to understanding all of this.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   There's also really Donald Trump himself, who was really one of the
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.040]   most unique individual American politicians that we've seen in decades.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.640]   Uh, at this point, Donald Trump's victory makes him the most important
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.880]   and transformative figure in American politics since FDR.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.640]   And a thought process for the audience is in 2028, there will be an 18 year
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.160]   old who's eligible to vote, who cannot remember a time when Donald J.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.120]   Trump was not the central American figure.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.920]   And there's stories, uh, in world war two, where troops were on the
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.240]   front lines, some of their 18, 19 years old FDR died, and they literally
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.640]   said, well, who's the president?
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.400]   And they said, Harry Truman, you dumb ass.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.240]   And they go, who?
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.400]   They couldn't conceive of a universe where FDR was not the
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.040]   president of the United States.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   And, you know, Donald Trump, even during the Biden administration, he was the
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.680]   figure Joe Biden defined his entire candidacy and his legacy around defeating
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.400]   this man, obviously he's failed.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.560]   We should talk a lot about Joe Biden as well for his own
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.720]   failed theories of the presidency.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   So.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.280]   I think at a macro level, it's easy to understand at a basic level
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.600]   inflation, it's easy to understand.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.480]   But what I really hope that a lot of people can take away is how fundamentally
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.760]   unique Donald Trump is as a political figure and what he was able to do to
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.840]   realign American politics really forever.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.320]   I mean, in the white working class realignment originally of 2016, the
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   activation really of a multiracial kind of working class coalition and of really
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.360]   splitting American lines along a single individual question of did you attend a
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.040]   four-year college degree institution or not?
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.360]   And this is a crazy thing to say.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.920]   Donald Trump is one of the most racially depolarizing
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.840]   electoral figures in American history.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.280]   We lived in 2016 at a time when racial groups, you know, really voted in
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.560]   blocks, Latinos, blacks, whites.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.120]   There was some, of course, division between the white working class and the
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.800]   white college educated, white collar workers.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.160]   But by and large, you could pretty fairly say that Asians, Indians, everyone,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.720]   80, 90 percent were going to vote for the Democratic Party, Latinos as well.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.400]   I'm born here in Texas, in the state of Texas.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.520]   George W. Bush shocked people when he won some 40 percent of the Latino vote.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.600]   Donald Trump just beat Kamala Harris with Latino men and he ran
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.120]   up the table for young men.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.200]   So really, fundamentally, we have witnessed a full realignment in American
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.560]   politics, and that's a really fundamental problem for the modern left.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.200]   It's erased a lot of the conversation around gerrymandering, around the
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.240]   electoral college, the so-called electoral college bias towards Republicans.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.560]   Really, the being able to win the popular vote for the first time since
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.080]   2004 is shocking and landmark achievement by a Republican.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   In 2008, I have a book on my shelf and I always look at it to remind
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.520]   myself of how much things can change.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.120]   James Carville, and it says 40 more years, how Democrats will
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.400]   never lose an election again.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.720]   2008, they wrote that book after the Obama coalition and the landslide.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.280]   And something I love so much about this country, people change
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.600]   their minds all the time.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.960]   I was born in 1992.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.480]   I watched red states go blue.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.880]   I've seen blue states go red.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   I've seen swing states go red or blue.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.400]   I've seen millions of people pick up and move.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.720]   The greatest internal migration in the United States since World War II.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.760]   And it's really inspiring because it's a really dynamic, interesting
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.080]   place, and I love covering it.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.760]   I love thinking about it, talking about it, talking to people.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.360]   It's awesome.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.440]   One of the reasons I'm a big fan of yours is you're a student of history.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.560]   And so you recommended a bunch of books to me and they and others
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.200]   thread the different movements throughout American history.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.120]   Some movements take off and do hold power for a long time.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.720]   Some don't.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.840]   And some are started by a small number of people and are controlled
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.960]   by a small number of people.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.120]   Some are mass movements.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.360]   And it's just fascinating to watch how those movements evolve and
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.520]   then fit themselves maybe into the constraints of a two-party system.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.960]   And I'd love to sort of talk about the various perspectives of that.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.960]   Um, so would it be fair to say that this election was turned
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.200]   into a kind of class struggle?
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.400]   Well, I won't go that far, um, because to say it's a class struggle
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.960]   really implies that things fundamentally align on economic lines.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.080]   And, uh, I don't think that's necessarily accurate.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.000]   Although if, if that's your lane lens, you could get there.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.720]   So there's a, a very big statistic going around right now where Kamala
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.800]   Harris increased her vote share and won households over $100,000 or more.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   Uh, and Donald Trump won households under 100,000.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.760]   So you could view that in an economic lens.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.600]   The problem again, that I have is that that is much more a proxy for four
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.240]   year college degree and for education.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.000]   And so one of my favorite books is called Coming Apart by Charles Murray.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.120]   Uh, and that book really, really underscores how the cultural
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.320]   milieu that people swim in, uh, when they attend a four year college
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.800]   degree and the trajectory of their life, not only on where they move to,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.520]   who they marry, what type of grocery store they go to, their cultural,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.480]   uh, what television shows that they watch.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.920]   One of my favorite questions from Charles Murray is called a bubble quiz.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.240]   I encourage people to go take it by the way.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.040]   Uh, which asks you a question.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.360]   It's like, what does the word Branson mean to you?
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.800]   And it has a couple of answers.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.000]   One of them is, uh, Branson is Richard Branson, Sir Richard Branson.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.080]   Number two is Branson, Missouri, which is like a country music
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.360]   tourist style destination.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.840]   And three is it means nothing.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.720]   So you are less than a bubble.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.240]   If you say country music and you're very much in the bubble,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   if you say Richard Branson.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.640]   And, uh, I remember taking that test for the first time.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.040]   I go, obviously Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic, like what?
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.440]   And then I was like, wait, I'm like, I'm in the bubble.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   And, uh, there are other things in there.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.400]   Like, can you name various different military ranks?
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.840]   I can, cause I'm a history nerd, but the vast majority of
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   college educated people don't know anybody who served in
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.800]   the United States military.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.880]   They don't have family members who do, uh, the most popular
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.840]   shows in America are like the big bang theory and NCIS.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.000]   Uh, whereas people in our probably cultural milieu, uh, our
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   favorite shows are white Lotus, the last of us is prestige
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.840]   television, right?
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.520]   With a very small audience, but high income, high education.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.600]   So the point is, is that culture really defines who we are as
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.240]   Americans, where we live and, uh, rural urban is one way to
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.360]   describe it, but honestly, with the work from home revolution
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.080]   and more rich people and highly educated people moving to more
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.880]   rural suburban or areas that traditionally weren't able to
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.360]   commute in that's changing.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.720]   And so really, um, the internet is everything, the stuff that
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.960]   you consume on the internet, the stuff that you spend your time
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.120]   doing type of books, you read, whether you read a book at all,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.960]   frankly, uh, whether you travel to Europe, whether you have a
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.680]   passport, um, you know, all the things that you value in your
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.600]   life, that is the real cultural divide in America.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.000]   And I actually think that's what this revolution of, uh, Donald
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.440]   Trump was activating and bringing people to the polls,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.560]   bringing a lot of those traditional working class voters
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.440]   of all races away from the democratic party, along the
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.400]   lines of elitism of sneering and of a general cultural feeling
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.280]   that these people don't understand me and my struggles
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:43.800]   in this life.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.000]   And so the trivial formulation is that it's the wokeism, the
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.240]   anti-wokeism movement.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.600]   So it's not necessarily that, uh, Trump winning was a
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.320]   statement against wokeism.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.600]   It was the broader anti-elitism.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.160]   It's difficult to say because, uh, I wouldn't dismiss
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   anti-wokeism or wokeism as an explanation.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.880]   Um, but we need to understand like the electoral impacts
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.320]   of woke.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.680]   So there's varying degrees of like how you're going to
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.920]   encounter quote unquote wokeism.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.320]   And this is a very difficult thing to define.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.960]   So let me just try and break it down, which is there are
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.440]   the types of things that you're going to interact with on
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.600]   a cultural basis.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.400]   And what I mean by that is going to watch a TV show.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.440]   And just for some reason, there's like two trans
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.840]   characters and it's never like particularly explained why
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.560]   they just are there or watching a commercial.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.000]   And it's the same thing, uh, watching, I don't know.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.680]   I remember it was watching, I think it was Dr.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.400]   Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.680]   And the main, it was a terrible movie, by the way.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.320]   Don't recommend it.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.560]   Uh, but one of the characters, I think it's her name was
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.760]   like America and she wore a gay pride flag, right?
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.200]   Look, many left-wingers would make fun of me for saying
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.920]   these things, but that is obviously a social agenda to
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.800]   the point as in, they believe it is like deeply acceptable
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.920]   that is used by Hollywood and cultural elites who really
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   value those progress, you know, in sexual orientation and
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   others, and they really believe it's important to "showcase"
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.200]   it for representation.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.960]   So that's like one way that we may encounter "wokeism."
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.120]   But the more important ways, frankly, are the ways that
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.040]   affirmative action, which really has its roots in, you
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.320]   know, American society all the way going back to the 1960s
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.720]   and how those have manifested in our economy and in our
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.080]   understanding of "discrimination."
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.400]   So two books I can recommend.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   One is called The Origins of Woke.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.680]   That's by Richard Hanania.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.360]   There's another one, The Age of Entitlement, by
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   Christopher Caldwell.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.560]   And they make a very strong case that Caldwell, in
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.920]   particular, that he calls it like a "new founding of
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.680]   America" was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.040]   because it created an entire new legal regime and
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.880]   understanding of race in the American character and how
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.040]   the government was going to enforce that.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.720]   And that really ties in with another one of the books
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.400]   that I recommended to you about The Origins of Trump by
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.320]   Jim Webb, and Senator Jim Webb, incredible, incredible
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.080]   man. He's so underappreciated, intellectual, he was
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.520]   anti-war, and he was—people may remember him from the
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.520]   2016 primary, and they asked him a question, I don't
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.480]   exactly remember, about one of his enemies.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.680]   And he's like, "Well, one of them was a guy shot in
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.120]   Vietnam." And he was running against Hillary.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.560]   And that guy, he wrote the book Born Fighting, I think
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.640]   it's what's history of the Scots-Irish people, something
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.880]   like that. And that book really opened my eyes to the
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.920]   way that affirmative action and racial preferences
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.320]   that were playing out, you know, through the HR
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.960]   managerial elite really turned a lot of people within
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.080]   the white working class away from the Democratic Party
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.720]   and felt fundamentally discriminated against by the
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.360]   professional managerial class.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.760]   And so there's a lot of roots to this, the managerial
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.560]   revolution by James Burnham, and in terms of the
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.520]   origin of kind of how we got here, but the
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   crystallization of, like, DEI and/or affirmative
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.920]   action—I prefer to use the term "affirmative
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.200]   action"—in the highest echelons of business, and
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   there became this idea that representation itself
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.120]   was the only thing that mattered. And I think that
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.160]   right around 2014, that really went on steroids, and
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.520]   that's why it's not an accident that Donald J.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.280]   Trump elected in 2016.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.240]   At this point, do you think this election is a kind
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.760]   of statement that wokeism as a movement is dead?
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.480]   I don't know. I mean, it's very difficult to say
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.080]   because wokeism itself is not a movement with a
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.520]   party leader. It's a amorphous belief that has
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.400]   worked its way through institutions now for almost
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.760]   40 or 50 years. I mean, it's effectively a
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.560]   religion. And part of the reason why it's difficult
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.240]   to define is it means different things to
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.280]   different people. So, for example, there are
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.920]   varying degrees of how we would define, quote
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.960]   unquote, "woke." Do I think that the Democrats will
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.880]   be speaking in so-called academic language? Yes, I
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.440]   do think they will. I think that the next
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.920]   Democratic nominee will not do that. However,
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.880]   Kamala Harris actually did move as much as she
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.160]   could away from, quote unquote, "woke," but she
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.240]   basically was punished for a lot of the sins of
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.600]   both herself from 2019, but a general cultural
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.240]   feeling that her and the people around her do not
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.520]   understand me and not only do not understand me,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.400]   but have racial preferences or a regime or an
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.680]   understanding that would lead to a, quote unquote,
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.040]   "equity mindset," you know, equal outcomes for
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.600]   everybody as opposed to equality of opportunity,
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.720]   which is more of a colorblind philosophy. So I
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.600]   can't say. I think it's way too early. And, you
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.520]   know, again, like, you can not use the word
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.200]   "Latinx," but do you still believe in an
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.720]   effective affirmative action regime, you know, in
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.880]   terms of how you would run your Department of
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.920]   Justice, in terms of how you view the world, in
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   terms of what you think the real dividing lines
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.160]   in America are? Because I would say that's still
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.000]   actually kind of a woke mindset. And that's part
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.240]   of the reason why the term itself doesn't really
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.160]   mean a whole lot. And we have to get actually
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.880]   really specific about what it looks like in
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.280]   operations. In operation, it means affirmative
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.320]   action. It means the NASDAQ passing some law
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.480]   that if you want to go public or something, that
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.600]   you have to have a woman and a person of color on
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.400]   your board. Like, this is a blatant and
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.240]   extraordinary, like, racialism that they've
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.360]   enshrined in their bylaws. So you can get rid of
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.920]   ESG. That's great. But, you know, you can get rid
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.960]   of DEI. I think that's great. But it's really
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.320]   about a mindset and a view of the world. And I
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.280]   don't think that's going anywhere.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.560]   And you think the reason it doesn't work well in
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.160]   practice is because there's a big degree to which
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.920]   it's anti-meritocracy.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.680]   It's anti-American, really. I mean, you know, DEI
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.880]   and woke and affirmative action make perfect
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.240]   sense in a lot of different countries, OK? And
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.480]   there are a lot of countries out there that are
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   multi-ethnic and they're heterogeneous and they
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.200]   were run by basically quasi-dictators. And the
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.680]   way it works is that you pay off the Christians
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.000]   and you pay off the Muslims and they get this
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.800]   guy and they get that guy. And everybody kind of
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.360]   shakes it. It's very explicit. They're like, we
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.040]   have 10 spots and they go to the Christians. We
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.080]   have 10 spots and it goes to the Hindus. I'm
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   talking India is a country I know pretty well.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.000]   And this does kind of work like that on state
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.720]   politics level in some respect. But in America,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   you know, fundamentally, we really believe that
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.640]   no matter where you are from, that you come here
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.960]   and basically within a generation, especially if
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.600]   you migrate here legally and you integrate, that
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.120]   you leave a lot of that stuff behind. And the
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.600]   story, the American dream that is ingrained in so
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.880]   many of us is one that really does not mesh well
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.600]   with any sort of racial preference regime or
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.280]   anything that's not meritocratic. And I mean, I
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   will give the left wingers some credit in the
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.080]   idea that meritocracy itself, you know, could
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   have preference for people who have privileged
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.760]   backgrounds. I think that's true. And so, you
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.520]   know, the way I would like to see it is to
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.240]   increase everybody's equality of opportunity to
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.760]   make sure that they all have a chance at, quote
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.680]   unquote, willing out the American dream. But that
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.160]   doesn't erase meritocracy, hard work, and many of
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.960]   the other things that we associate with the
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.200]   American character, with the American frontier.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.320]   So really, these are two ideologies which are
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.640]   really at odds, like in a lot of ways, like
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.560]   wokeism, racialism, and all this is a third
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.960]   world ideology. It's one that's very prevalent in
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.800]   Europe and all across Asia, but it doesn't mix
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.600]   well here. And it shouldn't. And I'm really glad
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.320]   that America feels the same way.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.600]   Yeah, I got to go back to Jim Webb and that
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.720]   book. What a badass, fascinating book.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.200]   Oh my God.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.040]   "Born Fighting," how the Scots-Irish shaped
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.600]   America. So I did not realize to the degree,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.120]   first of all, how badass the Scots-Irish are, and
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.560]   to the degree, many of the things that kind of
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.640]   identify as American and part of the American
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.520]   spirit were defined by this relatively small
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.320]   group of people. As he describes, the motto
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.160]   could be summarized as "fight, sing, drink, and
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.840]   pray." So there's the principles of fierce
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.520]   individualism, the principles of a deep
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.240]   distrust of government, the elites, the
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.760]   authorities, bottom-up governance, over 2,000
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.440]   years of a military tradition. They made up 40%
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.120]   of the Revolutionary War Army and produced
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.080]   numerous military leaders, including Stonewall
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.840]   Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, George S. Patton, and
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   a bunch of presidents, some of the more
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.800]   gangster presidents, Andrew Jackson, Teddy
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.960]   Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan, Bill
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.320]   Clinton. Just the whole cultural legacy of
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.280]   country music.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.000]   We owe them so much, and they really don't get
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.280]   their due, unfortunately. A lot of, for the
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.560]   reasons that I just described around racialism
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.160]   is because post-mass immigration from Europe,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.720]   the term "white" kind of became blanket applied
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.480]   to new Irish, to Italians, to Slovenians, and
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.840]   as you and I both know, if you travel those
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.680]   countries, people are pretty different, and
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.360]   it's not that different here in the United
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.240]   States. Scott Cyrus was some of the original
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   settlers here in America, and particularly in
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.640]   Appalachia, and their contribution to the
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.920]   fighting spirit and their own culture, and who
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.520]   we are as individualists, and some of the first
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.360]   people to ever settle the frontier, and that
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.680]   frontier mindset really does come from them. We
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.760]   owe them just as much we do the Puritans, but
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.800]   they don't ever really get their due. And the
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.600]   reason I recommend that book is if you read that
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   book, and you understand then, you know, how
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.080]   exactly could this group of white working class
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   voters forego from 2012 voting for a man named
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.280]   Barack Hussein Obama to Donald J. Trump, you
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.760]   really seem to—it makes perfect sense if you
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.600]   combine it with a lot of the stuff I'm talking
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.960]   about here, about affirmative action, about
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.040]   distrust of the elites, about feeling as if
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.640]   institutions are not seeing through to you, and
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.800]   specifically also not valuing your contribution
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.680]   to American history, and in some cases, actively
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.280]   looking down. I'm glad you pointed out not only
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.560]   their role in the Revolutionary War, but in the
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.320]   Civil War as well, and just how much of a
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.600]   contribution culturally, really, that we owe
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.400]   them for setting the groundwork that so many of
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.800]   us who came later could build upon and adopt
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.200]   some of their own ideas and their culture as our
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.360]   own. It's one of the things that makes America
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:52.680]   great.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.920]   Marc Twain.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.000]   I mean, so much of the culture, so much of the
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.280]   yeah, the American spirit, the whole idea, the
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.440]   whole shape and form and type of populism that
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.240]   represents our democracy. So would you trace
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.440]   that fierce individualism that we think of back
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.920]   to them?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.160]   Definitely. It's a huge part of them, about who
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.240]   they were, about the screw you attitude. I mean,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.120]   that book actually kind of had a renaissance back
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.640]   in 2016 when Hillbilly Elegy came out. I'm sure
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.080]   you remember this, which it's kind of weird to
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.200]   think that it's now the vice president-elect of
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.080]   the United States. It's kind of wild, honestly,
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.920]   to think about. But J.D. Vance's book, Hillbilly
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.880]   Elegy, I think was really important for a lot of
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   American elites who were like, how do these
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.080]   support people support Trump? Where does this
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.920]   shit come from? That they're really I mean, if
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.840]   you really think back to that time, it was
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.720]   shocking to the elite character that any person
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.000]   in the world could ever vote for Donald Trump
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.360]   and not just vote. He won the election. How does
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.760]   that happen? And that's Hillbilly Elegy guided
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.560]   people in an understanding of what that's like
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.800]   on a lived day to day basis. And J.D., to his
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.840]   credit, talks about the Scots-Irish heritage,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.080]   about Appalachia and the legacy of what that
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.120]   culture looks like today and how a lot of these
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.040]   people voted for Donald Trump. But we got to give
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.000]   credit to Jim Webb, who wrote the history of
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   these people and taught me and you about their
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.800]   original fight against the oppressors in
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.120]   Scotland and Ireland and their militant spirit
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.320]   and how they were able to bring that over here.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.960]   And, you know, they got their due in Andrew
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.080]   Jackson and some of our other populist
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.280]   presidents who set us up on the road to Donald
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.040]   Trump to where we are today. Dude, it got me
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.600]   pumped, excited to be an American. Me too. I love
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.360]   that book. It's crazy that J.D., the same guy,
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.200]   because that's, Hillbilly Elegy is what I kind
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.000]   of thought of him as. Yeah. I mean, I'll tell you
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.760]   for me, it's actually pretty surreal. I met J.D.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.040]   Vance in like 2017 in like a bar. I didn't ever
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.200]   think he would be the vice president-elect of
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.440]   the United States. I mean, it's kind of wild.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.600]   One of my friends went back and dug up the
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.320]   email that we originally sent him, just like,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.520]   "Hey, do you want to meet up?" And he's like,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.760]   "Sure." I was watching on television. I mean, the
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.280]   first time that it really hit me, I was like,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.080]   "Whoa." It was like naming a history book. It's
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.000]   whenever he became the vice presidential
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.920]   nominee. I was watching on TV and the confetti
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.000]   was falling and he was waving with his wife. And
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.440]   I was like, "Wow, like, that's it. You're in the
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.000]   history books now forever, especially now. So as
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.640]   the literal vice president-elect of the U.S.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.120]   But his own evolution is actually a fascinating
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.880]   story for us, too, because I think a lot of the
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.320]   time I've spent right now is kind of- a lot of
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.440]   what I'm giving right now are like 2016 kind of
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.480]   takes about like why Trump won that time. But we
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.960]   should spend a lot of time on how Donald Trump
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.440]   won this election and how what happened, some of
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.160]   the failures of the Biden administration, some of
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.000]   the payback for the Great Awakening. But also if
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.800]   you look at the evolution of J.D. Vance, this is
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.520]   a person who wrote "Hillbilly Elegy." And not a
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.840]   lot of people pay attention to this, but if you
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.680]   read "Hillbilly Elegy," J.D. was much more of a
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.600]   traditional conservative at that time. He was
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.400]   citing, you know, report- I think the famous
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.320]   passage about like payday loans and why they're
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.080]   good or something like that. I don't know his
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.400]   position today, but I would assume that he's
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.960]   probably changed that. But the point is, is that
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.280]   his ideological evolution from watching somebody
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.640]   who really was more of a traditional Republican
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.360]   with a deep empathy for the white working class,
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.160]   then eventually become a champion and a disciple
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.440]   of Donald Trump and to believe that he himself
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.360]   was the vehicle for accomplishing and bettering
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.480]   the United States, but specifically for working
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.080]   class Americans really of all stripes. And that
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.360]   story is really one of the rise of the modern
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.200]   left as it exists as a political project, as an
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.000]   ideology. It's also one of the Republican Party,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.520]   which coalesced now with Donald Trump as a
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.200]   legitimate figure and as the single bulwark
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.720]   against cultural leftism and elitism that
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.600]   eventually was normalized to the point that
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.640]   majority of Americans decided to vote for him in
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.400]   2024. So let's talk about 2024. What happened
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   with the left? What happened with Biden? What's
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.840]   your take on Biden? Biden is, I try to remove
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.880]   myself from it. And I try not to give like hit
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.040]   big history takes while you're in the moment.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.440]   But it's really hard not to say that he's one of
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.840]   the worst presidents in modern history. And I
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.480]   think the reason why I'm going to go with it is
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.400]   because I want to judge him by the things that
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.440]   he set out to do. So Joe Biden has been the same
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.240]   person for his entire political career. He is a
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.280]   basically C student who thinks he's an A student.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.720]   The chip on his shoulder against the elites has
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.360]   played to his benefit in his original election to
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.240]   the United States Senate, through his entire
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.680]   career as the United States Senator, where he
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.160]   always wanted to be the star and the center of
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.440]   attention, and to his 1988 presidential
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.840]   campaign. And one of the most fascinating things
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.200]   about Biden and watching him age is watching him
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.120]   become even more of what he already was. And so
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.440]   book recommendation, it's called what it takes.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.400]   And it was written in 1988. And there's actually
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.920]   a long chapter on Joe Biden, and about the
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.280]   plagiarism scandal. And one of the things that
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.840]   comes across is his sheer arrogance and belief in
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.200]   himself as to why he should be the center of
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.720]   attention. Now, the reason I'm laying all this
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.120]   out is the arrogance of Joe Biden, the individual
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.400]   and his character is fundamentally the reason
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.080]   this presidency went awry. This is a person who
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.560]   was elected in 2020, really, because of a feeling
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.880]   of chaos of Donald Trump of we need normalcy
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.120]   decides to come into the office portrays himself
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.800]   as a quote unquote transitional president slowly,
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.600]   you know, begins to lose a lot of his faculties,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   and then surrounds himself with sycophants, the
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.520]   same ones who have been around him for so long,
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.600]   that he had no single input into his life to tell
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.840]   him that he needed to stop and need to drop out
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.920]   of the race until it became truly undeniable to
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.120]   the vast majority of the American people. And
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.360]   that's why I'm trying to keep it as like him as
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.960]   an individual as a president, because we can
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.000]   separate him from some of his accomplishments and
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   the things that happen. Some I support some I
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   don't. But generally, a lot of people are not
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.560]   gonna look back and think about Joe Biden and the
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.320]   Chips Act. A lot of people are not going to look
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.480]   back and think about Joe Biden and the build back
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.520]   better bill or whatever his Lena Khan antitrust
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.560]   policy, they're going to look back on him and
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.480]   they're going to remember high inflation, they're
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.760]   going to remember somebody who fundamentally never
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.640]   was up to the job in the sense that one, again,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.560]   book recommendation freedom from fear by David
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.320]   Kennedy is about the Roosevelt years. And one of
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.400]   the most important things we will understand is
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.920]   the New Deal didn't really work in the way that a
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.400]   lot of people wanted it to write, like there was
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.680]   still high unemployment, there was still a lot of
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.480]   suffering. But you know what changed, they felt
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.960]   that they had a vigorous commander in chief, who
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.560]   is doing everything in his power to attack the
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.640]   problems of the everyday American. So even though
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.080]   things didn't even materially change the vigor,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.920]   that's a term that was often associated with John
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.400]   F. Kennedy at Vega, you know, in the Massachusetts
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.000]   accent, we had this young, vibrant president in
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.080]   1960, and he was running around and he wanted to
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   convince us that he was working every single day
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.720]   tirelessly. And we have an 80 year old man who is
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.800]   simply just eating ice cream and going to the
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.440]   beach, while people's grocery prices and all the
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.320]   same go up by 25%. And we don't see the same
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.200]   vigor, we don't see the same action, the bias to
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.240]   action, which is so important in the modern
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.800]   presidency. That is fundamentally why I think the
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.200]   Democrats, part of the reason why the Democrats
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.360]   lost the election, and also why I think that he
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.960]   missed his moment in such a dramatic way. And he
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.680]   had the opportunity, he could have done it, you
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.280]   know, if he wanted to, but maybe 20 years ago, but
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.240]   the truth is that his own narcissism, his own
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.200]   misplaced belief in himself, and his own
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.480]   accidental rise to the presidency ended up in his
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.240]   downfall. And it's kind of amazing, because again,
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.320]   if we if we look back to his original campaign
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.920]   speech 2019, why I'm running for president, it was
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.760]   Charlottesville. And he said, I want to defeat
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   Donald Trump forever. And I want to make sure that
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.840]   he never gets back in the White House again. So by
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   his own metric, he did fail. That was his. It was
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.720]   the only thing he wanted to do. And he failed.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.360]   Failed from
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.200]   you said a lot of interesting stuff. So one FDR.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.600]   That's really interesting. It's not about the
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.160]   specific policy. It's about like fighting for the
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.200]   people and doing that with charisma and just
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.840]   uniting the entire country for a particular this is
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.000]   the same with Bernie. Like maybe there's a lot of
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.400]   people that disagree with Bernie that still
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.160]   support him because like we just want to be
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.560]   authentic. Yeah, that's it. We just want somebody
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.880]   to fight authentically for us. Yes, FDR people
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.040]   really need FDR was like a king. He was like Jesus
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.440]   Christ. Okay, and in the US, and some of it was
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.480]   because of what he did. But it was just the fight.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.640]   So people need to go back and read the history of
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.880]   the first 100 days under FDR, the sheer amount of
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.160]   legislation that went through his ability to bring
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.560]   Congress to heel and the Senate, he gets all this
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.560]   stuff through. But as you and I know, legislation
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.440]   takes a long time to put into place, right? We've
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.400]   had people starving on the streets all throughout
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.680]   1933. Under under Hoover, the difference was Hoover,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.440]   which was seen as this do nothing joke, who would
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.520]   dine nine course meals in the White House and he
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.200]   was a filthy rich banker. FDR comes in there. And
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.520]   every single day has him fireside chats, he's
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.720]   passing legislation. But more importantly, so he
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.880]   tries various different programs, then they get
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.120]   ruled unconstitutional, he tries even more. So
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.280]   what does America take away from that every single
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.960]   time if he gets knocked down, he comes back
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.920]   fighting. And that was a really part of his
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.360]   character that he developed after he got polio. And
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.240]   it was it gave him the strength to persevere
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.640]   through personally, what he could transfer in his
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.440]   calm demeanor, and his feeling of fight that
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.960]   America really got that spirit from him, and was
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.520]   able to climb itself out of the Great Depression.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.560]   He's such an inspirational figure. He really is.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.080]   And I people think of him for World War Two, of
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.800]   course, you know, we can spend forever on that.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.160]   But in my opinion, the the early years are not
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.320]   studied enough. 33 to 37 is one of the most
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.480]   remarkable periods in American history. We were
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.160]   not ruled by a president, we were ruled by a king
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.240]   by a monarch and people liked it. He was a he was
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.680]   a dictator. And he was a good one.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:01.160]   Yeah, so to sort of push back against the implied
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.120]   thing that you said, so when saying Biden is the
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.000]   worst president, no second worst in modern
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.880]   history, that's right. So second modern history,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.520]   who's the worst W, no question, I see because of
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.040]   the horrible wars, probably I mean, Iraq is just
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.440]   so bad. Like, one of my favorite authors is a guy
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.040]   Gene Edward Smith, he's written a bunch of
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.400]   presidential biographies. And in the opening of
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.800]   his book, W biography, he's like, there's just no
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.640]   question, there's a single worst foreign policy
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.320]   mistake in all of American history. And W is one
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.200]   of our worst presidents ever. He had terrible
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.720]   judgment, and got us into a war of his own
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   choosing. It was a disaster. And it set us up for
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   failure. It By the way, we talked a lot about
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.000]   Donald Trump, nobody is more responsible for the
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.200]   rise of Donald Trump than George W. Bush. But I
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.640]   could I could go off on Bush for a long time. Oh,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.960]   we will return there. So as part of the pushback,
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.160]   I'd like to say, because I agree with your
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.840]   criticism of arrogance and narcissism against Joe
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.640]   Biden. The same could be said about Donald Trump,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.320]   you're absolutely of arrogance. So and I think
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.600]   you've also articulated that a lot of presidents
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.680]   throughout American history have suffered from a
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.720]   bad case of arrogance and narcissism.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.560]   Absolutely. But it's sometimes for a benefit,
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.240]   you know, you have to be a pretty crazy person to
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.880]   be to want to be president. I, you know, I had
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.000]   put out a tweet that got some controversy. And I
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.720]   think it was Joe Rogan, who I love, but he was
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.560]   like, I want to find out who Kamala Harris is as
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.680]   a human being. And I was like, I'm actually not
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.240]   interested in who politicians are as human
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.440]   beings at all. I was like, I've read too much
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.880]   about them to know. I know who you are. If you
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.080]   spend your life, and because I live in Washington,
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.880]   and I spent a lot of time around would be
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.000]   politicians, I know what it takes to actually
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.280]   become the president. It's crazy. You have to
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.560]   give up everything, everything, every night,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.200]   you're not spending it with your wife, you're
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.120]   spending it at dinner with potential donors, with
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.760]   friends, with people who can connect to every even
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.680]   after you get elected, that's even more so now
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.280]   you got to raise money. And now you're on to the
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.960]   next thing. Now you want to get your political
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.400]   thing through, you're gonna spend all your time
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.040]   on your phone, you and your staff are going to
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.520]   be more like this. Your entire life revolves
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.120]   around your career. It's honestly, you need an
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.960]   insane level of narcissism to do it. Because you
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.160]   have to believe that you are better than everybody
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.640]   else, which is already pretty crazy. And not only
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.920]   that, your own personal characteristics and
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.440]   foibles lead you to the pursuit of this office,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.400]   and to the pursuit of the idolatry of the self,
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.040]   and everything around you. There's a famous story
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.120]   of Lady Bird Johnson, after Johnson becomes the
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.320]   president, he's talking to the White House
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.040]   Butler. And she was like, everything in this
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.600]   house revolves around my husband, whatever's left
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.840]   goes to the girls, her two children, and I'll take
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.760]   the scraps. So everything revolved around
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.040]   Johnson's political career, and his daughters
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.480]   when they're honest, because they like to paper
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.720]   over some of the things that happened under him,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.240]   but they didn't spend any time with him.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.800]   Saturday, Saturday morning was for breakfast
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.000]   with, you know, Richard Russell, I forget. These
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.440]   are all in the Robert A. Carrow books. Sunday was
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.160]   for Rayburn, there was no time for, you know, for
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.840]   his kids. That's what it was. And by the way, he's
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.120]   one of the greatest politicians to ever live. But
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.280]   he also died from a massive heart attack. And he
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.000]   was a deeply sad and depressed individual.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.920]   Yeah, I saw that tweet to go back to that. Yeah.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.080]   And also, I listened to your incredible debate
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.920]   about it with Marshall on the realignment podcast,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   and I have to side with Marshall, I think you're
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.560]   just wrong on this. Because I think revealing the
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.400]   character of a person is really important to
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.640]   understand how they will act in a room full of
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.560]   generals and full of...
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.080]   Yeah, this gets to the judgment question.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.680]   The judgment. And that's, I think of Johnson and
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.560]   of Nixon, of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR, I can
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.720]   give you a laundry list of personal problems that
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.760]   all those people had. I think they had a really,
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.880]   really good judgment. And I'm not sure how
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.800]   intrinsic their own personal character was to
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.880]   their exploration and thinking about the world.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.480]   So JFK is actually JFK might be our best example,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.280]   because he had the best judgment out of anybody
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   in the room as a brand new president in the Cuban
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.720]   Missile Crisis. And he got us out and avoided
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.080]   nuclear war, which he deserves eternal credit for
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.720]   that. But how did he arrive to good judgment?
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.440]   Some of it certainly was his character. And we
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.680]   can go again, though, into his laundry list of
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.600]   that. But most of it was around being with his
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.240]   father, seeing some of the mistakes that he would
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.560]   make. And he was also had a deeply inquisitive
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.000]   mind. And he experienced World War Two at the
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.520]   personal level after PT 109. So it is, look, I
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.280]   get it, I actually could steal man. And I could
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.240]   the response to what I'm saying is judgment is
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.680]   not divisible from personal character. But just
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.600]   because I know a lot of politicians, and I've
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.080]   read enough with the really great ones, the
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.000]   people who I revere the most, there's really bad
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.160]   personal stuff, basically every single time.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.560]   But you're saying the judgment was good.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.520]   His judgment was great.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.120]   On the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yes. Some of the
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.280]   best judgment and decision making in the history
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.360]   of America. Yes. And we should study a lot of it.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.200]   And I encourage people out there. This is a
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.280]   brutal text. We were forced to read it in
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.920]   graduate school. The Essence of Decision by
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.200]   Graham Allison. I'm so thankful we did. It's one
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.840]   of the foundations of political science because
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.120]   it lays out theories of how government works.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.920]   This is also a useful transition, by the way, if
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.040]   we want to talk about Trump and some of his
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.720]   cabinet and how that is shaping up, because
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.520]   people really need to understand Washington.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.880]   Washington is a creature with traditions, with
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.480]   institutions that don't care about you.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.720]   They don't even really care about the
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   president. They have self-perpetuating
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.240]   mechanisms which have been done a certain way.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.840]   And it usually takes a great shocking event like
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.040]   World War Two to change really anything beyond
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.720]   the marginal. Every once in a while you have a
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.760]   figure like Teddy Roosevelt who's actually able
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.680]   to take peacetime presidency and transform the
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.840]   country. But it needs an extraordinary individual
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.280]   to get something like that done. So the question
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.240]   around the Essence of Decision was the theory
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.520]   behind the Cuban Missile Crisis of how Kennedy
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.160]   arrived at his decision. And there are various
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.320]   different schools of thought. But one of the
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.040]   things I love about the book is it presents a
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.560]   case for all three, the organizational theory,
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.840]   the bureaucratic politics theory, and then kind
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.240]   of the great man theory as well. So there's, you
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.760]   know, you and I could sit here and I could tell
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.360]   you a case about PT 109 and about how John F.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.680]   Kennedy experienced World War Two as this, I
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.920]   think he was like a first lieutenant or
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.400]   something like that, and how he literally swam
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.880]   miles with a wounded man's life jacket strap in
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.440]   his teeth with a broken back, and he saved him,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.040]   and he ended up on the cover of Life magazine,
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.800]   and he was a war hero. And he was a deeply smart
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.080]   individual who wrote a book in 1939 called Why
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.240]   England Slept, which to this day is considered a
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.800]   text which at the moment was able to describe in
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.080]   detail why Neville Chamberlain and the British
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.000]   political system arrived at the policy of
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.400]   appeasement. I actually have a original copy. It's
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.880]   one of my most prized possessions, because from
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.520]   1939, because this is a 23 year old kid, who the
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.920]   fuck are you, John F. Kennedy? Turns out he's a
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.160]   brilliant man. And another just favorite aside is
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.000]   that at the Potsdam Conference, you know, where
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.800]   Harry Truman is there with Stalin and everybody.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.200]   So in the room at the same time, Harry S.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.120]   Truman, President United States, Dwight D.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.760]   Eisenhower, the general, right, who will succeed
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.840]   him, 26 year old John F.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.400]   Kennedy, as a journalist, some shithead
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.760]   journalist on the side, and all three of those
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.800]   presidents were in the same room with Joseph
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.680]   Stalin and others. And that that's the story of
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.520]   America right there. It's kind of amazing. I love
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.720]   people to say that because you never know about
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.440]   who will end up rising to power.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.040]   Are you announcing that you're running?
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.720]   No, absolutely not. Yeah. I don't have what it
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.440]   takes. I don't think so. I'm self aware.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.840]   Yeah, well, maybe humility is necessary for
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.560]   greatness. Okay. So yeah, actually, can we just
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.880]   linger on that book? Yeah. So the book, Essence of
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.960]   Decision, Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis by
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   Graham Allison, it presents three different
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.560]   models of how government works, the rational
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.360]   actor model. So seeing government as one entity,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.800]   trying to maximize the national interest. Also
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.200]   seeing government is through the lens of the
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.120]   momentum of standard operating procedures, sort
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.480]   of this giant organization that's just doing
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.320]   things how it's always been done. And government
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.800]   politics model of there's just these individual
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.480]   internal power struggles within government. And
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.880]   all of that is like a different way to view and
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.000]   they're probably all true to a degree of how
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   decisions are made within this giant machinery
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.480]   of government.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.040]   That's why it's so important is because you
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.960]   cannot read that book and say one is true and one
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.160]   is not. You can say one is more true than the
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.480]   other, but all of them are deeply true. And this
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.240]   is one, this is probably a good transition to
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.800]   Donald Trump. Because, and I guess for the people
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.360]   out there don't think I've been up to obsequious,
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.480]   he'll be my criticism. Trump said something very
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.040]   fundamental and interesting on the Joe Rogan
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.760]   podcast, probably the most important thing that
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.560]   he ever said, which is he said, I like to have
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.160]   people like John Bolton in my administration
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.720]   will because they scare people. And it makes me
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.680]   seem like the most rational individual in the
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.040]   room. So at a very intuitive level, a lot of
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.680]   people can understand that. And then they can
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.080]   rationalize while there are picks that Donald
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.000]   Trump has brought into his White House, people
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.600]   like Mike Waltz and others that have espoused
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.200]   views that are directly at odds with a quote
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.720]   unquote, anti neocon, anti Liz Cheney agenda.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.120]   Now, Trump's theory of this is that he likes to
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.640]   have quote unquote, like psychopaths like John
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.520]   Bolton in the room with him while he's sitting
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.000]   across from Kim Jong Un, because it gets scared.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.200]   What I think Trump never understood when he was
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.760]   president, and I honestly question if he still
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.440]   does now, is those two theories that you laid
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.640]   out, which are not about the rational interest
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.120]   as the government is one model, but the
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.400]   bureaucratic theory and the organizational
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.720]   theory of politics. And because what Trump, I
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.080]   don't think quite gets is that there are 99
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.440]   percent of the decisions that get made in
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   government never reached the president's desk.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.280]   One of the most important Obama quotes ever is
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.040]   by the time it gets to my desk, nobody else can
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.560]   solve it. All the problems here are hard. All
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.160]   the problems here don't have an answer. That's
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.880]   why I have to make the call. So the theory that
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.040]   Trump has that you can have people in there who
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   are, let's say, warmongers, neocons or whatever
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.240]   who don't necessarily agree with you, is that
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.960]   when push comes to shove at the most important
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.440]   decisions that I'll still be able to rein those
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.080]   people in as an influence. Here's the issue.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.480]   Let's say for Mike Waltz, who's going to be the
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.960]   national security adviser, the lot of people
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.640]   don't really understand, you know, there's this
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.880]   theory of national security adviser where you
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.160]   call me into your office and you're the
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.480]   president. You're like, hey, what do we think
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.120]   about Iran? I'm like, I think you should do X, Y
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.800]   and Z. No, that's not how it works. The national
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.720]   security adviser's job is to coordinate the
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.480]   interagency process. So his job is to actually
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.800]   convene meetings, him and his staff, where in
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.640]   the Situation Room, CIA, State Department, Sec
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.200]   Def, others. Before the POTUS even walks in, we
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.680]   have options. So we're like, hey, Russia just
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.640]   invaded Ukraine. We need a package of options.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.400]   Those packages of options are going to concede
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.200]   of three things. We're going to have one group.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.080]   We're going to call it the dovish option. Two,
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.840]   we're going to call it the middle ground. Three,
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.360]   the hardcore package. Trump walks in. This is
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.880]   how it's supposed to work. Trump walks in and
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.240]   he goes, OK, Russia invaded Ukraine. What do we
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.200]   do? Mr. President, we've prepared three options
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.480]   for you. We got one, two and three. Now, who has
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.240]   the power? Is it Trump when he picks one, two or
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.440]   three? Or is the man who decides what's even in
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.880]   option one, two and three? That is the part where
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.080]   Trump needs to really understand how these
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.880]   things happen. And I watched this happen to him
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.920]   in his first administration. He hired a guy, Mike
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.240]   Flynn, who was his national security adviser. You
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.280]   could say a lot about Flynn, but him and Trump
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.680]   were at least like this on foreign policy. Flynn
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.520]   gets outed because what I would call an FBI coup,
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.240]   whatever. 33 days he's out as a national security
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.320]   adviser. H.R. McMaster. He's got a nice, nice
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.120]   shiny uniform, four star, all of this. McMaster
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.160]   doesn't agree with Donald Trump at all. And so
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.640]   Trump says, I ran on pulling out of Afghanistan.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.160]   I want to get out of Afghanistan. Like, yeah,
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.960]   we'll get out of Afghanistan. But before we get
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.120]   out, we got to go back in as we need more troops
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.960]   in there. And he's like, oh, OK. You know, it's
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.160]   like all this. And it proves a plan and
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.600]   effectively gives a speech in 2017 where he ends
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.960]   up escalating and increasing the number of
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.200]   troops in Afghanistan. And it's only till
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.480]   February 2020 that he gets to sign a deal, the
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.240]   Taliban peace deal, which, in my opinion, should
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.160]   have done in 2017. But the reason why that
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.440]   happened was because of that organizational
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.840]   theory of that bureaucratic politics theory where
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.600]   H.R. McMaster is able to guide the interagency
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.640]   process, bring the uniform recommendations of
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.400]   the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others to give
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.920]   Donald Trump no option but to say we must put
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.560]   troops. Another example of this is a book called
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.840]   Obama's War by Bob Woodward. I highly encourage
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.080]   people to read this book because this book talks
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.960]   about how Obama comes into the White House in
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.400]   2009. He says, I want to get out of Iraq and I
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.320]   don't want to increase. I want to fight the good
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.520]   war in Afghanistan. Right. And he's doing Obama's
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.680]   a thoughtful guy, too thoughtful, actually. And
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.160]   so he sits there and he's working out his
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.880]   opinions. And what he starts to watch is that
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.080]   very slowly his narrow his options begin to
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.880]   narrow because strategic leaks start to come out
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.280]   from the White House Situation Room about what
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.520]   we should do in Afghanistan. And pretty soon,
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.280]   David Petraeus and Stan McChrystal and the
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.200]   entire national security apparatus has Obama
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.040]   pegged, where he basically politically at the
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.240]   time decides to take the advantage advantage
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.960]   position of increasing troops in Afghanistan, but
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   then tries to have it both ways. But by saying,
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.080]   but in two years, we're going to withdraw. That
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.280]   book really demonstrates how the deep state can
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.480]   completely remove any of your options to be able
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.760]   to move by presenting you with ones which you
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.200]   don't even want and then making it politically
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.400]   completely infeasible to travel down the extreme
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   directions. That's why when Trump says things
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   like I want to get out of Syria, that doesn't
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.080]   compute up here for the Pentagon. Because first
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.840]   of all, you know, if I even asked you how many
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.680]   troops we have in Syria, and you go on the DOD
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.200]   website, it'll tell you a number that numbers
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.400]   bullshit, because the way they do it is if you're
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.560]   only there for 179 days, you don't count as
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.800]   active military contracts, the real numbers,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   let's say five times. And so Trump would be
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.440]   like, hey, I want to get out of Syria that it
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.080]   will do six months, right? We need six months
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.520]   after six months ago. So so are we out of Syria
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.240]   yet? And they're like, No, well, we got to wrap
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.000]   this up, we got this base, we got that we have
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.720]   this important mission. And, you know, next thing
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.000]   you know, you're not you're out of office, and
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.320]   it's over. So that there's there's all these
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.800]   things, which I don't think he quite understands.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.440]   I know that some of the people around him who
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.000]   disagree with these pics do is the reason why
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.200]   these pics really matter is not only the voices
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.600]   in the situation room for the really, really
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.520]   high profile stuff, it's for all the little
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.680]   things never get to that president's desk, of
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.760]   which can shape extraordinary policy. And I'll
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.560]   give you the best example. There was never a
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.800]   decision by FDR as President United States to
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.480]   oil embargo Japan, one which he thought about as
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.160]   deeply as you and I would want. It was a
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.400]   decision kind of made within the State
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.880]   Department. It was a decision that was made by
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.360]   some of his advisors, I think he eventually
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.400]   signed off on it. It was a conscious choice, but
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.280]   it was not one which ever was understood the
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.200]   implications that by doing that, we invite a
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.160]   potential response like Pearl Harbor. So think
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.000]   about, you know, what the organizational
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.440]   bureaucratic model can tell us about the
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.000]   extraordinary blowback that we can get, and why
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.720]   we want people with great judgment all the way
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.640]   up and down the entire national security chain
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.440]   in the White House. Also, I just realized I did
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.840]   not talk about immigration, which is so insane.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.600]   One of the reasons Donald Trump won in 2024, of
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.760]   course, was because of the massive change to the
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.160]   immigration status quo. The truth is, is that it
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.240]   may actually be second to inflation, in terms of
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.560]   the reason that Trump did win the presidency was
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.720]   because Joe Biden fundamentally changed the
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.680]   immigration status quo in this country. That was
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.040]   another thing about the Scots-Irish people and
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.920]   others that we need to understand is that when
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.800]   government machinery and elitism and liberalism
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.840]   appears to be more concerned about people who
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.120]   are coming here in a disorderly and illegal
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.920]   process, and about their rights and their, you
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.840]   know, ability to, quote unquote, pursue the
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.040]   American dream, while the American dream is
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.600]   dying for the native born population. That is a
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.000]   huge reason why people are turning against mass
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.840]   immigration. Historically as well, my friend
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.160]   Raihan Salaam wrote a book called Melting Pot or
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.360]   Civil War. And one of the most important parts
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.800]   about that book is the history of mass migration
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.520]   to the United States. So if we think about the
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.320]   transition from Scots-Irish America, to the
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.120]   opening of the of America to the Irish and to
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.480]   mass European immigration, we, what a lot of
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.920]   people don't realize is it caused a ton of
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.640]   problems. There were mass movements at that time,
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.120]   the Know Nothings and others in the 1860s, who
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.040]   rose up against mass European migration. They
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.840]   were particularly concerned about Catholicism by
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.760]   as the religion of a lot of the new immigrants.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.120]   But really what it was is about the changing of
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.320]   the American character by people who are not
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.560]   have the same traditions, values, and skills as
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.960]   the native born population and their
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.040]   understanding of what they're owed and their
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.200]   role in American society is very different from
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.960]   the way that people previously had. One of the
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.840]   most tumultuous periods of US politics was
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.880]   actually during the resolution of the
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.800]   immigration question, where we had massive waves
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.320]   of foreign born population come to the United
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.120]   States. We had them, you know, integrated,
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.360]   luckily, actually at the time with the industrial
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.320]   revolution. So we actually did have jobs for
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.040]   them. One of the problems is that today in the
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.400]   United States, we have one of the highest levels
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   of foreign born population than ever before
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.840]   actually since that time in the early 1900s. But
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.440]   we have all of the same attendant problems, but
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.160]   even worse is we don't live in an industrial
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.600]   economy anymore. We live in a predominantly
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.040]   service based economy that has long, you know,
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.920]   moved past manufacturing. Now, I'm not saying we
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.880]   shouldn't bring some of that back. But the truth
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.840]   is, is that manufacturing today is not what it
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.920]   was to work in a steel mill in 1875. I think we
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.080]   can all be reasonable and we can agree on that.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.640]   And part of the problems with extremely high
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.240]   levels of foreign born population, particularly
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.960]   unskilled, and the vast majority of the people
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.200]   who are coming here and who are claiming asylum
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.480]   are doing so under fraudulent purposes. They're
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.120]   doing so because they are economic migrants and
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.640]   they're abusing, you know, asylum law to basically
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.960]   gain entrance to the United States without going
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.360]   through a process of application or of merit. And
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.880]   this has all of its traces back to 1965, where the
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.360]   Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   really reversed and changed the status quo of
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.200]   immigration from the 1920s to 1960, which really
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.000]   shut down levels of immigration in the United
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.920]   States. In my opinion, it was one of the most
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.040]   important things that ever happened. And one of
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.720]   the reasons why is it forced and caused
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.400]   integration. It also forced by slowing down the
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.920]   increase in the number of foreign born
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.480]   population. It redeveloped an American character
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.200]   and understanding that was more homogenous and
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.920]   was the ability for you and me to understand
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.360]   despite the difference in our background. If you
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.680]   accelerate and you continue this trend of the
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.720]   very high foreign born unskilled population, you
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.640]   unfortunately are basically creating a mass, you
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.040]   know, on it's basically it's a non citizen
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.760]   population of illegal immigrants, people who are
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.480]   not as skilled. You know, I think it was I read
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.560]   27% of the people who've come under Joe Biden
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.400]   illegally don't even have a college degree. That
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.320]   means that we're lucky if they're even literate
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.960]   in Spanish, let alone English. So there are
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.040]   major problems about integrating that type of
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.200]   person. You know, even in the past, whenever we
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.120]   had a mass industrial economy, now imagine today,
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.400]   the amount of strain that would put on social
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.560]   services, if mass citizenship happened, you know,
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.760]   to that population would be extraordinary. And
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.280]   even if we were to do so, I don't think it's a
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.720]   good idea. But even if we were to do so, we would
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.080]   still need to pair it with a dramatic change. And
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.320]   part of the problem right now is I don't think a
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.200]   lot of people understand that immigration system,
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.240]   the immigration system in the United States,
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.960]   effectively, they call it family based migration, I
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.160]   call it chain migration. chain migration is the
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.560]   term, which implies that, let's say you come over
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.520]   here, and you get your green card, you can use
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.120]   sponsorship and others by gaming the quota system
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.440]   to get your cousin or whatever to be able to
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.520]   come. The problem with that is who is your cousin?
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.480]   Like, is he a plumber? Is he you know, does he
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.160]   have is he a coder, you know, that doesn't
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.480]   actually matter because he's your cousin. So
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.560]   actually his preference, the way that it should
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.680]   work is it should be nobody cares if he's your
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.360]   cousin. What's what does he do? You know, what
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.040]   does she do? What is she going to bring to this
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.160]   country? All immigration in the United States, in
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.000]   my opinion, should be net positive without doing
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.080]   fake statistics about, oh, they actually
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.120]   increased the GDP or whatever. It's like, we
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.520]   need a merit based immigration system. We are
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.560]   the largest country in the world. And one of the
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.760]   only non Western or one of the only Western
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.240]   countries in the world, it does not have a merit
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.520]   based points based immigration system, like
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.880]   Australia, and or Canada. And I mean, I get it
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.680]   because a lot of people did come to this country
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.640]   under non merit based purposes. So they're
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.440]   really reluctant to let that go. But I do think
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.520]   that Biden by changing the immigration status
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.920]   quo, and by basically just allowing, you know,
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.760]   10s of millions, potentially 10s of millions, at
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.200]   the very least 12 million new entrants to come to
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.240]   the US, under these pretenses of complete
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.560]   disorder, and have no conduct really broke a lot
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.400]   of people's understanding, and even like mercy in
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.760]   that regard. And so that was obviously a massive
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.800]   part of Trump's victory.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.000]   Speaking of illegal immigration, what do you
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.440]   think about the borders are? Tom Holman?
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.920]   Tom Holman is a very legit dude, got to know him
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.840]   a little bit and Trump 1.0. He is an original,
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.480]   like, true believer on enforcing immigration law,
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.520]   as it is. Now notice how I just said that that's
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.160]   a politically correct way of saying mass
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.720]   deportation. And I will point out for my left
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.800]   wing critics in that Yeah, he really believes in
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.000]   the ability and the in the ability in the
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.520]   necessity of mass deportation, and he has the
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.600]   background to be able to carry that out. I will
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.960]   give some warnings. And this will apply to doge
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.080]   to czar has no statutory or constitutional
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.280]   authority. czar has as much authority as the
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.520]   President of the United States gives him. Donald
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.200]   Trump, I think it's fair to say even as critics or
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.800]   even the people who love him could say he can be
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.760]   capricious at times. And he can strip you or not
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.600]   strip you or give you the ability to compel. So
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.480]   czar in and of itself is frankly a very flawed
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.680]   position in the White House. And it's one that I
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.160]   really wish we would move away from. I understand
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.280]   why we do it. It's basically to do a national
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.200]   security advisor interagency convener to
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.760]   accomplish certain goals. That said, there is a
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.400]   person Stephen Miller, who will be in the White
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   House, the Deputy White House Chief of Staff, who
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.640]   has well founded beliefs, experience in
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.200]   government, and a rock solid ideology on this,
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.400]   which I think would also give him the ability to
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.360]   work with home and to pull that off. That said, a
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.520]   corollary to this, and frankly, this is the one I
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.880]   am the most mystified yet, is Kirstie Noem, as the
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.240]   Department of Homeland Security Secretary. So let
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.560]   me just lay this out for people because people
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.240]   don't know what this is. Department of Homeland
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.480]   Security, 90% of the time, the way you're gonna
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.400]   interact with them is TSA. You don't think about
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.880]   it. But people don't know the Department of
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.560]   Homeland Security is one of the largest law
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.960]   enforcement, if maybe the largest law enforcement
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:07.040]   agency in the world. It's gigantic. You have
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.840]   extraordinary statutory power to be able to prove
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.480]   investigations. You have Border Patrol, ICE, TSA,
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.200]   CBP, all these other agencies that report up to
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.960]   you. But most importantly, for this, you will be
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.200]   the public face of mass deportation. So I was
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.280]   there in the White House briefing room last time
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.320]   around when Kirsten Nielsen, who was the DHS
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.720]   secretary under Donald Trump, and specifically
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.560]   the one who enforced child separation for a
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:36.320]   limited period of time, she was a smart woman. She
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.120]   has long experience in government. And honestly,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.240]   she melted under the criticism. Kirstie Noem is
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.640]   the governor of South Dakota. I mean, that's
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.040]   great. You have a little bit of executive
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.840]   experience. But to be honest, I mean, you have
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.520]   no law enforcement background. You have no
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.160]   ability to, you have no, frankly, with
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.120]   understanding of what it is going to be like to
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.240]   be the secretary of one of the most controversial
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.600]   programs in modern American history. You have to
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   go on television and defend that every single
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.720]   day, a literal job requirement under Donald
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.760]   Trump. And you will have to have extraordinary
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.880]   command of the facts. You have to have a very
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.240]   high intellect, you have to have the ability to
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.160]   really break through. And I mean, we all watch
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.200]   how she handled that situation with her dog and
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.960]   her interviews. And that does not give me
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.120]   confidence that she will be able to do all that
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.240]   well in the position.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   So what do you think is behind that? So Crystal
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.840]   Falls, your breaking point is that there's some
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:36.000]   kind of interpersonal, like, I didn't know, I
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.320]   guess I should know this, but I didn't know any
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.120]   of the, there was some cheating or whatever.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.120]   There's a rumor, nobody knows if it's true, that
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.080]   Corey Lewandowski and Kirstie Noem had a
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.400]   previous relationship and ongoing. Corey
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.720]   Lewandowski is a Trump official and that he
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.720]   maybe put her in front. I don't know.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.600]   Is this like the Real Housewives of DC?
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.320]   Yeah, kind of. Although, I mean, it was the most
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.120]   open secret in the world. Allegedly, I don't
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.600]   know if it's true. Okay. All right. I mean, I
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.280]   don't like to traffic too much in personal
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.720]   theories, but I mean, in this respect, it might
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.560]   actually be correct in terms of how it all came
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.720]   down. I have no idea what he's thinking to be. I
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.560]   truly don't. I mean, maybe it's like he was last
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.160]   time. He said, I want a woman who's like softer
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.760]   and like emotionally and the ability to be the
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.200]   face of my immigration program. I mean, again,
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.560]   like I said, I don't see it in terms of her
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.760]   experience and her media. It's frankly like not
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.200]   very good. So you think she needs to be able to
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:31.440]   articulate, not just be like the softer face of
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.880]   this radical policy, but also be able to
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.960]   articulate what's happening with the reasoning
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.760]   behind all this? You need to give justification
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.360]   for everything. Here's the thing. Under mass
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.640]   deportation, the media will drag up every sob
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.920]   story known to planet Earth about this person
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.680]   and that person who came here illegally and why
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.880]   they deserve to stay. And really what the quasi
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.720]   thing is, that's why the program itself is bad
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.160]   and we should legalize everybody who's here
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.440]   illegally. Okay. So the thing is, is that you
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.400]   need to be able to have extraordinary oversight.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.440]   You need a great team with you. You need to make
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.400]   sure that everything is being done by the book.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.120]   The way that the media is being handled is that
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.280]   you throw every question back in their face and
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.480]   you say, well, you know, you either talk about
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.880]   crime or you talk about the enforceability of
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.720]   the law, the necessity. I mean, I just, I think
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.480]   articulated a very coherent case for why we need
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.960]   much less high levels of immigration to the
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.240]   United States. And I am the son of people who
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.480]   immigrated to this country. But one of the
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.440]   favorite phrases I heard from this, from a guy
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.520]   named Mark Corian, who's the center for
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.240]   immigration studies, is we don't make immigration
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.720]   policy for the benefit of our grandparents. We
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.120]   make immigration policy for the benefit of our
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.400]   grandchildren. And that is an extraordinary and
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.240]   good way to put it. And in fact, I would say it's
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.520]   a triumph of the American system that somebody
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.440]   whose parent family benefited from the
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.760]   immigration regime and was able to come here. My
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.720]   parents had PhDs, came here legally, applied,
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.160]   spent thousands of dollars through the process,
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.080]   can arrive at the conclusion that actually we
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.920]   need to care about all of our fellow American
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.080]   citizens. I'm not talking about other Indians or,
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   you know, whatever. I'm talking about all of it.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.040]   I care about everybody who is here in this
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.840]   country. But fundamentally, that will mean that
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.880]   we are going to have to exclude some people from
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.240]   the U.S. And I mean, another thing that the open
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.600]   borders people don't ever really grapple with is
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.480]   that even within their own framework, it makes no
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.080]   sense. So, for example, a common left wing talking
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.960]   point is that it's America's fault that El
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.480]   Salvador and Honduras and Central America is
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.520]   fucked up. And so because of that, we have a
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.240]   responsibility to take all those people in
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.160]   because it's our fault or Haiti. Right. But, you
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.680]   know, if you think about it, America is
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.720]   responsible, and I'm just being honest, for
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.360]   destroying and ruining a lot of countries. They
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.000]   just don't benefit from the geographic like
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.080]   ability to walk to the United States. So, I mean,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.440]   if we're doing grievance politics, Iraqis have
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.680]   way more of a claim to be able to come here than
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.480]   anybody from El Salvador who's talking about
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.840]   something that happened in 1982. So within its
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.760]   own logic, it doesn't make any sense. Even under
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.360]   the asylum process, you know, people I mean,
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.880]   people don't even know this. You're literally
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.640]   able to claim asylum from domestic violence. OK,
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.560]   there are I mean, imagine that like that's
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.040]   frankly, that is a local law enforcement and
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.520]   problem of people who are experiencing that in
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.800]   their home country. I know how cold hearted this
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.360]   sounds. But maybe honestly, it could be because
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.520]   I'm Indian. One of the things that whenever you
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.080]   visit India, and you see a country with over a
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.000]   billion people, you're like, holy shit, you know,
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.600]   this, this is crazy. And you understand both the
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.960]   sheer numbers of the amount of people involved.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.600]   And also, there is nothing in the world you
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.800]   could ever do to solve all problems for
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.160]   everybody. It's a very complex and dynamic
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.960]   problem. And it's really nice to be bleeding
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.640]   heart and to say, Oh, well, we have
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.040]   responsibility to this and to all mankind and
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.640]   all that. But it doesn't work. It doesn't work
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.160]   with a nation state. It doesn't work with a
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.280]   sovereign nation. We're the luckiest people in
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.520]   the history of the world to live here in this
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.440]   country. And it you need to protect it. And
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.000]   protecting it requires really thinking about the
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.560]   fundamentals of immigration itself and not
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.320]   telling us stories like what there's a famous
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.640]   moment in the Trump White House, where Jim
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.920]   Acosta, CNN, White House correspondent got into
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.760]   it with Stephen Miller, the current, you know,
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.240]   he'll be the current deputy chief. And he was
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.280]   like, what do you say something along the lines
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.320]   to people who say you're violating, you know,
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.040]   that quote on the Statue of Liberty, like,
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.320]   give me you're tired, you're poor, you're
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.160]   hungry, all of that, the Emma Lazarus quote. And
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.120]   Stephen, very logically was like, what level of
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.600]   immigration comports with the Emma Lazarus
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.640]   quote? Is it 200,000 people a year? Is it 300?
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.000]   Is it 1 million? Is it 1.5 million? And that's
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.600]   such a great way of putting it because there is
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.120]   no limiting principle on Emma Lazarus quote,
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.680]   there is when you start talking honestly, you're
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.680]   like, okay, we live in X, Y and Z society with X,
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.640]   Y and Z GDP, people who are coming here should
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   be able to benefit for themselves and us not
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.000]   rely on welfare, not, you know, be people who we
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.560]   have to take, take care of after because we have
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.720]   our own problems here right now. And who are the
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.200]   population, the types of people that we can
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   study and look at who will be able to benefit?
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.800]   And based on that, yeah, immigration is great.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.720]   But there are a lot of economic, legal, and
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.760]   societal reasons for why you, you definitely
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.680]   don't want the current level. But another thing
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.000]   is, even if we turn the switch, and we still let
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.440]   in a million five people a year, under the chain
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.080]   base, the chain family based migration, I think
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.680]   it would be a colossal mistake, because it's not
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.160]   rooted in the idea that people who are coming to
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.160]   America are explicitly doing so at the benefit of
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.240]   America, it's doing so based on the familial
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.560]   connections of people who already gained the
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.680]   immigration system to be able to come here. I
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.120]   have a lot of family in India. And you know, I
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.680]   love them, but and some of them are actually very
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.960]   talented and qualified. If they want to come here,
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.800]   I think they should be able to apply on their own
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.640]   merit. And that should have nothing to do with
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.360]   their familial status to the fact that I'm a US
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:57.800]   citizen.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   Like you mentioned the book Melting Pot or Civil
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.200]   War by Raihan Salam, he makes an argument against
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.720]   open borders. The thesis there is assimilation
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.720]   should be a big part. I guess there's some kind
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.960]   of optimal rate of immigration, which allows for
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:14.600]   assimilation.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.800]   Yeah. And there are ebbs and flows. That's kind
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.600]   of what I was talking about historically, where,
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.720]   you know, I mean, the truth is, is you could walk
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.600]   the streets of New York City in the early 1900s
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.360]   and late 1890s. And you're not gonna hear any
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.120]   English. And I think that's bad. I mean, really,
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.840]   what you had was ethnic enclaves of people who
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.880]   were basically practicing their way of life, just
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.200]   like they did previously, bringing over a lot of
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.480]   their ethnic problems that they had, and even some
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.080]   of their cultural, like unique capabilities or
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.360]   whatever, bringing it to America, and then New
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.040]   York City police and others are figuring out,
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   like, what the hell do we do with all this? And
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.680]   it literally took shutting down immigration for
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.160]   an entire generation to do away with that. And
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.360]   there's actually still some. The point about
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.560]   assimilation is twofold. One is that you should
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.280]   have the capacity to inherit the understanding of
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   the American character that has nothing to do
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.720]   with race. And that's so unique that I can sit
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.680]   here as a child of people from India and has
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.400]   such a deep appreciation for the Scots-Irish. I
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.560]   consider myself, you know, American first. And
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.320]   one of the things that I really love about that
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.960]   is that I have no historical relationship to
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.800]   anybody who fought in the Civil War. But I feel
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.360]   such kinship with a lot of the people who did,
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.600]   and reading the memoirs and the ideas of those
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.440]   that did, because that same mindset of the
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.920]   victors and the values that they were able to
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.520]   instill in the country for 150 years later, gives
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   me the ability to connect to them. And that's
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.440]   such an incredible victory on their part. And
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.280]   that's such a unique thing. In almost every
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.560]   other country in the world, in China, in India,
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.600]   or wherever, you're kind of like what you're what
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.640]   you are, you're a Hindu, you're a Jew, you're,
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.360]   you know, you're Han Chinese, you're Uyghur, or
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.640]   you're Tibetan, something like that. You're born
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.920]   into it. But really here was the only one of the
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.960]   only places in the world where you can really
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.560]   connect to that story, and that spirit, and the
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.720]   compounding effect of all of these different
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.600]   people who have come to America. And that is a
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.880]   celebration of immigration as an idea. But
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.760]   immigration is also a discrete policy. And that
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.720]   policy was really screwed up by the Biden
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.760]   administration. And so we can celebrate the idea
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.880]   and also pursue a policy for all of the people in
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.840]   the US are citizens to actually be able to
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.840]   benefit. And look, it's going to be messy. And
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.160]   honestly, I still don't know yet if Trump will be
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.800]   able to pursue actual mass deportation, just
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.080]   because I think that I'm not sure the public is
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.280]   ready for I do support mass deportation. I don't
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.280]   know if the public is ready for it. I think I
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.800]   don't know, I'll have to see because there's a
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.240]   lot of different ways that you can do it. There's
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.040]   mandatory verify, which requires businesses to
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.720]   basically verify or US citizen or illegally
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.600]   whenever they employ you, which is not the law of
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.360]   the land currently, which is crazy, by the way.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.320]   There's, you know, you can cut off or tax
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.280]   remittance payments, which are payments that are
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.760]   sent back to other countries like Mexico,
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.320]   Honduras and Guatemala. Again, illustrating my
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.520]   economic migrant point. There are a lot of
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.760]   various different ways we just make it more
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.640]   difficult to be illegally here in the US so
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.200]   people will self deport. But, you know, if he
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.600]   does pursue like real mass deportation, that will
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.720]   be a that will be a flashpoint in America.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.200]   Aren't you talking about things like what Tom
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.240]   Holman said works at raids, sort of increasing
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.120]   the rate of that?
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.480]   Yeah, we used to do that.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.280]   You know, yeah, but there's a rate at which you
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.000]   can do that, where it would lead to, I mean,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.880]   radical social upheaval.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.000]   Yeah, it will. I mean, and I think some people
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.040]   need to be honest here. And this actually flies
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.200]   in the face of, I mean, one of the most common
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.400]   liberal critiques is this is going to raise
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:52.160]   prices. And yeah, I think it's true. I think it's
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.080]   worth it. But that's easy for me to say. I'm
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.240]   making a good living. If you care about
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.280]   inflation, you voted for Donald Trump and your
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.320]   price of groceries or whatever goes up because
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.120]   of this immigration policy. I think that needs
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.760]   to be extremely well articulated by the
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.240]   president. And of course, he needs to think
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.800]   about it. The truth is, is America right now is
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.120]   built on cheap labor. It's not fair to the
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.320]   consumer. It's not fair to the immigrants, the
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.160]   illegal immigrants themselves. And it's not
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.440]   fair to the natural born citizen. The natural
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.760]   born citizen has his wages suppressed for
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.280]   competition by tens of millions of people who
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.000]   are willing to work at lower wages that compete
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.640]   for housing, for social services. I mean, just
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.280]   even, you know, like basic stuff at a societal
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.640]   level, it's not fair to them. It's definitely
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.240]   not fair to the other person because, I mean,
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.800]   whenever people say like, who's going to build
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.680]   your houses or whatever, you're endorsing this
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.880]   quasi-illegal system where, you know, uninsured
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.200]   laborers from Mexico, they have no guarantee of
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.960]   wages. They're getting paid cash under the
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.880]   table. They are living, you know, 10 to a room.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.280]   They're sending Mexican remittance payments
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.000]   back just so that their children can eat. I
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.400]   mean, that's not really fair to that person
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.120]   either. So that's the point. The point is, is
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.720]   that it will lead to a lot of social upheaval.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.600]   But this gets to my Kirstie Noem point as well
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.120]   is you need to be able to articulate a lot of
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.960]   what I just said here, because if you don't,
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.440]   it's going to go south real quick.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.400]   The way Vivek articulates this is that our
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.800]   immigration system is deeply dishonest. Like we
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.440]   don't acknowledge some of the things you just
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:24.720]   said.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.960]   And he wants to make it honest. So if we don't
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.760]   do mass deportation, at least you have to be
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.600]   really honest about the living conditions of
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.240]   illegal immigrants, about basically mistreatment
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:37.680]   of them.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.640]   Yes, it's true. I mean, you know, if you support
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.200]   mass illegal migration, you're basically
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   supporting tens of millions who are living
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.920]   lives as second-class citizens. That's not fair
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.920]   to them. I also think it's deeply paternalistic.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.600]   So there's this idea that America has so ruined
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   these Central American countries that they have
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.320]   no agency whatsoever, and they can never turn
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.480]   things around. What does that say about our
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.320]   confidence in them? You know, one of the things
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.760]   they always say there, "Oh, they're law-abiding.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.840]   They're great people," and all that. I agree,
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.920]   okay? By and large, I'm not saying these are bad
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.640]   people, but I am saying, like, if they're not
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.960]   bad and they're law-abiding and they're citizens
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.680]   and thoughtful and all that, they can fix their
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.080]   own countries. And they did in El Salvador.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.160]   That's the perfect example. Look at the
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.800]   dramatic drop in their crime rate. Bukele is
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.280]   one of the most popular leaders in all of South
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.280]   America. That is proof positive that you can
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.120]   change things around, despite, perhaps, the
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.840]   legacy of U.S. intervention. So, you know, to
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.520]   just say this idea that, you know, because it's
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.280]   America's fault that they're screwed up, it
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.480]   takes agency away from them. You know, another
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.680]   really key part of this dishonesty, this really
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.560]   gets to Springfield and the whole Haitian thing,
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.160]   because everybody, you know, beyond the eating
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.920]   cats and dogs, everybody does not even
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.040]   acknowledge, because when they're like, "The
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.760]   Haitians are here legally," they need to
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.560]   actually think about the program. The program is
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.360]   called TPS, so let me explain that. TPS is called
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.920]   Temporary Protected Status. Note, what's the
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.360]   first word in that? Temporary. What does that
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.040]   mean? TPS was developed under a regime in which,
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.880]   let's say that there was a catastrophic, I think
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.360]   this is a real example, I think there was like a
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.800]   volcano or an earthquake or something, where
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.840]   people were granted TPS to come to the United
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.520]   States. And the idea was they were going to go
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.400]   back after it was safe. They just never went
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.560]   back. There are children born in the United
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.400]   States today who are literally the descent, who
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.520]   are adults, who are the descendants of people
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.600]   who are still living in the U.S. under TPS.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.320]   That's a perfect example of what Vivek says is
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.760]   dishonest. You know, you can't mass de facto
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.880]   legalize people by saying that they're here
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.840]   temporarily because of a program or because of
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.080]   something that happened in their home country,
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.680]   when the reality is that for all intents and
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.360]   purposes, we are acknowledging them as full
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.880]   legal migrants. So, you know, even the term
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.320]   migrant to these Haitians in Springfield makes
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.120]   no sense because they're supposed to be here
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.440]   under TPS. Migrant implies permanency. So
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.160]   the language is all dishonest. And people don't
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.920]   want to tell you about the things I just said
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.640]   about chain migration. You know, the vast
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.960]   majority of Americans don't even know the
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.840]   immigration system works. They don't understand
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.800]   what I just said about TPS. They don't really
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.120]   understand the insanity of asylum law, where you
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.840]   can just literally throw up your hands and say,
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840]   I fear for my life. And you get to live here for
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.840]   four or five years before your court date even
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.240]   happens. And, you know, by that time, get a work
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.120]   permit or whatever. You can, you know, get
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.880]   housing, like you just said, in substandard
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.120]   conditions. And you can kind of just play the
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.720]   game and wait before a deportation order comes.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.280]   And even if it does, you never have to leave
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.040]   because there's no ICE agent or whatever who's
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.280]   going to enforce it. So the whole system is nuts
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.600]   right now. And we need complete systematic
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.280]   reform that burns it all to the ground.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.920]   That said, sort of the image and the reality of
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.880]   a child being separated from their parents seems
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.840]   deeply un-American, right?
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.560]   Well, I mean, look, it gets, okay, so, you know,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.000]   I'm not going to defend it, but I'll just put it
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   this way. Nobody hate children. Yeah. See, this
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.120]   is what I mean. Do you think twice whenever you
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.040]   see a drug addict who's put in prison and their
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:12.160]   child is put in protective services? Nobody in
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.280]   America thinks twice about that, right? Right.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.800]   So, I mean, well, that's kind of screwed up.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.000]   Well, we should think about why did we come to
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.920]   that conclusion? The conclusion was that these
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.240]   adults willingly broke the law and pursued a path
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.720]   of life, which put them on a, you know, which
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.920]   put them on a trajectory where the state had to
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.920]   come in and determine that you are not allowed
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.040]   to be a parent, basically, to this child while
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.360]   you serve your debt to society. Now, child
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.200]   separation was very different. Child separation
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.560]   was also a product of extremely strange
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.040]   circumstances in U.S. immigration law, where
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.760]   basically at the time, the reason why it was
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.080]   happening was because there was no way to
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.320]   prosecute people for illegal entry without child
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.800]   separation, because previous doctrine, I believe
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.120]   it's called the Flores Doctrine, under some
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.360]   asylum law. People will have to go check my work
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.600]   on this. But basically, the whole reason this
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.840]   evolved as a legal regime was because people
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.680]   figured out that if you bring a kid with you
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.680]   because of the so-called Flores Doctrine or
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.160]   whatever, that you couldn't be prosecuted for
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.880]   illegal entry. So it was a de facto way of
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.600]   breaking the law. And in fact, a lot of people
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.880]   were bringing children here who weren't even
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.880]   theirs, who weren't they weren't even related to
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.440]   or couldn't even, you know, prove it, were
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.800]   bringing them to get around the prosecution
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.080]   for illegal entry. So I'm not defending child
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.160]   separation. I think it was horrible or whatever.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.600]   But, you know, if I give you the context, it
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.040]   does seem like a very tricky problem in terms
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.800]   of do we enforce the law or not? How are we
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.120]   able to do that? And the solution, honestly, is
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.200]   what Donald Trump did was remain in Mexico and
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.040]   then pursue a complete rewrite of the way that
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.360]   we have U.S. asylum law applied and of asylum
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.960]   adjudication and really just about enforcing our
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.840]   actual laws. So when I try to explain to people
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.240]   is the immigration system right now is a
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.240]   patchwork of this deeply dishonest, such a great
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.240]   word, deeply dishonest system in which you use
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.520]   the system and set it up in such ways that
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.880]   illegal immigration is actually one of the
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.680]   easiest things to do to accomplish immigration
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.760]   to the United States. That is wrong. My parents
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.320]   had to apply. It wasn't easy. Do you know, in
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.160]   India, there's a temple called the Visa Temple
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.360]   where you walk one hundred and eight times around
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.440]   it, which is like a lucky number. And if you do
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.840]   it when you're applying for a visa to the United
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.640]   States. All right. It costs a lot of money and
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.120]   it's hard. People get rejected all the time.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.720]   There's billions of people across the world who
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.200]   would love to be able to come here. And many of
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.240]   them want to do so legally. And they should have
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.280]   to go through a process. The current way it
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.560]   works is it's easier to get here illegally than
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.880]   it is legally. I think that's fundamentally
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.800]   right. It's also unfair to people like us whose
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.800]   parents did come here illegally.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.680]   Can you steel me on the case against
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.240]   mass deportation? What are the strongest
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   arguments?
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.720]   The strongest argument would be that these
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.320]   people contribute to society, that these people,
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.240]   many of whom, millions of here, have been here
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.040]   for many years, have children, natural born
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.520]   citizens because of birthright citizenship. It
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.480]   would require something that's fundamentally
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.800]   inhumane and un-American, as you said. The idea
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.120]   of separating families, you know, across
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.560]   different borders simply because of what is a
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.920]   quote unquote, like, small decision of coming
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.920]   here illegally. And the best case beyond any of
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.480]   this moral stuff for no mass deportation is it's
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.320]   good for business. Illegal immigration is great
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.920]   for big business. It is great for big
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.760]   agriculture. So if you want the lowest prices
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.440]   of all time, then yeah, mass deportation is a
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.440]   terrible idea.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.920]   But first of all, very convincing. And second
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.840]   of all, you can't just do mass deportation
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.960]   without also fixing the immigration system.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.480]   Yes, exactly. And I mean, there are there's
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.680]   several pieces of legislation, H.R.2. That's
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.880]   something that the Republicans have really
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   coalesced around. It's a border bill. I
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.720]   encourage people to go read it and see some of
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.240]   the different fixes to the U.S. immigration
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.040]   system. I'm curious whether it'll actually
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.080]   pass or not. Remember, there's a very slim
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.920]   majority of the House of Representatives for
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.640]   Republicans this time around. And people vote
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.240]   for a lot of things when they're not in power.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.720]   But when it's actually about to become the law,
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.520]   we'll see. There's a lot of swing state people
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.280]   out there who may think twice before casting
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.760]   that vote. So I'm definitely curious to see how
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.520]   that one plays out. The other thing is, is
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.040]   that, like I just said, the biggest
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.160]   beneficiary of illegal immigration is big
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.600]   business. So if you think they're going to
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.600]   take this one lying down, absolutely not. They
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.120]   will fight for everything that they have to
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.280]   keep their pool of cheap labor because it's
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.640]   great for them. You know, I think J.D. said a
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.120]   story. I think he was on Rogan about how he
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.600]   talked to a hotelier chain guy. And he was
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.280]   just he was like, yeah, it's just terrible.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.560]   You know, it's like they would take away our
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560]   whole workforce. And he was like, do you hear
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.080]   yourself in terms of what you're talking?
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.120]   You're bragging about. But that's real. That's
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.800]   a real thing. And that, you know, Tyson's
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.560]   foods and all these other people like, you
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.480]   know, that's another really sad part is what
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.600]   I mean by second class citizenship is this
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.640]   presumption, first of all, that Americans
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.880]   think it's too disgusting to process meat or
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.920]   to work in a field. I think anybody will do
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.520]   anything for the right wage, first of all. But
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.240]   second is, you know, the conditions in a lot
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.960]   of those facilities are horrible and they're
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.000]   covered up for a reason, not only in terms of
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.480]   the way that businesses like they actually
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.920]   conduct themselves, but also to cover up
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.120]   their illegal immigrant workforce. So honestly,
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   I think it could make things better for
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.400]   everything. You have studied how government
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.080]   works. What are the chances mass deportation
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.920]   happens? It depends. I define it. So I mean,
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.080]   mass deportation can mean one million. I mean,
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.400]   nobody even knows how many people are here
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.960]   illegally. It could be 20 million. It could be
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.200]   30 million. I've seen estimates of up to 30
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.920]   million, which is crazy. That's almost one
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.640]   eleventh of the entire U.S. population. What
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.240]   number do you think will feel like mass
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.440]   deportation? One million people? A million
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.960]   people is a lot. I mean, that's a lot of
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.000]   people. That's a lot. I mean, but the crazy
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.600]   part is that's only one twelfth of what Joe
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.080]   Biden let in the country. So that's one of
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.760]   those that just to give people the scale of
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.040]   what it will all look like. Do I think mass
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.160]   deportation will happen? It depends on the
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.720]   definition. Will one million over four years?
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.840]   Yeah, I feel relatively confident in that.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.280]   Anything over that, it's going to be tough to
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.120]   say. Like I said, probably the most efficient
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.800]   way to do it is to have mandatory verify and
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.760]   to have processes in place where it becomes
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.440]   very difficult to live in the United States
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.840]   illegally. And then you will have mass self
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.800]   deportation and they will take the victory lap
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.480]   on that. But actual like rounding millions of
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.840]   people up and putting them in deportation
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.560]   facilities and then arranging flights to God
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.880]   knows all across the globe. That's a
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.120]   logistical nightmare. It also costs a lot of
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.440]   money. And don't forget, Congress has to pay for
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:55.120]   all of this. So, you know, we can have doge or
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.400]   we can have mass deportation. So those two
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.440]   things are kind of irreconcilable. Actually,
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.880]   there's a lot of competing influences at play
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.120]   that people are not being real about at all.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.560]   Yeah, that was one of the tensions I had
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.640]   talking to Vivek is he's big on mass
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.880]   deportation and big on making government more
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.720]   efficient. And it really feels like there's a
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.640]   tension between those two in the short term.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.600]   Well, yes, absolutely. Also, I mean, this is a
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.200]   good segue. I've been wanting to talk about
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.680]   this. I am sympathetic to doge to the whole
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.920]   Department of Government Efficiency.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.960]   How unreal is it that it's called doge?
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.520]   Actually, with Elon, it's quite real. I guess
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.960]   I've just, you know, I've accepted Elon as a
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.760]   major political figure in the US. But the doge
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.200]   committee, the Department of Government
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.360]   Efficiency, is a non statutory agency that has
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.800]   zero funding that Donald Trump says will advise
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.680]   OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. Now,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.000]   two things. Number one is, as I predicted, doge
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.800]   would become a quote unquote, blue ribbon
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.880]   commission. So this is a non statutory blue
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.760]   ribbon commission that has been given authority
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.200]   to Vivek Ramaswamy and to Elon Musk. Secondary,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   their recommendations to government should be
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.960]   complete by July of 2026. According to the
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.880]   press release, released by Trump. First of all,
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   what that will mean is they're probably gonna
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.680]   need private funding to even set all this up.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.760]   That's great, not a problem for Elon. But
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.920]   you're basically going to be able to have to
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.760]   commission GAO reports, Government
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.720]   Accountability Office, and other reports and
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.520]   fact finding missions across the government,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.960]   which, which is fantastic. Trump can even
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.360]   empower you to go through every agency and to
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.160]   collect figures. None of it matters one iota. If
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.880]   Republican appropriators in the House of
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.760]   Representatives care what you have to say.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.040]   Historically, they don't give a shit what the
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.840]   executive office has to say. So every year, the
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.680]   president releases his own budget. It used to
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.040]   mean something, but in the last decade or so,
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.120]   it's become completely meaningless. The House
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.760]   Ways and Means Committee, and the People's
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.520]   House are the ones who originate all
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.040]   appropriations and set up spending. So that's
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.680]   one is that doge in and of itself has no power.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.840]   It has no ability to compel or force people to
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.280]   do anything. Its entire case for being, really,
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.120]   if you think about it mechanically, is to try
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.520]   and convince and provide a report to Republican
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.840]   legislators to be able to cut spending. So
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.960]   that's that. Now, we all know what how
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.120]   Congress takes to government reports and
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.240]   whether they get acted on or not. So that's
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.400]   number one. Number two, is the figures that
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.720]   Elon is throwing out there. I again, I want to
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.080]   give them some advice because people do not
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.120]   understand federal government spending. The
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:36.880]   absolute vast majority of government spending is
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.440]   entitlement programs like Social Security, and
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.360]   Medicare, which are untouchable under Donald
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.720]   Trump and their most politically popular
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.320]   programs in the world, and military spending,
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.840]   discretionary non military spending, I don't
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.800]   have the exact figure in front of me is a very,
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.520]   very small part of the federal budget. Now,
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.560]   within that small slice, about 90% of that eight
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.560]   is bipartisan and is supported by like
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.720]   everybody, Noah, you know, the hurricane guys,
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.280]   like people like that, you know, people are
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.320]   flying into the eye of the hurricane, people who
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.960]   are government inspectors of X, Y, and Z. The
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.560]   parts that are controversial that you're
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.520]   actually able to touch things like welfare
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.920]   programs, like food stamps is an extraordinary
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.160]   small slice. So there, what's the number he put
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.960]   out there? 5 trillion, something like that.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.240]   There is only one way to do that. And it
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.000]   realistically under the current thing, you have
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.720]   to radically change the entire way that the
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.600]   Pentagon buys everything. And I support that.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.920]   But I just want to be very, very clear, but I
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.240]   haven't seen enough energy around that there's
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.720]   a there's this real belief in the US that we
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.560]   spend billions on all of these programs that
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.160]   are doing complete bullshit. But like the
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.920]   truth, the absolute vast majority of it is
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.040]   military spending and entitlements. Trump has
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.360]   made clear entitlements are off the table, it's
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.680]   not gonna happen. So the way that you're going
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.240]   to be able to cut realistically military
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:01.080]   spending over a decade long period is to really
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.560]   change the way that the United States procures,
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.720]   you know, procures military equipment, hands out
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.240]   government contracts. Elon actually does have
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.600]   the background to be able to accomplish this
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.000]   because he has had to wrangle with SpaceX and
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.640]   the bullshit that Boeing has been pulling for
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.600]   over a decade. But I really want everybody's
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.240]   expectations to be very set around this. Just
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.080]   remember, non statutory blue ribbon. So if he's
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.640]   serious about it, I just laid out all of these
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.520]   hurdles that he's gonna have to overcome. And I'm
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.440]   not saying him and Vivek aren't serious dudes,
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.200]   but you got to really know the system to be able
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:35.960]   to accomplish this.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   So you just laid out the reality of how
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.720]   Washington works. To give the counterpoint that I
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.120]   think you're probably also rooting for is that
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.480]   one is a statement like Peter Thiel said, don't
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.680]   bet against Elon. Sure. One of the things that
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.600]   you don't usually have with blue ribbon is the
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.320]   kind of megaphone that Elon has. And I would
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.200]   even set the financial aspects aside, just the
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.520]   influence he has with the megaphone, but also
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.360]   just with other people who are also really
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.520]   influential. I think that can have real power
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.880]   when backed by sort of a populist movement.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.280]   I don't disagree with you. But let me give you
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.240]   a case where this just failed. So Elon endorsed
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.360]   who for Senate Majority Leader, Rick Scott,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.720]   right? Who got the least amount of votes in the
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.640]   U.S. Senate for GOP leader, Rick Scott. John
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.240]   Thune is the person who got it. Now, the reason
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.280]   I'm bringing that up, one of my favorite books,
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.920]   Master of the Senate by Robert Caro, part of the
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.920]   LBJ series, the Senate as an institution, it
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.760]   reveres independence. It reveres, I mean, the
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.280]   entire theory of the Senate is to cool down the
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.920]   mob that is in the House of Representatives and
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.360]   to deliberate. That's its entire body. They are
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:55.160]   set up to be immune from public pressure. Now,
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.520]   I'm not saying they can't be pressured, but that
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.160]   example I just gave on Rick Scott is a very
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.200]   important one of you. He literally endorsed
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.000]   somebody for leader. So did Tucker Carlson. So
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.320]   did a lot of people online. And only 13
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.320]   senators voted for Rick Scott. The truth is, is
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.680]   that they don't care. Like they're set up where
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.840]   they're marginally popular in their own home
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.400]   states. They'll be able to win their primaries.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.160]   And that's all they really need to do to get
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.680]   elected. And they have six year terms, not even
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.000]   up for four years. So will Elon still be
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.920]   interested in politics six years from now? That's
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.040]   a legitimate question for a Republican senator.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.960]   So maybe he could get the House of
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.240]   Representatives to sign off maybe on some of his
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.120]   things. But there's no guarantee that the Senate
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.560]   is going to agree with any of that. There's a
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.280]   story that Karos tells in the Master of the
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.640]   Senate book, which I love, where Thomas
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.400]   Jefferson was in Paris during the writing of the
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.160]   Constitution. And he asked Washington, he said,
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.440]   why did you put in a Senate, a bicameral
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.640]   legislature? And Washington said, why did you
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.880]   pour your tea into a saucer? And Jefferson goes
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.360]   to cool it. And Washington says, just so. It was a
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   man of very few words. He was a brilliant man.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.000]   Okay, so you actually outlined the most likely
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.960]   thing that's going to happen with Doge as it
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.800]   hits the wall of Washington. What is the sort
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.720]   of the most successful thing that can be pulled
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.240]   off? The most successful thing they could do is
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.080]   right now, I think they're really obsessed with
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:25.920]   designing cuts, right, and identifying cuts. I
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.000]   would redesign systems, systems of procurement, I
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.280]   would redesign the way that we have processes in
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.840]   place to dispense taxpayer dollars. Because the
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.920]   truth is, is that appropriations itself, again,
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.320]   are set by the United States Congress. But the
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.000]   way that those appropriations are spent by the
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.960]   government, the executive has some
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.600]   discretionary authority. So your ability as the
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.840]   executive to be a good steward of the taxpayer
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.480]   money, and to redesign a system, which actually
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.400]   I think Elon could be good at this and Vivek too,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.760]   in terms of their entrepreneurial spirit is the
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.720]   entire Pentagon procurement thing, it needs to be
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.760]   burned to the ground. Number one, it's bad for
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.640]   the Pentagon, it doesn't get some substandard
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:10.600]   equipment, it rewards very old weapons systems
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.800]   and programs and thinking that can be easily
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.280]   defeated by people who are studying that for
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:18.120]   vulnerabilities. The perfect example is all of
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.960]   this drone warfare in Ukraine and in Russia. I
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:24.760]   mean, drone warfare costs almost nothing. And yet
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.960]   drone swarms and hypersonic missiles pose huge
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.560]   dangers to US systems, which costs hundreds of
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.160]   more than hundreds of billions of dollars. So my
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.600]   point is that giving nimble procurement and
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.480]   systemic change in the way that we think about
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.320]   executing the mission that Congress does give
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.520]   you actually could save the most amount of money
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.280]   in the long run. That's where I would really
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.720]   focus in on. The other one is, you know, counter
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.520]   to everything I just said, is maybe they listen.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.120]   Maybe the Republicans are like, yeah, okay, let's
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:00.440]   do it. The problem again, though, is swing state
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.600]   people who need to get reelected, they need to do
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.400]   one thing they need to deliver for their
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.440]   district, they need to run on stuff. And nobody
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.000]   has ever run on cutting money for your state.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.120]   They have run on bringing money to your state. And
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.920]   that's why earmarks and a lot of these other
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.400]   things are extraordinarily popular in Congress is
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.680]   because it's such an easy way to show
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.080]   constituents how you're working for them whenever
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:26.720]   it does come reelection time. So it's a very
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:29.200]   difficult system. And I also want to tell people
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.040]   who are frustrated by this, I share your
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.760]   frustration. But the system is designed to work
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.720]   this way. And for two centuries, the Senate has
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.920]   stood as a bulwark against literally every popular
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.800]   change. And because of that, it's designed to
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.800]   make sure that it's so popular for long enough
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.920]   that it has to become inevitable before the
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.920]   status quo can change. That's really, really
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:52.120]   frustrating. But you should take comfort in that
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.360]   it's always been that way. So it's been okay.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.760]   Well, as I've learned from one of the
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.000]   recommendations of the age of acrimony, as I feel
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.240]   embarrassed, I didn't know that senators used to
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.840]   not be elected. What a crazy system, huh? Yeah, I
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:08.760]   mean, many of the things we take for granted now,
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:15.040]   as defining our democracy, was kind of invented,
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.480]   developed after the Civil War in the sort of 50
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.960]   years after the Civil War. Absolutely correct. Age
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.360]   of acrimony. Oh my God, I love that book. I cannot
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.640]   recommend it enough. It is so important. And one
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.960]   of the biggest mistakes that Americans make is
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.480]   that we study periods where greatness happened.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.640]   But we don't often study periods where nothing
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.960]   happened or where really bad shit happened. You
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.400]   know, we don't spend nearly enough. Americans know
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.040]   about FDR. They don't really know anything about
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.840]   the Depression or how we got there. What was it
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.320]   like to be alive in the United States in 1840?
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.600]   Right? Nobody thinks about that, really, because
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.560]   it's kind of an in-between time in history. There
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.040]   are people who lived their entire lives, who were
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.280]   born, who had to live through those times, who
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.160]   were just as conscientious and intelligent as you
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.800]   and I are, and we're just trying to figure shit
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.280]   out. And things felt really big. So the age of
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.600]   acrimony is a time where it's almost completely
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.000]   ignored outside of the Gilded Age aspect. But
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.440]   like you just said, it was a time where progressive
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.480]   reform of government and of the tension between
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:17.680]   civil rights, extraordinary wealth, and democracy
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.080]   and really the reigning in of big business. So
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.160]   many of our foundations happened exactly in that
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.920]   time. And I take a lot of comfort from that book
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.920]   because one of the things I learned from the
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.880]   book is that voter participation is highest when
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.040]   people are pissed off, not being happy. And that's
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.360]   such a counterintuitive thing. But voter
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.400]   participation goes down when the system is
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.920]   working. So 2020, right, I think we can all agree
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.160]   it was a very tense election. That's also why it
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:46.840]   had the highest voter participation ever. 2024,
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:49.320]   very high rates of participation. Same thing.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.080]   People are pissed off. And that's actually what
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.560]   drives them to the vote. But something I take
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.560]   comfort in that is that people being pissed off
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.400]   and people going out to vote, it actually does
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.560]   have major impact on the system. Because
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.640]   otherwise, the status quo is basically allowed to
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.040]   continue. And so yeah, like you just said, I
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.400]   mean, direct election of senators wasn't I mean,
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.200]   there are probably people alive today who are
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.640]   like, who could who were born when there was no
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.000]   direct election of senators, which is an insane
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.960]   thing to think about. I mean, it'd be almost 100
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.960]   or so. But the point is, is that that time, it was
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.920]   so deeply corrupt. And it was one where the
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:25.800]   quasi aristocracy from the early days leading
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.080]   into the Gilded Age were able to enforce their
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.560]   will upon the people. But you can take comfort in
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.440]   that that was one of those areas where Americans
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.240]   were so fed up with it, they changed the
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.000]   Constitution, and actually forced the aristocrats
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.760]   in power to give their own power. It's like our
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.600]   version of when they flipped power and took away
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.880]   the legislative power of the House of Lords in
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:48.160]   the UK. I just think that's amazing. And it's
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.520]   such a cool thing about our country in the UK
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:50.800]   too.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.880]   It's the continued battle between the people and
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.640]   the elite. Right. And we should mention not just
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.120]   the direct election of senators, but the election
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.200]   of candidates for a party.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:05.720]   Yes.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.160]   That was also invented. It used to be that the
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:11.120]   quote unquote party bosses, I say that with a
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:15.040]   half a chuckle, chose the candidate.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.320]   Yeah, the whole system is nuts. The way that we
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.800]   currently experience politics is such a modern
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.200]   invention.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.840]   With a little asterisk with Kamala Harris, but
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.960]   Right. Yeah, good point. But that was actually
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.200]   more of a mean reversion, right? We're living in
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.120]   an extraordinarily new era where we actually have
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.200]   more input than ever on who our candidates are.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.760]   It used to be this is crazy. So the conventions
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.400]   have always took in place two months before.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.520]   Right. Imagine a world where you did not know who
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.320]   the nominee was going to be before that
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.760]   convention. And the nominee literally was
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.640]   decided at that convention by those party bosses.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.880]   Even crazier, there used to be a standard in
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.640]   American politics where presidents did not
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.240]   directly campaign. They, in fact, did not even
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.120]   comment about the news or mention their
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.720]   opponent's names. They were they give speeches
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.680]   from their doorstep, but it was unseemly for
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.920]   them to engage in direct politics.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.880]   You would not get a Bernie Sanders. You would
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.160]   not get a Donald Trump.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.880]   Obama, Bill Clinton. I mean, basically every
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.160]   president from John F. Kennedy onwards has been
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.200]   a product of the new system. Every president
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.240]   prior to that has been much more of the older
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.960]   system. There was a in between period post FDR
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.640]   where things were really changing. But the
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.360]   primary system itself had its first true big
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.600]   win under John F. Kennedy.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.080]   I think that the lesson from that is there's a
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.760]   collective wisdom to the people, right?
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.720]   I think so.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.520]   I think it works.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.160]   Yeah, I mean, well, OK, I'll steel Matt. We had
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.760]   some great presidents in the party boss era. FDR
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.840]   was a great president. FDR was the master of
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.440]   coalitional politics of his ability. In fact,
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.320]   what really made him a genius was his ability to
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.800]   get this overthrow the support of a lot of the
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.320]   corruption and the elite Democrats to take part
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.560]   or to take control. And they're at the convention
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.760]   and then combine his personal popularity to fuse
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.600]   all systems of power where he had the he had the
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.120]   he had the elites basically under his boot
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.840]   because he was the king and he used his popular
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.600]   power and his support from the people to be able
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.000]   to enforce things up and down. I mean, you know,
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.400]   even in the party boss era, we would have no a
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.920]   lot of the a lot of people we revere really came
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.280]   out of that. People like Abraham Lincoln. I mean,
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.480]   I don't think Abraham Lincoln would have won a
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.680]   party primary in 1860. There's no chance he won.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:32.160]   He won luck, thank God, from an insane process in
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.320]   the 1860 Republican Convention. People should go
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.360]   read about that because that was wild. I think we
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.720]   were this close to not having Lincoln as
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.400]   president. And yeah, I mean, Teddy Roosevelt,
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.400]   there's so many that I could point to who made
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.880]   great impacts on history. So the system does find
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.960]   a way to still produce good stuff. That was a
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.120]   kind of beautiful diversion from the Doge
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.440]   discussion. If we're going to turn briefly to
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.960]   Doge. Sure. So we kind of talked about cost
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.560]   cutting, but there's also increasing the
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.720]   efficiency of government, which you also kind of
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.840]   talked about with procurement. So maybe we can
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.240]   throw into the pile, the 400 plus federal
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.600]   agencies. So let's take another perspective on
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.840]   what success might look like. So like radically
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.760]   successful Doge, would it basically cut a lot of
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.120]   federal agencies? Probably combine, combine.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.080]   Okay, so I can give great examples of this
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.800]   because I have a great insight, like for each
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.440]   agency will often use different like payroll
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.520]   systems, they'll have different internal
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.480]   processes, right? That makes no sense. And it's
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.280]   all because it's antiquated. Now, everybody
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.880]   always talks about changing it. But there are a
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.800]   lot of, like, party interests about why certain
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.400]   people get certain things. The real problem with
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.600]   government, the people like us who are private,
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.280]   and like, for example, when you want to do
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.560]   something, you can just do it. So I was listening
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.920]   to a really interesting analysis about law
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.960]   enforcement, and the military. So I think the
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.920]   story was that the military was assigned, some
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.560]   National Guard guys were assigned to like help
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.800]   with the border. And they were trying to provide,
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.360]   I think it was translation services to people at
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.600]   Border Patrol. But somebody had to come down and
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.240]   be like, hey, this has got to stop. According to
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.480]   US Code X, Y, and Z, the United States military
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.920]   cannot help with law enforcement, you know,
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.600]   abilities here. And so even though that makes
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:28.320]   absolutely no sense, because they're all work,
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.960]   there are literal legal statutes in place that
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.680]   prevent you from doing the most efficient thing
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.960]   possible. So for some reason, we have to have a
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.600]   ton of Spanish speakers in South Com, you know,
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.160]   in the, the US command that is responsible for
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:43.360]   South America, who literally cannot help with a
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.360]   crisis at the border. Now, maybe you can find
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.600]   some legal chicanery to make that work. But man,
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.920]   you got to have an attorney general who knows
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.640]   what he's doing, you need a White House counsel,
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.040]   you need to make sure that shit stands up in a
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.480]   court of law. I mean, it's not so simple.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.400]   Whereas, let's say, you know, you have a software
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.600]   right here, and you want to get a new software,
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.720]   you can just do it, you can hire whoever you
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.560]   want. When you're the government, there's a
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.640]   whole process you got to go through about bidding.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.040]   And it just takes forever. And it is so
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.560]   inefficient. But unfortunately, the
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.400]   inefficiency is really derivative of a lot of
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.920]   legal statutes. And that is something that, yeah,
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.960]   again, actually, you know, radically successful
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.600]   doge, quote unquote, would be study the law, and
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.120]   then change it. Like, figure, instead of cost
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.120]   cutting, like, cut this program or whatever, like
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.240]   I just said about why do different systems use
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.400]   payroll, just say that you can change the statute
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.280]   under which new software can be updated, let's
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:44.680]   say, after 90 days, you know, I've heard stories
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.520]   of people who work for the government who still
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.840]   have like IBM mainframe, that they're still in
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.920]   2024, that they're still working, because those
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.760]   systems have never been updated. There's also a
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.880]   big problem with a lot of this clearance stuff.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.640]   That's where a lot of inefficiency happens,
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.240]   because a lot of contractors can only work
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:02.320]   based upon previous clearance that they already
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.760]   got. Achieving a clearance is very expensive.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.840]   It's very lengthy process. I'm not saying it
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.120]   shouldn't be talking about security clearance,
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.000]   but it does naturally, you know, create a very
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.360]   small pool that you can draw some contracts
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.200]   fund. And I even mean stuff like, like the
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.280]   janitor at the Pentagon needs a security
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.080]   service, right? So clearance, so there's only
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.080]   like five people who can even apply for that
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.440]   contract. Well, naturally, in an interim
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.720]   monopoly like that, he's going to jack his price
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.560]   up, because he literally has a moat around his
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.040]   product. Whereas if you were I are hiring a
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.680]   gent, whatever anybody for anything that type of
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.760]   credentialism and legal regime, it doesn't matter
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.960]   at all. So there are a million problems like
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.760]   this that people in government run into. And
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.960]   that is what I would see as the most successful.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.560]   You know, paperwork slows everything down, and
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:54.160]   it feels impossible to break through that in a
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.320]   sort of incremental way. It's so hard. It feels
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.320]   like the only way to do it is to literally shut
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   down agencies in some kind of radical way, and
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.320]   then build up from, from scratch. Of course, as
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.640]   you highlight, that's going to be opposed by a
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.000]   lot of people within government.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.880]   Yeah. Well, historically, there's only one way to
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.120]   do it. And it's a really bad answer. War.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.720]   War. Yeah. So I was gonna say, basically, you
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.600]   have the kind of consensus where, okay, all this
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.520]   stupid bureaucratic bullshit we've been doing,
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.320]   we need to, like, put that shit aside, get the
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.200]   fuck out of here, we need to win a war. So like,
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.520]   all the paperwork, you know, all the lawyers go
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.320]   go leave.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.040]   No, but I want people to really understand that,
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:43.280]   you know, up until 1865, or 1860, what I forget
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.360]   the exact year, we didn't even have national
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.640]   currency. And then we were like, well, we need a
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.160]   greenback. And prior to that, people would freak
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.800]   out if we were talking about having national
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.200]   currency, greenback backed by the, you know, the
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.400]   US government and all that. Not even a question
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.120]   passing like two weeks in the US Congress, an
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:04.480]   income tax eventually went away, but not even in
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.880]   the realm of possibility. And they decide to pass
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.960]   it. Same thing after World War One. And you think
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.000]   about how World War Two, I mean, World War Two
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.720]   just fundamentally changed the entire way the
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.280]   United States government works. Even the DHS,
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.080]   which I mentioned earlier, the Department of
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.600]   Homeland Security, it didn't even exist prior to
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.320]   9/11. It was done as response to 9/11 to coalesce
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.960]   all of those agencies under one branch to make
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.800]   sure that nothing like that could ever happen
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.360]   again. And so historically, unfortunately,
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.800]   absolute shitshow disaster war is the only thing
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.680]   that moves and throws the paperwork off the
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.640]   table. And I wish I wasn't such a downer, but I've
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.680]   just I've both I've read too much. And I've had
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:49.520]   enough experience now in Washington to just see
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:53.680]   how these dreams get crushed instantly. And I
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.720]   wish it wasn't that way. I mean, it's it's a cool
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.080]   idea. And I want people who are inspired, who are
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.760]   getting into politics to think that they can do
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.800]   something, but I want them to be realistic, too.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.400]   And I want them to know what they're signing up
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.120]   for whenever they do something like that. And the
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.160]   titanic amount of work it is going to take for you
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.240]   to be able to accomplish something.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.480]   Yeah, but I've also heard a lot of people in
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.960]   Silicon Valley laughing when Elon rolled in and
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.920]   fired 90% of Twitter. Here's this guy, Elon Musk.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920]   You are absolutely correct.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.120]   He knows nothing about running a social media
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.800]   company. Of course, you need all these servers, of
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.960]   course, you need all these employees. Right. And
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.240]   nevertheless, the service keeps running.
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:28.880]   He figured it out. And you have to give him
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.000]   eternal credit for that. I guess the difference
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.120]   is no, there was no law that he could fire him.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:36.880]   You know, there was no, there was no, like, like
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.200]   at the end of the day, he owned the company, you
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.280]   know, he had total discretion of his ability to
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.520]   move. So I'm not even saying his ideas are bad.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.360]   I'm saying that the ability that's what makes him
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.360]   such an incredible visionary entrepreneur, it's
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.320]   movement, it's deference at times to the right
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.560]   people, but also the knowledge of every individual
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.720]   piece of the machine and his ability to come in
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.200]   and to execute his full vision at any time and
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.720]   override any of the managers. So I talked
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.840]   previously about the professional managerial
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.200]   class and the managerial revolution. Elon is one
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.360]   of the few people who's ever built a
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.360]   multibillion-dollar company who has not actually
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.760]   fallen victim to the managerial revolution and
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.000]   against entrepreneurship and innovation that
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.760]   happens there. There are very few people who can
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.800]   do it. Elon, Steve Jobs. But, you know, what do
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.960]   we learn is that unfortunately, after Steve
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.080]   died, Apple basically did succumb to the
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.680]   managerial revolution and has become like the
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.000]   product, you know, they make all their money by
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.080]   printing services and making it impossible to
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.680]   leave this ecosystem as opposed to building the
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.200]   most cool product ever. As much as I love my
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.360]   vision pro, don't get me wrong.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.200]   I think you just admitted that you're part of a
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:43.560]   cult.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.680]   I know I literally am. I am. I fully admit it.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.560]   Yeah. Yeah. I miss Steve.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.520]   The grass is green on the other side. Come come
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.720]   join us. Okay. Whether it's Elon or somebody
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.280]   else, what what gives you hope about something
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.560]   like a radical transformation of government
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.120]   towards efficiency towards being more slim? What
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.880]   gives you hope that that that will be possible?
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.840]   Well, I wouldn't put it that way. I don't think
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.680]   slimness in and of itself is a good thing. What I
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.400]   care about is the relationship to people in its
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.520]   government. So the biggest problem that we have
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.480]   is that we have a complete loss of faith in all
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:23.160]   of our institutions. And I've really encouraged
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.240]   people, I don't think people can quite understand
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.440]   what the relationship between America and its
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.960]   government was like, after World War Two, and
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.400]   after FDR, like 90% of the people trusted the
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.160]   government. That's crazy. Like when the
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.160]   president said something, they were like, Okay,
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:42.680]   he's not lying. Think about our cynical attitude
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.160]   towards politicians today. That is largely the
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:48.360]   fault of Lyndon Johnson and of Richard Nixon, and
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:51.280]   that entire fallout period of Vietnam, Vietnam in
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.560]   particular really broke the American character
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.560]   and its ability and its relationship with
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.840]   government. And we've never recovered faith in
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.960]   institutions ever since that. And it's really
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:02.960]   unfortunate. So what makes me hopeful, at least
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.080]   this time, is anytime a president wins a popular
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.760]   vote and an election is they have the ability to
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.720]   reset and to actually try and build something that
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.920]   is new. And so what I would hope is that this is
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.400]   different from the first Trump administration, in
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.120]   which the mandate for Donald Trump is actually
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.320]   carried out competently. Yes, he can do his
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.960]   antics, which got him elected, you know, at this
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.720]   point, we can't deny it. McDonald's thing is
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.560]   hilarious. It's funny. It is. People love it.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.520]   People like the podcasting people like garbage
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.440]   truck, the garbage truck. Yeah, exactly. They
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.800]   like the stunts and he will always excel and he
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.480]   will continue to do that. There are policy and
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.280]   other things that he can and should do like the
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.600]   pursuit of no war, like solving the immigration
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.680]   question, and also really figuring out our
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.920]   economy, the way that it currently runs and
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.320]   changing it so that the actual American dream is
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:01.400]   more achievable. And housing is one of the chief
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.720]   problems that we have right now. The real thing
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.800]   is Donald Trump was elected on the backs of the
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.320]   working man. I mean, it's just true households
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.760]   under $100,000 voted for Donald Trump. Maybe they
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.440]   didn't do so for economic reasons. I think a lot
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.680]   of them did for for economic, a lot of them did
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.920]   for immigration, for cultural, but you still owe
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:20.440]   them something. And there is a, I would hope that
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.560]   they could carry something out in that respect
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.120]   that is not a similar continuation and chaotic
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.080]   vibe of the first time where everything felt like
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:32.560]   it exploded anytime with staffing with even his
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:35.080]   policy or what he cared about or his ability to
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.080]   pursue. And a lot of that does come back to
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.720]   personnel. So I'm concerned in some respects. I'm
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.920]   like, not thrilled in some respects. I'm happy in
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.920]   some respects, but it remains to be seen how he's
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.520]   going to do it to the degree it's possible to see
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:51.640]   Trumpism and Maga as a coherent ideology. What do
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.440]   you think are the central pillars of it?
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:58.160]   Maga is a rejection of cultural elitism. That's
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:00.600]   what I would say. Cultural elitism though, has
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.760]   many different categories. Immigration is one,
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.920]   right? Is that cultural elitism and cultural
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:09.440]   liberalism has a fundamental belief that
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:12.080]   immigration in and of itself is a natural good at
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.480]   any and all levels that all immigrants are like
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.400]   replacement level, that there is no difference
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.240]   between them. Cultural elitism in a foreign
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.720]   policy context, comes back to a lot of that human
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:25.760]   rights, democracy stuff that I was talking about
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:28.480]   earlier, which divorces American values from
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.440]   American interests, and says that actually
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:34.200]   American values are American interests. Cultural
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.640]   elitism and liberalism leads to the worship of
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.960]   the postal rights era bureaucracy that I talked
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.640]   about from those two books of DEI, quote unquote
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.880]   woke and of progressive social ideology. So I
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.520]   would put all those together as ultimately what
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.920]   Maga is, it is a screw you. I once drove past it
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.240]   was in rural Nevada and I was driving and I
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:00.960]   drove past the biggest sign I've ever seen
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.120]   political sign to this day. And it's just it was
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.400]   in 2020 and just said Trump, fuck your feelings.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.960]   And I still believe that is the most coherent
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.920]   Maga thing I've ever seen because everyone's
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.400]   always like, how can a neocon and Tulsi Gabbard
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.880]   and RFK and all these other people, how can they
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.840]   all exist under the same umbrella? And I'm like,
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.280]   it's very simple. All of them have rejected the
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:27.560]   cultural elite in their own way, certainly, but
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.800]   they've arrived at the same place. It's an
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.440]   umbrella. And it's an umbrella fundamentally,
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:35.640]   which has nothing to do with the status quo. And
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.960]   with the, you know, currently established
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.760]   cultural elite. That doesn't mean they're not
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:41.480]   elite, and they're not rich in their own regards.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.120]   That doesn't mean they don't disagree. But
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.240]   that's the one thing that unites the entire party.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:46.680]   And so that's the way I would put it.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.880]   Anticultural elite. Is that synonymous with
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.320]   anti establishment? So basic distrust of all
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.760]   institutions? Is elitism connected to
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:56.680]   institutions?
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.800]   Yes, absolutely. Because elites are the ones who
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.040]   runs our institutions. That said, anti
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.680]   establishment is really not the right word,
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.840]   because there are a lot of left wingers who are
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.240]   anti establishment, right? They are against that,
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.280]   but they're not anti cultural leftism. And
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.200]   that's the key distinction between MAGA and like
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:16.600]   left populism. Left populism basically does
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:19.760]   agree. They agree with like basic conceits like
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.520]   racism is one of the biggest problem facing
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.280]   America. They're like one of the ways that we
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.760]   would fix that is through class oriented economic
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:30.160]   programs in order to address that. But we
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.120]   believe in, I don't know, like reparations as a
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.280]   concept. It's just more about how we arrived
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:38.200]   there. Whereas in MAGA, we would say no, we
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.640]   actually don't think that at all. We think we
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.200]   have evolved past that. And we think that the
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.280]   best way to fix it is actually similar policy
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:47.560]   prescription, but the mindset matters a lot. So
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.600]   the real distinction between MAGA and like left
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.520]   populism really is on culture, trans in
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.240]   particular, orientation about actually
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.880]   immigration may be the biggest one. Because if
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:01.040]   you look at the history of Bernie Sanders, you
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.200]   know, Bernie Sanders was a person who railed
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.880]   against open borders and against mass migration
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:08.560]   for years. There are famous interviews of him
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.160]   on YouTube with Lou Dobbs, who's one of the
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.480]   hardcore, hardcore immigration guys. And they
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.600]   agree with each other. And Lou is like, Bernie's
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.160]   one of the only guys out there. Bernie, at the
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.840]   end of the day, he had to succumb to the cultural
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:23.160]   left and its changing attitudes on mass
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.680]   immigration. There are some famous clips from
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.960]   2015 in a Vox interview that he gave where he
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.320]   started. I think he started talking about how
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.760]   the open borders is a Koch brothers libertarian
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:36.440]   concept, right? Because Bernie is a basically of
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.920]   a European welfare state tradition. European
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.160]   welfare states are very simply understood. We
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.760]   have high taxes, high services, low rates of
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:47.200]   immigration, because we have high taxes and high
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.720]   services, we have a limited pool of people who
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:52.160]   can experience and take those services. He used
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.040]   to understand that he changed a lot of his
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:57.160]   attitude. Bernie also, I will say, look, he's a
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.600]   courageous man, and a courageous politician. You
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:02.120]   know, as late as 2017, he actually endorsed a
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.600]   pro life candidate, because he said that that
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.440]   pro life candidate was, you know, pro worker, and
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.640]   he's like, at the end of the day, I care about
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:10.960]   pro worker policy. He took a ton of shit for it,
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.920]   and I don't think he's done it since. So the sad
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:16.280]   part that's really happened is that a lot of left
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:19.760]   populist, you know, agenda and other has become
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.160]   subsumed, you know, in the hysteria around cultural
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.880]   leftism, woke ism, whatever the hell you want to
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.520]   call it. And that ultimately, that cultural
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.960]   leftism was the thing that really united, you
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:32.680]   know, the two wings of that party. And that's
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.720]   really why MAGA is very opposed to that. They're
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.160]   really not the same, but the left populist can
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:39.920]   still be anti establishment. That's the key.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.640]   It's interesting to think of the left cultural
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:48.280]   elite, subsuming, consuming Bernie Sanders, the
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.520]   left populist. So you think that's what happened?
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.320]   That's what I would say.
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.080]   What do you think happened in 2016? With Bernie?
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.120]   Is there a possible future where he would have
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.800]   won? You and Crystal wrote a book on populism
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:02.760]   2020. So from that perspective, just looking at
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:07.600]   2016, if he rejected woke ism at that time, by
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.080]   the way, that would be pretty gangster during
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:14.160]   2016. Would he have, because I think Hillary
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:18.040]   went towards the left more, right? Am I remembering
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:18.400]   that correctly?
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:22.120]   It was a very weird time. So, uh, yes and no, it
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:27.000]   wasn't full on BLM mania like it was in 2020, but
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.280]   the signs were all there. Uh, so the great
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.680]   awokening was in 2014. I know it's a ridiculous
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:37.080]   term. I love it. Please keep saying the origin,
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.120]   the great awakening is about the great religious
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.240]   revival in the United States. So people had, you
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:43.520]   know, because woke ism is a religion, you know,
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.960]   that's a common refrain. They were like, the
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.920]   great awokening is a really good term. So thank
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.960]   you for explaining the joke. Yeah. So the great
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:52.000]   awokening is basically when racial attitudes
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.560]   amongst college educated whites basically flipped
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.800]   on its head. There are a variety of reasons why
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.760]   this happened. Um, I really believe that Ta-Nehisi
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.840]   Coates is case for reparations in the Atlantic
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.400]   is one of those. It radicalized an entire
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.960]   generation of, uh, basically like white college
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.360]   educated women to think completely differently
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.920]   on race. It was during Ferguson. And then it
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:14.160]   also happened immediately after the Trayvon
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:17.360]   Martin case. Those two things really set the
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:21.640]   stage for the eventual BLM takeover of 2020. But
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.640]   fundamentally what they did is they changed
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.920]   racial attitudes amongst college educated elites
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.960]   to really think in a race first construct. And
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.640]   worse is that they were rejected in 2016 at the
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:35.200]   ballot box by the election of Donald Trump. And
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.680]   in response, they ramped it up because they
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.960]   believed that that was the framework to view the
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:42.160]   world that people voted for Trump because he was
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.640]   racist and not for a variety of other reasons
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.080]   that they eventually did. And so the point around
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.240]   this on question of whether Bernie could have
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:53.520]   won in 2016, I don't know. Crystal seems to think
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.880]   so. I'm skeptical. Uh, I'm skeptical for a variety
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:00.120]   of reasons. I think the culture is honestly one
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.040]   of them. One of Trump's core issues in 2016 was
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.040]   immigration and Bernie and him did not agree on
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:08.600]   immigration. And if immigration, you know, even
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.960]   if people did, you know, support Bernie Sanders
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:13.120]   and his vision for working class people, like the
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.680]   debates and the understanding about what it
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:17.640]   would look like, like a healthcare system, which
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.440]   literally would pay for illegal immigrants, I
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.560]   think he would have gotten killed on that. Um,
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.560]   but I could be wrong. I honestly, I will never
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.320]   know, you know, what that looked like. Let me
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:29.200]   reference you from earlier in the conversation
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.840]   with FDR. It's not the policy. I think if he went
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:38.080]   more anti-establishment and more populist as
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.360]   opposed to trying to court, trying to be friendly
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.120]   with the DNC. Yeah. I mean, that's a good
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:48.200]   counterfactual. Nobody will really know. Look, I,
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.920]   I have a lot of love for the Bernie 2016 campaign.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:53.840]   He has a great ad from 2016 called America. You
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.920]   should watch it. It's a great ad. That's another
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.920]   very interesting thing. It's unapologetically
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:00.400]   patriotic, and that is not something that you see
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.800]   in a lot of left-wing circles these days. So he
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.520]   understood politics at a base level that a lot of
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:10.040]   people did not. Um, but you know, Bernie himself,
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:11.720]   and then a lot of the Bernie movement was
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.760]   basically crushed by the elite democratic party
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.240]   for a variety of reasons. They hated them. You
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.920]   know, they basically, they attacked Joe Rogan for
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.840]   even having him on, um, and for, uh, giving him a
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.960]   platform that was ridiculous, obviously
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.920]   backfired in their face, which is really funny.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.040]   Uh, there is a, but there were a lot of million
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.120]   examples like that, you know, when they attacked
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.880]   Bernie for, uh, endorsing a pro-life politician
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:35.920]   and he never did it again. They attacked Bernie
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:38.120]   for running, for having Bernie bros, you know,
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.240]   people online, the bros who were super bro Bernie,
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:43.880]   and it was his fault. His supporters would say
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:46.160]   nasty things about Elizabeth Warren, and he
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.880]   would like defend straight himself and be like,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.240]   yes, I'm sorry. Please. My bro is like, stop that.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.960]   I think the, his biggest problem is he never went
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:57.200]   full Trump. Like he didn't go, like he kept
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:58.040]   saying, sorry.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:00.600]   Yeah, I agree. I totally agree. And actually in
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.840]   2020, I did a ton of analysis on this at the
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.480]   time. He would always do stuff like Joe Biden,
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.840]   my friend. And it's like, no, he's not your
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.960]   friend. He stands for everything that you
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:12.520]   disagree with everything. He'd be like, yeah,
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.200]   he's a nice guy, but he's not my friend. But he
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.440]   would always be like, Joe and I are great friends,
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:19.080]   but you know, you know, we have a small
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.080]   disagreement on this, but you know, like you
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.120]   just said, in terms of going full Trump, they
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.960]   wanted to see Trump up there, humiliating all of
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:27.760]   the GOP politicians that they didn't trust
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:30.160]   anymore. That's what people really wanted. But
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.560]   the other side of this is that the Democratic
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.360]   base in 2020 was very different than 2016,
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.200]   because by 2020, they full on had TDS. And they
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:42.800]   were basically like, we need to defeat Trump at
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:45.600]   all costs. We don't give a shit what your name
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:49.920]   is, Bernie, Biden, whatever, whichever of you is
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:52.520]   going to be best defeat Trump, you get the knob.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:54.960]   2016 is different because they didn't full on
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.120]   have that, like love and necessity of winning. By
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.920]   the way, this is a strategic advantage that the
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:03.680]   Democrats have. Democrats just care about winning
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:06.120]   the current base of the party. All they want to
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:08.160]   do is win Republican base, they don't give a shit
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.200]   about winning. They just love Trump. So it's
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:14.160]   nice to win. But one of those where they will
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.360]   express their ID for what they really want. Now
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:18.760]   it's worked out for them, because it turns out
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.800]   that's a very palpable political force. But one
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:24.760]   of the reasons why, you know, you won't see me up
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.080]   here doing James Carville 40 more years is there
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.200]   is a law of something called thermostatic public
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:33.720]   opinion, where, you know, the thermostat, it
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.520]   changes a lot. Whenever you actually so when you
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.360]   have a left wing president power, the country
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.160]   goes right, we have a right wing president power,
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:42.880]   country goes left. Amazing, right? You can
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.680]   actually look at a graph of economic attitudes
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:48.520]   from the two months where Joe Biden became
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.840]   president after Donald Trump. So Republicans,
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.560]   Trump was president of the last year in office,
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.080]   economy is great. Two months later, the economy
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.800]   is horrible. That is a perfect example of
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:00.720]   thermostatic opinion. And I'm not counting these
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:03.960]   Democrats out. 2004, George W. Bush wins the
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:06.480]   popular vote. He has a historic mandate to
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.000]   continue in Iraq. By '06, he's toasted. We have a
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.680]   massive midterm election. And by '08, we're right
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:14.240]   in books about 40 more years and how there's
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:16.040]   never going to be a Republican in office ever
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.680]   again. So things can change a lot in a very short
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:19.240]   period of time.
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.200]   I think also for me personally, maybe I'm
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:25.080]   deluded. Sort of the great man view of history. I
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.760]   think some of it is in programming circles, the
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:31.800]   term skills issue. I think some of it just has to
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:34.160]   do how good you are, how charismatic you are, how
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:37.080]   good you are as a politician. I maybe disagree
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.280]   with this. I'd love to see what you think. I think
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.320]   if Obama if you were allowed to run for many
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.080]   terms, I think Obama would just keep winning. He
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:47.400]   would win 2016. He would win 2020. He would win
[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:48.640]   this year, 2024.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.960]   It's possible, but I would flip it on you. And I
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.920]   would say Obama would never be elected if there
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.800]   were no term limits. Because Bill Clinton would
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:56.240]   have still been president. Yeah.
[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:58.800]   Well, those two, right. Those two examples of
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:03.840]   exactly. They extremely skilled politicians and
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:07.360]   somehow can appear like populists.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.040]   Man, Bill Clinton was a force in his time. And
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.400]   it's honestly sad what's happened to him. I was
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.600]   actually just talking with a friend the other
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.520]   day. I'm like, I kind of don't think the
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:18.160]   president should become president when they're
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.720]   young because they live to see themselves become
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:24.040]   irrelevant. And that must be really painful
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.480]   because I know what it takes to get there. Imagine
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:30.240]   being Clinton. I mean, your entire legacy was
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.560]   destroyed with Hillary Clinton in 2016. And then
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.960]   imagine being Obama, who in 2016, you could argue
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.400]   it's a one off and say that Trump is just, oh,
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.920]   Hillary was a bad candidate. But Michelle and
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.560]   Barack Obama went so hard for Kamala Harris and
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.200]   they just got blown out in the popular vote. I
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.640]   mean, the Obama era officially ended with Donald
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.760]   Trump's reelection to the presidency in 2024. And
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.200]   that was a 20 year period where Obama was one of
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.840]   the most popular central figures in American
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:00.080]   politics. But I want to return to what you're
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.000]   saying, because it is important. And by the way,
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.960]   I do not support term limits on American
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.000]   presidents. Are you a fascist? Well, that would
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.840]   imply that would imply that I don't believe in
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.120]   democracy. I actually do believe in democracy
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.360]   because I think the people if they love their
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.560]   president should be able to reelect him. I think
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:18.160]   FDR was amazing. I think that the term limit
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:22.880]   change was a basically what happened is, is that
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.720]   Republicans and a lot of elite Democrats always
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:28.440]   wanted to speak against FDR, but he was a god so
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:31.120]   they couldn't. So they waited until he died. And
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.080]   then after he died, they were like, yeah, this
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.960]   whole third, fourth term that can never happen
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.040]   again. And America didn't really think that hard
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.320]   about it. They were like, yeah, okay, whatever.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:43.400]   But I mean, it had immense consequences for
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:46.280]   American history. Clinton is the perfect example.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:48.920]   I mean, just Bill Clinton left office, even
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:51.600]   despite the Lewinsky bullshit, he had a 60%
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:55.000]   approval rating. Okay, no way George W. Bush
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.320]   gets elected. Impossible. Clinton would have
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:00.120]   blown his ass out. And imagine the consequences
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.720]   of that. We would have no Iraq. I mean, I'm not
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.000]   saying he was a great man, like he we probably
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.400]   still would have the financial crisis. And
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:08.280]   there's still a lot of bad stuff that would have
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.240]   happened. But he was a popular dude. And, you
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.200]   know, I wouldn't say the best judgment at times
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:15.320]   presidentially, not personally, definitely not
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:17.920]   personally, but you know, presidentially, but I'm
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:20.280]   pretty confident we would have not gone into the
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:23.160]   Iraq war. And so that's where it really cost us.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:24.760]   If you're left wing and you're talking about
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.800]   Obama, yeah, I think Obama probably would have
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.960]   won in 2016. Although it's a counterfactual
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:34.360]   because Obama was never challenged in the same
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:38.080]   way that Maga was able to, to the liberal
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.840]   consensus, like Romney really ran this like,
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.040]   awful campaign, honestly, about cutting spending
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.920]   and very traditional Republican was deeply
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:50.080]   unpopular. The autopsy of that election was we
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.080]   actually need to be more pro immigration that
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.560]   literally was the autopsy. But Trump understood
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.520]   the assignment. There are two people who I so
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:01.280]   deeply respect for their political bets, Peter
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:04.320]   Thiel and Donald Trump. So one of the books that
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.440]   I recommended called The Unwinding by George
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.440]   Packer, he actually talks about Peter Thiel there.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:12.880]   This is in 2013. And Thiel talks about, he was
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.600]   like, you know, whoever runs for office next,
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:18.200]   they don't need to run on an optimistic message.
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.080]   They need to run on a message that everything is
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.720]   fucked up and that we need to fix. And if you
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.400]   think about that's why Thiel's endorsement of
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:30.320]   Trump with the American carnage message is, I
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.280]   mean, it took it was shocking, right at the
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.840]   time. But he had that fundamental insight that
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.920]   that's what the American people wanted. Trump,
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.560]   too, comes out of an election in 2012, where the
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:43.160]   literal GOP autopsy, the report produced by the
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:46.040]   party says we need to be pro mass immigration.
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:49.840]   What happens immediately after 2012, they start
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.160]   to go for mass immigrant, basically, they go for
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.680]   like these amnesty plans, the so called gang of
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:58.840]   eight plan, Marco Rubio, and all this in 2013, it
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:02.440]   falls apart. But Republicans get punished by
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:06.960]   their base in 2014. So Eric Cantor, who was the
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.160]   House Majority Leader, the number two Republican
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.480]   spent more on stake in his campaign than his
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:13.320]   primary opponent who successfully defeated him.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.800]   Guy named Dave Bratt. Dave Bratt kicked his ass
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:17.840]   on the issue of immigration and said that Eric
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.560]   Cantor is pro amnesty. All of the forces were
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.160]   there. And then in 2015, Trump comes down the
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.600]   escalator, and he gives the message on
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.880]   immigration that the GOP base has been roaring
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:30.240]   and wanting to hear now, but that nobody wanted
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:32.960]   to listen to them. And that was his fundamental
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.160]   insight. That bet was a colossal and a titanic
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:39.000]   political bet at a time when all political
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.160]   ideology and thought process would have said
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:43.800]   that you should come out on the other side, which
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:46.440]   is where a Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and all these
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.840]   other guys were effectively there. And in
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.080]   varying different ways, like they were hawkish or
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.520]   whatever, but Trump was just so had such a
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:56.920]   monopoly on that as an idea. That's why he wins
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:59.680]   the 2016 primary. And then paired with
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:02.080]   immigration, a hard line position on immigration
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:05.280]   is this American carnage idea that actually
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:08.120]   everything is wrong. The American dream is is
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.840]   has gone. You know, we will we will stop this
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:14.160]   American carnage. And I think American carnage
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.840]   is one of the most important inaugural speeches
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:18.680]   ever given in American history. It's put it up
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:21.080]   against every single other speech. There's
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.560]   nothing else like it. But that was what the
[02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:26.360]   country wanted at the time. And that's what
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.480]   great politicians are able to do is they're able
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:30.440]   to suss something out. That's also why Peter
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:34.040]   Teal is who he is, because he saw that in 2000.
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.520]   Imagine, you know what it takes to come out of
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.280]   the 2012 election to be and to be honestly
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:41.760]   totally contrarian to the entire national mood
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.440]   and this entire theory of Obama asked star
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:47.040]   politics and say, No, you need somebody who runs
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.520]   on the opposite of that to win.
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:51.440]   Well, we'll never know. And I love this kind of
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:54.520]   Mike Tyson versus Muhammad Ali. I still think I
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.800]   would have loved to see Obama versus Trump. Me
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.120]   too. I agree. And first of all, Obama versus
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:04.280]   Trump in 2008, Obama wins hands down. Well, yes,
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.480]   definitely. So this is I love how this is a
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:10.720]   boxing talk. Yeah. Now, when 2016 Obama has a
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.120]   bunch of, you know, he Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:15.720]   He's vulnerable, though. I'll tell you why.
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:17.640]   DACA. That's what nobody ever talks about in the
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:20.480]   Obama Trump thing. Don't forget, Obama takes his
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:24.640]   2012 victory basically says, Oh, the GOP even now
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:26.800]   agrees with me on immigration. And then he does
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.400]   DACA and he legalizes, you know, X million and a
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:32.200]   number of illegal immigrants who are here who
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:34.640]   are brought here as children. That also
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:36.960]   fundamentally changed the immigration consensus
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.600]   on the Republican side because they were like,
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:41.480]   Wait, holy shit, you can just do that because we
[02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:43.840]   don't agree with that at all. And that really
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:47.000]   ignited the base as well. So I'm not sure. I mean,
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:50.560]   a moment I think about a lot with Trump and just
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.400]   like being able to unleash the rage of the
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:55.320]   Republican bases. In the 2012 debate, Candy
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:57.680]   Crowley was the moderator with Mitt Romney, and
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:00.280]   she fact check him famously. This was when fact
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:03.360]   checking was shocking and impressive. And she
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:06.200]   said something about Benghazi. And she was like,
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:09.040]   No, he did say that she like, corrected Romney on
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:11.440]   behalf of Obama. To this day, it's questionable
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.000]   whether she was even right. But and Romney was
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.880]   just like, Oh, he did. Okay. Trump would have
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:18.920]   been like, excuse me, excuse me. Look at this
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.320]   woman. You know, he would have gone off. And I
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:23.960]   was like, and I think about that moment, because
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.720]   that's what the Republican base wanted to hear.
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:29.320]   But also it turns out America had a lot of
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:31.280]   festering feelings about the mainstream media
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:35.120]   that it needed unleashed. And Trump was just this
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.600]   incredible vector to just blow up this system,
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.640]   which I mean, if you asked me about optimism,
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.520]   that's the thing I'm most. Yeah, but don't you
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:45.360]   think Obama had a good sense and how to turn it
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:47.760]   on how to be anti establishment correctly, I
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:49.400]   will not deny that he's one of the most talented
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.960]   politicians literally to ever play the game. And
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:54.720]   he is, I mean, just unbelievable rhetorical
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:57.080]   talent. It look, as a counterfactual, it would
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.880]   have been more talented than Hillary. Yeah, okay.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:01.800]   No question in terms of in terms of anybody would
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.400]   have been for that one. But at the same time, all
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.760]   the signs were there all the signs for the Trump
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:11.040]   victory, and for the backlash against Obama ism
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.600]   kind of as a political project. It all existed.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.480]   You know that the T if you like I just laid the
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:19.160]   tea leaves out there from 2012 to 2015. In
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:20.800]   retrospect, it's the most predictable thing in
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:22.680]   the world that Donald Trump will get elected. But
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:24.360]   it was crazy in the moment I got to live through
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.520]   that, which was really fun, like professionally.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:31.160]   I think it's unfortunate that he kind of let
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:34.160]   Kamala Harris borrow his reputation. Oh, it's it's
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.760]   I mean, it's like, you know, better, dude, you
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:40.600]   know, you defeated these people, this Clinton
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:43.600]   machine, you destroyed them. And it was awesome
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:46.640]   in Oh, eight. What is that? Why do you what? Why
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:50.200]   did he like he's so much bigger and better than
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.240]   the machine? I don't get it. Interesting, right?
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:54.720]   It's so weird, though. I just think I think this
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:57.000]   was a wake up call. 2024 was a wake up call like
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.760]   the the DNC machine doesn't work. Absolutely. I
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.720]   mean, there needs to be new blood, new, new
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:04.040]   candidate, new Obama like candidates. Well, I'm
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:05.520]   glad you brought that up because that's important
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.400]   to in terms of the process and the way that
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:10.880]   things currently stand. The DNC actually rigged
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.440]   its entire primary system under Biden way to the
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:17.720]   not to the benefit of Obama. So, for example, you
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:19.880]   know how they moved away from the Iowa caucuses
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.320]   and they actually moved some other primaries and
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:25.760]   move the calendar to reward traditional states
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.680]   that vote much more in line with the Democratic
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:30.160]   establishment. So the story of Barack Obama is
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.160]   one that not many actually probably a lot of
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:33.920]   young people today don't even remember how it
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.960]   happened. In 2008, Obama was the underdog, right?
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.160]   And actually, here's the critical thing. Obama was
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.040]   losing with black people. Why? Black Democrats
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:44.840]   simply did not believe that white people will
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:47.720]   vote for a black guy. So Barack Obama goes to
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:50.600]   where this white state Iowa all in on the Iowa
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:53.680]   caucuses and shocks the world by winning the Iowa
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:56.920]   caucuses. Overnight, there is a shift in public
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:59.080]   opinion amongst the black population in South
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.880]   Carolina. It says, oh, shit, he actually could
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.960]   win. And it comes out and he went South Carolina.
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.160]   And that's basically was near the death knell for
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.440]   the Hillary Clinton campaign. The problem is by
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:10.920]   moving South Carolina up and by making it first,
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:13.200]   along with other more pro establishment, friendly
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.000]   places. What do we do? We make it so that Barack
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.160]   Obama could never happen again. We make it so
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:21.920]   that an older, you know, base of Democratic Party
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:25.960]   voters who listens to the elites can never have
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:28.560]   their assumptions challenged. And that's one of
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:30.840]   the worst things Joe Biden did. You know, I
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:33.080]   talked about his arrogance. He was so arrogant. He
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:35.680]   changed the freaking primary system. He was so
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:37.920]   arrogant. He refused to do a debate. I mean,
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:42.040]   imagine history. How lucky are we, honestly, that
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.280]   Joe Biden agreed to do that debate with Donald
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:48.120]   Trump early? And again, that was his arrogance. I
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:51.160]   think we're so lucky for it, because if we hadn't
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.720]   gotten it, we got to understand as a country how
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:57.560]   cooked he was and how fake everything was behind
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:00.320]   the scenes in front of all of our eyes. And they
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:02.080]   tried for three straight years to make sure that
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:05.960]   that would never happen. So, I mean, it's still
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:07.720]   such a crime, honestly, against the American
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:08.120]   people.
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:10.800]   I've been thinking about who I want to talk to for
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.480]   three hours. That's why I bring up Obama, because
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:19.960]   he's probably the number one person on the left I
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:23.040]   would like to hear analyze what happened in this
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:26.120]   election and what happened to the United States
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.840]   of America over the past 20 plus years. I can't
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.000]   imagine anybody else.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.120]   Look, if anybody could do it, it'd be you. But
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.160]   there are layers upon layers with that man. I
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:36.720]   would love to actually sit with a talk with him,
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:37.560]   for real.
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:40.760]   I think it's fair to say that we talked about the
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.880]   great man view of history. I think you have a
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:48.240]   psychopath view of history, where all great
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:50.040]   leaders are for sure psychopaths.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.760]   Not for sure. There are many who are good people.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:52.360]   Harry Truman was one.
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:53.520]   You're like, some of my best friends.
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.120]   Yeah, some-
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:54.720]   Harry Truman.
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.840]   Some, I assume, are good people. To be fair,
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:02.840]   though, most of the good ones are accidents, like
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.200]   Harry Truman. He never would've gotten himself
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.400]   elected. He was a great dude.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.600]   How do you know he was a great dude?
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:09.120]   David McCullough book. I highly recommend it.
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.640]   Everybody should read it. Truman loved his wife.
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:12.920]   I think that's really awesome. I love when
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.600]   politicians love their wife. It's so rare. He
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.120]   adored his wife. He adored his daughter, spent
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.320]   time with them. He made family life a priority.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:25.280]   He had really good small town judgment that he
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:27.560]   would apply to foreign affairs. He was just a
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.720]   very well-considered, very stand-up man. I so
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.120]   appreciate that about him. Another one is John
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.240]   Adams. I love and revere John Adams. He's my
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.600]   favorite founding father. Him and John Quincy,
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.840]   they don't get nearly enough of their due. They
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.440]   were some of the most intelligent, well-
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.680]   considered. They were family men. The love, the
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.320]   relationship between John and Abigail Adams is
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:54.160]   literally legendary. I think it's amazing,
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:56.440]   especially in the context of the 1700s, the way
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:59.520]   that he would take her counsel and into
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:03.200]   conversations and her own ability. She would sit
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:05.760]   there and go toe-to-toe as much with Thomas
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.000]   Jefferson. There are some who are great, who are
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.120]   really, really good presidents, who have good
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.320]   judgment, and who are really good people and
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.440]   really think deeply about the world and have
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:18.240]   really cool personal lives. There's also the
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.480]   vast majority of them, especially in the, I
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.440]   would say, especially in the modern era, where
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:25.720]   the price of the presidency extracts everything
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.240]   that you have. You have to be able to, you have
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.000]   to be willing to give everything. And it's just,
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.720]   that's not a price that most people want to pay.
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.240]   Is it possible that some of the people who you
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:39.760]   think are sociopaths in politics are, in fact,
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:42.440]   really good people, and some of the people you
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:45.920]   think are good, like Truman and Adams, are
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:46.880]   actually sociopaths?
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.240]   Definitely. I mean, I could just be reading the
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.240]   wrong books, right?
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:53.080]   Yeah, that's right. It sounds like you just read
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:55.000]   some really compelling biographies.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.640]   Okay, to be fair, I don't base this on one book.
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:00.320]   I read a lot of them. And I'll get like a, for
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.800]   example, I've read books about LBJ. You wouldn't
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.400]   know any of his foibles. But then you find out
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:07.120]   that they're written by his friend, or, you know,
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.800]   it was written by, and then you read the truth.
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:11.240]   I really worry about this kind of general,
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:16.320]   especially now the sense of the anti-establishment
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:19.160]   sense that every politician must be a sociopath.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:23.080]   Now, while the reason I worry about that is it
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.000]   feels true.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:25.280]   Yeah.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:31.960]   So it's, you can fall into this bubble of
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:34.400]   beliefs where every politician is a sociopath.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:36.440]   And because of that,
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:37.560]   it can be a self-reinforcing mechanism.
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:38.440]   Self-reinforcing mechanism, yeah.
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.040]   I understand what you're saying. I agree, by
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.720]   the way, we do need to dramatically change it.
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:43.920]   But the problem is, is that, you know, people
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.440]   vote with their eyeballs and with their
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:48.440]   interests, and people love to, you know, dissect
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:51.920]   people's personal lives. And one of the reasons
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.680]   why you were probably more likely in the
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:56.200]   pre-modern era to get a "good people" is they
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.320]   were not subject to the level of scrutiny and
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.680]   to the insanity of the process that you are
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:03.080]   currently. Like I just said about you, I mean,
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:05.440]   theoretically, you could run for president and
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:07.200]   you would just get your nomination at the
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.680]   convention. It's only two months to election
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:11.960]   day. That's not so bad. But, you know, you run
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:14.000]   for president today, you got your ass on the
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.800]   road for two years, two years before that. And
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.960]   then you have to run the damn government. So
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:23.480]   the price is so extraordinarily high. I also
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:26.560]   think that, oh God, and just Washington as a
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:29.200]   system, it will burn you. It will just, it will
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:32.920]   extract absolutely everything that you can give
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:35.920]   it. And at the end of the day, you know, I mean,
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:37.200]   everyone always talks about this. It's
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.960]   hilarious. How Trump is the only president not
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.600]   to age in office. I think, I actually think it's
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.640]   crazy. Like when you look at the photos of how
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.160]   he actually looks better today than he did
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.360]   whenever he went into the office. That's
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.000]   amazing. And it actually says a lot about how
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.160]   his mind works. I think Trump is pure id. Like, I
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.120]   think he's having observed him a little bit and,
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:58.880]   you know, both at the White House and having
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:00.880]   interviewed him, it's pure, just like it's
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:02.960]   calculating, but it's also pure id, which is
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.360]   very interesting. The ones who are the thinkers,
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:07.360]   guys like Obama and others who are really in
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.200]   their heads, it's a nightmare. It's a
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:11.960]   nightmare. It will, they will, I mean, I mean,
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.600]   apparently Obama would only sleep four hours a
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:14.680]   night, you know?
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:17.320]   Yeah. Add like some empathy on top of that. It's
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:17.920]   going to destroy.
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:19.280]   It will, it will kill you, man.
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:21.680]   All right. Speaking about the dirty game of
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:24.880]   politics, several people, different people told
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:27.760]   me that of everyone they've ever met in
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.640]   politics, Nancy Pelosi is the best at attaining
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:33.600]   a wielding political power. Is there any truth
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:34.080]   to that?
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.040]   In the modern era? Yeah, I think that's fair in
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:38.320]   the last 25 years. Definitely. Let's think
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.520]   about it. Number one is longevity. So she's had
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:44.040]   the ability to control the caucus for a long
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:46.040]   period of time. So that's impressive because as
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:47.800]   I just laid out with Clinton, Obama, these
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.680]   figures come and they go, but over a 25 almost
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:53.680]   year period, you've been at the very top in the
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.160]   center of American politics. The other case I
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.560]   would be is that in this modern era has been
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:00.480]   defined by access to money. She's one of the
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:02.400]   greatest fundraisers in Democratic Party
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:05.800]   history. And again, consistently Obama, Kamala,
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:08.000]   all those people come and go, but she's always
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.880]   had a very central understanding of the
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:13.640]   ability to fundraise, to cultivate good
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:15.840]   relationships with Democratic Party elites all
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:18.000]   across the country, use that money and dole it
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.320]   out to her caucus. She's also was really good at
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.560]   making sure that legislation that came to the
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:26.440]   floor actually had the votes to do so. She ran
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:29.120]   an extremely well ordered process in the House
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:32.120]   of Representatives, one in which you were able
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:34.920]   to reconcile like problems within her office. It
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.160]   didn't usually go public and then it would make
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:38.760]   it to the floor and it would pass so that there
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:42.600]   will be no general like media frenzy and you
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:45.080]   know, Democrats in disarray or any of that. Put
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:46.960]   that on display with the Republicans and we've
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:50.000]   had multiple speakers all resign or get fired in
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.320]   a 16 year period. That's pretty remarkable.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.640]   Basically, ever since John Boehner decided to
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:57.160]   leave in what was it, 2012? I forget the exact
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:00.200]   year. My point is that if you compare her record
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.640]   to the longevity on the Republican side, it is
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.880]   astounding. The other interesting thing is that
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:08.520]   she also has pulled off one of the real tests of
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:11.200]   political power is can you rule even when you
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.240]   don't have the title anymore? So she gave up the
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:16.000]   leader position to Hakeem Jeffries, but everybody
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.360]   knows she pulled Joe Biden out of the race.
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:20.720]   That's pretty interesting, right? So she's
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:23.280]   technically just a backbencher, nobody member of
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.720]   Congress, but we all know that's bullshit. So
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:28.200]   that's that's actually a very important case of
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:31.440]   political power is can you rule without the
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:33.720]   title? And if you can, then you truly are
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:36.440]   powerful. So I would make a good case for her.
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:38.640]   Yeah, she's she's done a lot of remarkable stuff
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:41.080]   for for her party. I will say they played Trump
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:43.240]   like a fiddle, man. Last time around, they were
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:46.240]   able to. I mean, they really got him. One of the
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:50.400]   craziest elements that I covered was during the
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:53.040]   Trump basically threatened to shut down the
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.400]   government and actually did shut down the
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:56.560]   government for a period of time over a dispute
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:59.720]   over border wall funding. And Pelosi and Schumer,
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:02.440]   despite like genuine mass hysteria in the
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.680]   Democratic Party, with even some people who are
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:07.480]   willing to try and to strike a deal, never
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.400]   wavered, and actually basically won and forced
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:14.840]   Trump to back down. Not a lot of MAGA people want
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:16.840]   to admit it. But that was honestly really
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:19.080]   embarrassing for the Trump administration at the
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.600]   time. And, yeah, I mean, the amount of
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.720]   discipline that it took for her and Chuck, to a
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:27.120]   lesser extent, but for the two of them to pull
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.480]   that off, it was honestly impressive that they
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:31.040]   were able to do that even when the President has
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.280]   so much political power, and it literally shut
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:34.120]   down the government over it.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:38.440]   Speaking of fundraising, Kamala raised one
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:39.480]   billion dollars.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:40.080]   Insane.
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.120]   But I guess the conclusion is she spent it
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:46.000]   poorly. How would you spend it?
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.040]   I don't think money matters that much. I think
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.240]   Donald Trump has proven to us twice that you can
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:53.960]   win an underdog campaign through earned media.
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:57.440]   And I don't think that paid advertisement moves
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:59.560]   the needle that much. Now, don't notice I didn't
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:03.880]   say it doesn't matter. But am I buying $425,000 a
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:05.880]   day spots in the Vegas sphere? No, we're not
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:09.360]   doing that. Are we building? Okay, as people who
[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:11.920]   do this for a living, how do you even spend
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:15.160]   $100,000 to build a set for one interview?
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.920]   This is the call her daddy thing. Okay, how's
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.600]   that possible? So think about the dollar per hour
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:23.080]   cost. That's like running a jet airplane in terms
[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:23.880]   of what they did.
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:26.080]   You know what I want to note behind the scenes?
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:29.760]   Haven't gotten and I'm not good with this. I get
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:32.200]   really frustrated and I shouldn't. But dealing
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:35.080]   with PR and comms people can sometimes break my
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:37.480]   soul. It's maddening. Can we not talk about this?
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:40.440]   And we need to pull them in to 12pm and you're
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:43.840]   like, but that's only 30 minutes. Yeah, that but
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:47.000]   there's stuff like, like where to put the camera.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.120]   It's not that it's not actually hypothetically,
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:52.440]   I don't even disagree with any of the suggestions
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:55.600]   or this, but it's like the micromanagement, just
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.080]   the micromanagement and your and the politeness,
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:03.000]   but the fake politeness. And it just makes me feel
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.480]   like, I think like, what would Kubrick do? Would
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:08.120]   he murder all of them right now?
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:10.760]   He would just ban them after he became Stanley
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:13.880]   Kubrick, but he dealt with it for a while. I just
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:17.720]   went on a Kubrick binge, man, he was awesome. I
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:19.440]   watched that World War One movie of his the one
[02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:23.480]   from the 50s. That is such an underrated film. I
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.040]   feel like people don't, whatever, we'll get
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.120]   past it. But she Yeah, I guess you paid for 100
[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:34.600]   grand, bro. 100 and the Oprah thing. She paid for
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.720]   the interviews. So you know, that's another one.
[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:39.160]   I do this for a living. And as you can tell, I'm
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:42.000]   very cynical person. I did not even know that
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.360]   celebrities got paid for their endorsements. I
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:47.600]   could never have imagined a universe where Oprah
[02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:50.360]   Winfrey is paid $1 million to endorse Kamala
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.120]   Harris. I'm like, you're first of all, you're a
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:54.800]   billionaire. Second, I thought you'd do this
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.720]   because you believe no, I think to be fair, I
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:01.160]   think the million just helps do the thing you
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.480]   would like to do. It's like a it's a nudge
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:05.000]   because I don't think any celebrity would
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.440]   endorse. Yeah, they're not doing it because of
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:10.640]   the money. But you should just do it for free. I
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:13.240]   can't even believe that you're doing this for
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:15.320]   money. I mean, and the fact what was it Alanis
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:17.240]   Morissette, you know how they were able they had
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:19.440]   to cut her because they didn't have the funds to
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.240]   pay her. I'm like, first of all, if you believe
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:23.560]   you should just play for free. But second, again,
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.320]   as a person who is deeply cynical, I still am
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:30.320]   genuinely shook that we are paying celebrities
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:30.880]   for their endorsement.
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:31.800]   Yeah, it's really fucked up.
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:32.560]   That's insane.
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:36.360]   Why do you think people on the left, who are
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.920]   actually in the political arena, are afraid of
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:40.920]   doing anything longer than an hour?
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:42.040]   That's a great question.
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:45.680]   So let me just say, probably most of the people
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:49.440]   I've talked to on this podcast are left wing, or
[02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:52.240]   have been for a long time. They just don't sort
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:55.640]   of out and say it. Like most scientists are left
[02:22:55.640 --> 02:23:00.360]   wing. Most sort of vaguely political people are
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:03.640]   left wing that I've talked to. But the closer
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:05.760]   you get to the actual political arena, and I've
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:11.560]   tried really hard, they just, nope. I had a bunch
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:14.440]   of people, the highest profile people say 15
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:15.760]   minutes, 20 minutes.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:18.000]   Yeah. I'm used to that. So welcome.
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:23.040]   Yeah. I just can't, you know, like, I can't
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:27.080]   imagine a conversation with Kamala or with Joe
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:31.120]   Biden, or AOC.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:31.760]   Obama.
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:36.120]   Or Obama that's of any quality at all, of any,
[02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:39.560]   shows any kind of humanity of the person, the
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:42.840]   genius of the person, the interesting nuance of
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:45.400]   the person in like 30 minutes. Like, I just
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:48.840]   can't, I can't, like, I don't know, maybe there's
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:50.640]   people that are extremely skilled that can do
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.640]   that. You just can't.
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:54.680]   You should be optimistic because a huge
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:56.800]   narrative out of this election is that the
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:23:58.960]   Democrats massively fucked up by not coming on
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:01.280]   this show or a Rogan show. So I actually
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:03.200]   fundamentally, number one, that's going to change
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:04.920]   dramatically. So be optimistic and keep
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:07.800]   pushing. But two is, this is a good segue
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:10.600]   actually, is I've been thinking a lot about, I
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:12.400]   know a lot of people listening to this show who
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:14.120]   are in tech and may have some influence on the
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:16.880]   admin. So this is kind of a, this is something
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:19.640]   I want people to take really seriously is I was
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:21.680]   a White House correspondent for the Daily
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.320]   Caller. It's a conservative outlet in Washington
[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:26.920]   during the Trump years. And the most important
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:31.160]   thing I learned from that was that under the
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:34.080]   White House Correspondents Association, the way
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:36.960]   that the media cartel has everything set up for
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:39.200]   access for press to the president is
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:43.360]   fundamentally broken, anti-American and bad for
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:46.080]   actual democracy. So let me lay this out at a
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:48.360]   very mechanical level because nobody knows this.
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:50.280]   And I was a former White House Correspondents
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:52.320]   Association member. So anybody who says I'm full
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:54.880]   of shit, I was there. For example, number one,
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:57.000]   all the seats in the briefing room, those seats
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.960]   are assigned by the White House Correspondents
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:01.760]   Association, not by the White House itself. The
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:03.800]   White House Correspondents Association requires
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.880]   you to apply for a seat, right? That adjudication
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:09.960]   process can take literally years for bylaws,
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:12.440]   elections, and all these things to do. This means
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:14.760]   that they can slow roll the entrance of new
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.400]   media, online outlets who are allowed into the
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.520]   room. The reason it really matters not having a
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:21.560]   seat is if you don't have a seat, you have to get
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:23.960]   there early and stand in the wings like I used to
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:25.800]   and raise your hand like this and just hope and
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:27.680]   pray that the press secretary can. It's
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:29.360]   extremely inconvenient. I'm talking. I have to
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:31.760]   get there hours early at a chance during a 15
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:34.640]   minute briefing. So one of the things is that
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:37.680]   Trump has is he owes a huge part of his election
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.080]   to coming on podcasts and to new media. Now,
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:43.560]   because of that, it's really important that the
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:45.760]   White House Correspondents Association, which is
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:49.400]   a literal guild cartel that keeps people out of
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:52.320]   the White House and credentials itself and
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:55.640]   creates this opaque mechanism through which they
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:58.320]   control access, you know, to asking the press
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:00.920]   secretary questions is destroyed. And there are a
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:02.960]   lot of different ways you could do this because
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.000]   the what nobody gets to is that all of these
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.280]   rules are unofficial. So for example, they're
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.000]   just traditions. The White House is like, yeah,
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.760]   it's our building, but you guys figure it out,
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:14.880]   right? Because that's a long standing tradition.
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:17.160]   Let me give you another insane tradition that
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:19.120]   currently exists in the White House. The
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.440]   Associated Press, the White Press Secretary or
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:24.840]   the Associated Press correspondent gets to start
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:26.520]   the briefing. Traditionally, they get the first
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:28.920]   question. They also get to end the briefing when
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.960]   they think it's been enough time. Like, okay,
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.440]   cringe up here. Thank you. Right. And that calls
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:36.160]   the briefing over. What? Who? You're not even the
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:37.840]   White House Correspondents Association. You
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:39.840]   literally just happen to work for the Associated
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:42.840]   Press. Why? Like, why do we allow that to happen?
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:46.440]   So number one, stop doing that. To their credit,
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:47.920]   the Trump people didn't really do that. But it's a
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:50.840]   long standing tradition. The other thing is that
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:53.640]   what nobody gets either is that the first row is
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.920]   all television networks for logistical reasons so
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:57.680]   that they can do their little stand ups with their
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:59.440]   mic and say, you know, I'm reporting live for the
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:02.840]   West. Well, what people don't seem to know is
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:05.720]   that all the television networks are basically
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:08.160]   going to ask some version of the same question.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.320]   The reason they do that is because they need a
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.720]   clip of their correspondent going after the White
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:17.000]   House press secretary all out Robert Mueller, like
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.200]   whenever I was there. So you get the same goddamn
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:23.040]   version of the stupid political questions over and
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.720]   over again. The briefing room is designed for
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:28.360]   traditional media, and they have all the access in
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.760]   the world. So in an election where you owe your
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:33.840]   victory to at least in part to new media and
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:36.760]   recognizing the changing landscape, you need to
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:40.080]   change the conduit of information to the American
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:43.480]   people. And in an election, I don't know if you
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:45.880]   saw this, but election night coverage on cable
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:50.040]   news was down 25% just in four years, 25%. That's
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:53.800]   astounding. That's cable news had a monopoly on
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:56.760]   election night for my entire lifetime. And yet my
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:59.080]   show had record ratings that night. And look, I'm
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.800]   a small slice of the puzzle here. We've got Candace
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:04.640]   Owens, Patrick, Matt, David, Tim Pool, David
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:07.240]   Pacman, TYT, all these other people, every from
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:09.080]   what I understand, all of us blew it out that
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.760]   night, because millions of Americans watching on
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:15.000]   YouTube, we even partnered with some decision
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.400]   desk HQ. So we had live data, we could make state
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:20.040]   calls. And we're just a silly little YouTube show.
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:23.160]   My point, though, is that in an election where the
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:25.880]   vast majority of Americans are the age of 55, are
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:28.000]   listening to podcasts consuming new media and are
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.600]   not watching cable news, where the median age of
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:34.880]   CNN, which is the youngest viewership is 68. 68 is
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:37.040]   the median. So statistically, what does that tell
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.600]   us? Right? There's a decent number of people who
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:45.320]   are watching CNN, who are in their 80s. And in
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.280]   their 90s. Yeah, I'm glad you brought up Alex,
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:50.440]   because he deserves a tremendous shout out Alex
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:53.200]   Bruce wits. He was the pioneer of the podcast
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.360]   strategy for the Donald J. Trump campaign. He got
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.960]   on your show, he was able to get on Andrew Schultz
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.840]   show, Rogan, he was the internal force that pushed
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:05.880]   a lot of this. My personal hope is that somebody
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:08.280]   like Alex is elevated in the traditional White
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:11.120]   House bureaucracy, that the number of credentials
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.320]   that are issued to these mainstream media outlets
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:15.880]   is cut. And there is a new lottery process put in
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.000]   place where people with large audiences are
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.760]   invited. And I also want to make a case here for
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.560]   why I think it's really important for people like
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:25.920]   you and others who don't have as much traditional
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:28.840]   media experience to come in and practice some
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:31.480]   capital J journalism, because it will sharpen you
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:34.720]   to giving you access in that pressure cooker
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:38.160]   environment. And having to, to really like sit
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:40.400]   there and spar a little bit with a public official
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.560]   and not have as long necessarily as you're used
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:45.960]   to, it really hones your news media skills, your
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:48.640]   news gathering skills, and it will make you a
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:50.720]   better interviewer in the long run. Because a lot
[02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:52.240]   of the things that I have learned have just been
[02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:55.000]   through osmosis. I've just lived in DC. I've been
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.320]   so lucky. I've had a lot of cool jobs. And I've
[02:29:57.320 --> 02:30:00.040]   just been able to experience a lot of this stuff.
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:03.040]   So I'm really hoping that people who are listening
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:05.920]   to this who may have some influence or even the
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:07.640]   viewership, if you want to, you know, reach out to
[02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:11.280]   them and all them. This is a very easily changeable
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:14.720]   problem. It's a cartel which has no official power.
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:17.240]   It's all power by tradition. And it needs to be
[02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:19.520]   blown up. It has, it does not serve America's
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:21.920]   interests to have 50, 48 seats, I think, in the
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:24.040]   White House press briefing room, which who people
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.720]   who have audiences of like five, it's just makes
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:30.200]   absolutely zero workspace seats, access
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:33.760]   credentials, and also credentials that are issued
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:37.000]   to press and to other like new media journalists
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.920]   at major events should take precedence, because
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:43.640]   it's not even about rewarding the creator. The
[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:46.600]   American people are here. You need to meet them.
[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:49.160]   That's your job. And I'll just end with a
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:52.600]   historical thing. Barack Obama shocked the White
[02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:54.840]   House Press Corps in 2009, because he took a
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:57.920]   question from the Huffington Post, a brand new
[02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:01.840]   blog, but they were stunned, because he knew he
[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:04.320]   said these blog people, they went all in for me,
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.400]   and I got to reward them. So there's long
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:08.320]   standing precedence of this. They'll bitch and
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.920]   they'll moan, they'll be upset. But it's their
[02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:12.440]   fault, you know, that they don't have as much
[02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:16.560]   credibility. And it's incumbent upon the White
[02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:18.760]   House, which serves the public to actually meet
[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:20.640]   them where they are. So I really hope that at
[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:22.760]   least some of this is implemented inside of
[02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:25.840]   that. Yeah, if you break apart the cartel, I
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:29.160]   think you can actually enable greater journalism,
[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:31.800]   frankly, with a capital J. Because actually, in
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:34.080]   the long form is when you can do better
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.400]   journalism of from even just the politician
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:39.080]   perspective, you can disagree, you can get
[02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:41.480]   criticized, because you can defend yourself. I
[02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:43.280]   had an idea, actually, tell me what you think. I
[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:45.520]   think a really cool format would be there's a
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.840]   room right near the press briefing room called
[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:49.520]   the Roosevelt Room. Beautiful room, by the
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:51.840]   way. It's awesome. It has the Medal of Honor for
[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:54.040]   Teddy Roosevelt. And it has a portrait of him
[02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:55.840]   and a portrait of FDR. It's one of my favorite
[02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:58.800]   rooms, the White House. It's so cool. And so my
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:00.600]   idea would be in the Roosevelt Room, which
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:03.080]   traditionally used for press briefings and
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:08.360]   stuff, is like, you as the press secretary sit
[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:10.120]   there, I think there's like 12 seats, something
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:12.120]   like that. And you set it all up and you have,
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:14.680]   let's say, sure microphones like this. And that
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.000]   person, that secretary is going to commit to
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.560]   being there for like two hours. And, and new
[02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:20.680]   media people like can sit around the room, all
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:22.440]   of this being stream live, by the way, just like
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:24.560]   the White House press briefing room. But the
[02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:27.640]   expectation is that the type of questions have
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:29.680]   to be substantive. Obviously, nothing is off
[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:32.320]   limits. You should never, ever, you know, except
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.480]   I'm not going to ask about this, especially as a
[02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:36.120]   journalist, you can't do that. Every time
[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:37.520]   they're like, hey, please don't ask about this.
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:38.720]   It's like, actually, that's probably the one
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:41.680]   thing you should ask about. But my point being
[02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:43.800]   that the expectation is, is that there's no
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:46.200]   interference on the White House side, but that
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:48.640]   the format itself will lend exactly to what
[02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:51.080]   you're saying to allow people to explain. And
[02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:53.760]   again, in a media era where we need to trust the
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.440]   consumer, like my show is routinely over two
[02:32:57.440 --> 02:33:01.160]   hours long on cable television, uh, on cable
[02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:03.240]   television, you know, the Tucker Carlson
[02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:05.600]   program, whenever it was on Fox news without
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:08.200]   commercial breaks was about 42, 43 minutes,
[02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.400]   something like that of runtime. So I'm speaking
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:13.560]   for almost triple what that is on a regular
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:17.120]   basis. The point is, is that millions are
[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:19.640]   willing to sit and to listen, but you just had
[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:21.680]   to meet them where they are. So I would really
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:23.840]   hope that a format like that, uh, like a
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:26.560]   streamer briefing or something like that. I
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:28.360]   think, I think it's, look, I know they would
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.800]   dunk on it endlessly, but I think it could work.
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:33.080]   Yeah. I think the incentives are different. I
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:36.800]   think it works because you don't have to, uh,
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:39.440]   like you saw good, don't have to signal to the
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:41.280]   other journalists that you're part of the clip.
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:42.800]   Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up because
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:44.680]   that was another lesson I learned. I go, Oh,
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:46.600]   none of you are asking important questions for
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:48.400]   the people you're asking questions because you
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:50.280]   all hang out with each other and you're like,
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:52.920]   Oh, wait. So this entire thing is a self
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:56.280]   reinforcing guild to impress each other, uh,
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:59.280]   at cocktail parties and not to actually ask
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:01.400]   anything interesting. Um, I remember people
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:04.840]   were so mad at me because this was 2018 or
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:08.160]   maybe 2017. And I said, do you think that Kim
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:11.720]   Jong-un is sincere in his willingness to meet
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:13.760]   with you? Something like that, to that effect.
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:16.120]   Um, they were furious cause I didn't ask about
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:18.840]   some bullshit political controversy that was
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:21.680]   happening at the time. So in the historical
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:24.360]   legacy, what was more important? The Mueller
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:29.000]   question or Donald Trump breaking 50 years or
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]   whatever of tradition with America's
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.920]   relationship with North Korea and meeting him
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:34.960]   in Singapore and basically resetting that
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:37.240]   relationship for all time. As you can tell, I
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:39.120]   read a lot of book. I like to take the long
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:41.000]   view. Every time I would ask a question, I go,
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.800]   okay, when, when the future Robert Caro is
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:47.600]   writing books and he, he sees, he's reading the
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:49.160]   transcript of the White House press briefing.
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:50.880]   You don't even know who this kid is. He goes,
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:52.240]   Oh, that was a pretty good question right there.
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:54.840]   That's pretty relevant. You know, you got to
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:56.400]   think about all the bullshit that gets left on
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.120]   the cutting room floor.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.640]   I love that view of journalism. Actually. The,
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:02.680]   the, the goal is to end up as, as one line at a
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:04.040]   history in a history book.
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:06.760]   I just want a quote of what the president said
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:08.440]   to something that I asked in a book. That's, I
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:10.520]   would be happy. I would die happy with that. If
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:11.840]   you told me that when I'm like a 90 year old
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:14.320]   man, I'd be like, man, I, that means I succeeded.
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:18.120]   When the AI is right, the history of human
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:21.600]   civilization. One of the things I continuously
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:23.920]   learn from you when looking back through history
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:29.080]   is how crazy American politics has been
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:30.400]   throughout history. It makes me feel a lot
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:31.760]   better about the current day. It should.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:36.760]   Corruption. Yes. Um, just the, the divisiveness
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:42.600]   also stealing elections at all levels of
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:45.520]   government and direct stealing and indirect
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:48.000]   stealing all kinds of stuff. So, uh, is there
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.760]   stuff that jumps out to mine throughout history?
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:55.080]   That's just like, uh, um, the craziest
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:58.680]   corruptions or stealing of elections that, uh,
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:35:59.240]   come to mind.
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:01.160]   I'll give you the micro and the macro. So my
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:03.920]   favorite example is, uh, Robert Caro, who I've
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:05.480]   obviously probably talked about him a lot. Uh,
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:07.560]   God bless you, Robert. I hope you live to write
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:09.400]   your last book because we really need that from
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:14.200]   you. Um, but Robert, uh, came to Texas. He only
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:17.040]   intended on writing three books about Lyndon
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:19.720]   Johnson. He's currently completed four and he's
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:21.520]   on his fifth and it's taken him over 40 years to
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:23.560]   write those. And one of the reasons is he just
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.560]   kept uncovering so much stuff. And one of them
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:29.880]   is book two means of ascent. He never intended
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:32.480]   to write it, but as he began to investigate
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:35.880]   Lyndon Johnson's 1948 Senate election, he
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:39.360]   realizes in real time how rigged and stolen it
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.520]   was. And so I often tell people, what if I told
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:46.480]   you that we lived in the most secure election
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:49.320]   period in modern history, they wouldn't believe
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:52.000]   it. But if you read through that shit, I'm
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.040]   talking about bags of cash, millions of dollars,
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:58.360]   literal stuffed ballot boxes. It's great to be
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:00.680]   back here in Texas because I always think about
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:03.920]   that place like down in Zapata and star County.
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:07.120]   I'm talking like basically Mexico, um, where
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:10.960]   these dawns were in power in the 1940s and they
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:13.240]   would literally stuff the ballot boxes with the
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:14.760]   rolls and they wouldn't even allow people to
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.880]   come and vote. They just checkmarked it all for
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.000]   you based upon the amount they paid. Means of
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000]   ascent is the painstaking detail of exactly how
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.640]   Lyndon Johnson stole the 1948 Senate election.
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:29.840]   And so nothing, nothing like that, as far as I
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:32.760]   know, is still happening. Macro. Uh, we can talk
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:36.240]   about the 1876, uh, election Rutherford B Hayes,
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:38.720]   one of the closest elections in modern history.
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:40.600]   It was one of those that got kicked with House
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:43.000]   of Representatives. That was an insane, insane
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.560]   time. The corrupt bargain that was struck to
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.840]   basically end reconstruction and federal
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.840]   occupation of the South. And of course, the
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:52.200]   amount of wheeling and dealing that happened
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:55.360]   in inside of that was absolutely bonkers and
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:57.520]   nuts. That was what an actual stolen election
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:00.240]   looks like. Just so people know. Uh, so on a
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:02.760]   micro and a macro, yeah, that's what it really
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:05.280]   looks like. Uh, and so look, I understand where
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:07.560]   people are coming from. Also, let's do what
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:11.080]   1960, that was pretty wild. I mean, uh, in 1960,
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:13.800]   there was all those allegations about Illinois
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:16.120]   going for Kennedy. Um, if you look at the actual
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:19.200]   vote totals of Kennedy Nixon, wow. I mean, it's
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.240]   such an insanely close presidential election.
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:24.480]   And even though the electoral college victory
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:26.720]   looks a little bit differently, Nixon would
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:28.920]   openly talk about, he's like, Oh, old Joe
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:32.440]   Kennedy, uh, rigged Illinois for his boy. And
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:33.960]   he'd be like, and we didn't even have a chance
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:36.160]   in Texas with Linden pulling, you know, like
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:39.640]   Linden or Linden stuffing the ballot boxes down
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.480]   there. So, and this is open on the, like they
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:44.760]   openly admit this stuff. They talk about it. So,
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:49.480]   uh, actually there's a funny story. Uh, LBJ lost
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:54.400]   is, uh, I think it's 1941 Senate primary. Um, and
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:57.240]   it's because the, his opponent Papio Daniel
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:00.200]   actually outstole Linden. So they were both
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:03.080]   corrupt, but Papio Daniel stuffed the ballot box
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:05.760]   and like the fifth day of the seven days to
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:10.040]   count the votes and FDR loved LBJ. And, uh, it's
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.520]   interesting, right? Uh, the FDR recognized
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:16.000]   Johnson's, uh, his talent and he goes, Linden,
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.560]   you, you know, in New York, we sit on the ballot
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:21.880]   boxes till we count them, you know, cause he's
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:23.720]   admitting that he, you know, you know,
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.240]   participated in a lot of this stuff. So this
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:29.120]   high level chicanery of stolen elections is
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:31.840]   actually, uh, an American pastime that we
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:35.360]   luckily have moved on from. Um, and, and quite a
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:37.960]   lot of people do not know the exact intricate
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:39.920]   details of how wild it was back in the day.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:42.320]   Yeah. It's actually one of the things it's
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.440]   harder to pull off a bunch of bullshit with all
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:47.120]   these cameras everywhere now. Transparency to
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:49.360]   lack of cash banking regulation is a variety of
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:51.760]   reasons, but yeah. So that said, let's talk
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:54.440]   about the 2020 election. It seems like forever
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.360]   ago. Do you think it was rigged the way that
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.240]   Trump claimed? No. And was it rigged in other
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:04.640]   ways? Look, this is the problem with language
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:06.800]   like rigged. And by the way, when I interviewed
[02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:08.680]   Vivek Ramaswamy, he said the exact same thing.
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:10.280]   So for all the MAGA people who are going to
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:13.240]   get mad at me, uh, Vivek agrees. All right. And
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:18.600]   if, okay. I, I, I have observed, and I'm going
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:21.520]   to put my analyst hat on. There are two theories
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:24.360]   of stop the steal. One I call low IQ, stop the
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:26.760]   steal. And when I call high IQ, stop the steal
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:29.840]   low IQ, stop the steal is basically what Donald
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:32.200]   Trump has advocated, uh, where, you know,
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:35.800]   Dominion voting machines and bamboo ballots and
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:38.600]   Venezuela and Sidney Powell and all the people
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:40.480]   involved basically got indicted by the state of
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:41.960]   Georgia. I'm not saying that that was correct.
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:43.720]   I'm just like, that's what that actually looked
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.600]   like. Rudy Giuliani, et cetera. High IQ stop the
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:50.400]   steal is basically, and actually, I mean, these
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:53.320]   are not illegitimate arguments. The school of
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:57.040]   thought is it was illegitimate for the state of
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:00.040]   Pennsylvania and other swing States to change
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:03.560]   mail-in balloting laws as a response to COVID,
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:06.240]   which enabled millions of people more to vote
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:08.080]   that wouldn't have. And that those change in
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.200]   regulations became enough to swing the election.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.600]   I actually think that that is true. Now, would
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.920]   you say that that's rigged? That's a very
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:17.720]   important question because we're talking about a
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:19.600]   Republican state legislature and Republican
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:21.920]   state Supreme court, right? The two that actually
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:23.960]   ruled on this question. So could you say that it
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:26.720]   was rigged by the Democrats to do that? Another
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:29.520]   problem with that theory is that while you can
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:32.040]   say that that's unfair to change the rules last
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.680]   time around, you can also understand it to a
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:36.400]   certain extent. And I'm not justifying it. I'm
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.120]   just giving you an example. So for example, after
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:42.720]   her, the hurricane hit North Carolina, Republican
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:45.320]   officials were like, Hey, we need to make sure
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:47.600]   that these people who had Western North Carolina
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.520]   who were affected by the hurricane could still
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:51.720]   be able to have access to the ballot box. And
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:53.320]   people were like, Oh, so you're saying in an
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:54.880]   extraordinary circumstance that you should
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:56.600]   change voting, right? You know, access and
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:58.840]   regularity to make sure that people have access.
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:01.920]   So my point is, you can see the logic through
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:05.600]   which this happened. And the high IQ version is
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:08.920]   basically the one that was adopted by Josh Holly
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:11.600]   whenever he voted against certification. He said
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:14.560]   that the state Pennsylvania, particularly
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:16.600]   election law, and that those changes were
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:19.240]   unfair and led to the quote unquote, rigging of
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:21.480]   the election against Donald Trump. Now there's
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:24.280]   an even higher IQ galaxy brain stopped the steal
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:27.520]   galaxy brain stopped the steal is one that you
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:30.120]   saw with great love and respect my friend JD
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:34.400]   Vance, uh, at his debate with Tim Walz, when Tim
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:36.440]   Walz asked him, what did he say? He said, he
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:38.400]   said, did Donald Trump win the 2020 election?
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:40.800]   He's like, Tim, I'm focused on the future. And
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:43.680]   then he started talking about censorship, the
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:46.360]   hunter Biden laptop story. Uh, if you take a
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.960]   look at the Joe Rogan interview, Rogan actually
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:50.560]   asked JD this, he's like, what do you mean you
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.720]   in the election was some version of that. And
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:55.120]   JD was like, well, what I get really frustrated
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:57.760]   by is people will bring up all these insane
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:00.120]   conspiracy theories, but they ignore that the
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:03.320]   media censored the hunter Biden laptop story and
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:06.720]   that big tech had its finger on the thumb for
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:08.880]   the Democrats. Now that is empirically true.
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:11.720]   Okay. That is true. Right now. Would you say
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:14.000]   that that's rigged? I'm not going to use that
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:15.720]   word. Cause that's a very different word. Now
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:17.680]   would you say that that's unfair? Yeah. I think
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:20.880]   it's unfair. Um, so there's another, there's a
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:23.800]   lot of MAGA folks, uh, picked up on this one.
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:26.040]   There was a time magazine article in 2020.
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:28.000]   That's very famous in their crowd called, you
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.520]   know, the, the, it was like the fight to
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.280]   fortify the election. And it was about all of
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:34.880]   these institutions that put their fingers on the
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.880]   scale for Joe Biden against Donald Trump. So I
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:41.480]   will put it this way. Was Donald Trump up
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:45.600]   against the Titanic forces of billionaires, tech
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:49.680]   censorship, and elite institutions who all did
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:53.720]   absolute damnedest to defeat him in 2020. Yes,
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:57.840]   that is true. And in a sense, the galaxy brain
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.640]   case is the only one of those, which I think is
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:04.000]   truly legitimate. And I'm not going to put it
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.800]   off the table, but this is the problem. That's
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:10.480]   not what Trump means. You know, Trump, Trump,
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:12.040]   by the way, will never tell you what I just
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:15.240]   told you, right? JD will. If you go, when you
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:18.640]   ask any of these Republican politicians, when
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:20.000]   they're challenged on it and they don't want to
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.720]   say that Trump, a loss of 2020 election, they'll
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:25.600]   give the galaxy brain case that I just gave. And
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.000]   again, I don't think it's wrong, but it's like
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.680]   guys, that's not what he means when he says it.
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:33.120]   And that's the important parsing of the case.
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:35.560]   Right? So first at a high level, Trump or
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:37.480]   otherwise, I don't like anyone who whines when
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:39.840]   they lose period. Yeah. Although he did tell you
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:41.960]   he lost, you'd notice that that's the only time
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:44.360]   he's ever said it ever. You're famous here in
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:46.600]   history for that one. Lost by a whisker. Yeah.
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:50.960]   Lost by a whisker. I mean, there is a case to
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:54.280]   be made that he was joking. I don't know. But
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:56.240]   there is a kind of weaving that he does with
[02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:58.360]   humor, where sometimes it's sarcasm, sometimes
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:02.480]   not. Much easier to showcase in a three hour
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:05.000]   interview, I'll say. Good call. Go ahead. I
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000]   couldn't even like play with that when you have
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.320]   40 minutes. I know. You're like, you know, I
[02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:14.000]   could do just 40 minutes on weaving alone. For
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.200]   your style, it doesn't work. And I can tell you
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.000]   how the way I interview politicians is I just do
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.440]   pure policy. So when I the first time I
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.520]   interviewed Trump, I compiled a list of 15
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:26.120]   subjects, me and my editor, Vince, calling a
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:28.520]   shout out to Vince, and the two of us sat in an
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:31.160]   office. And then we had questions by priority in
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:33.000]   each category. And if we felt like we're running
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.480]   short on time, we would move around those
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:37.280]   different ones. But that was purely he's the
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:39.120]   president, we're asking him for his opinions on
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:41.400]   an immigration bill or whatever. For what you
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:43.560]   do, it's impossible to do. Yeah, I just want to
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:48.360]   say that. Thank you for everybody involved for
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:49.960]   making my conversation with Donald Trump
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:52.600]   possible. But I've learned a lot from that, that
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:56.560]   I just if if I'm told that all I have is 40
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.560]   minutes, I'm very politely sparing. In that case,
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:03.520]   Donald Trump, the 40 minutes and just walking
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:05.720]   away, because I don't think I can do a good job.
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:07.480]   I think that is the correct decision on your
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:10.440]   part. Yeah. And I also would encourage you to
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:13.200]   have the confidence at this point, that you are
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:16.200]   in a position of something that we call in the
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:18.480]   business, the ability to compel the interview.
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:21.800]   And by to compel means to be able to bring
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:23.720]   somebody else to you and not the other way
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:27.080]   around. And I think that you and Rogan and a few
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:29.480]   others are in that very unique position. And I
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:31.800]   would really encourage you guys to stick to your
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:34.120]   guns on things that make you feel comfortable.
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:36.800]   Because, you know, those of us in news, we will
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.880]   always negotiate, we'll always we're willing to
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:40.600]   do short form because we're asking about policy.
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:43.160]   But for the style that you help popularize, and I
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:45.200]   think that you're uniquely talented and good at
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.520]   that's very important not to compromise on. So
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:49.480]   thank you for saying those words. And that's not
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:51.400]   just in the interest of journalism in the interest
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:53.800]   of conversation is the interest of the guests as
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:55.640]   well. Yeah, absolutely. Bring out the best in
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:57.600]   them. Yeah, I mean, I would feel really at a
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:00.000]   disservice. And I would feel like people would
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.960]   not get a unique understanding of like my own
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:05.080]   thought process and my backstory if I was not
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:07.520]   able to sit here for literally hours and to
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:11.080]   explain in deep detail like how I think about the
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:13.000]   world, not that anyone cares that much. But you
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:16.040]   know, it's just like, I hope all I can do is I
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.120]   hope it's helpful. I want to help people think.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:21.120]   Because when I was growing, I was growing up not
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:23.560]   far from here, 90 minutes from here, and College
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:26.600]   Station, I felt very uniquely closed off from the
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:29.480]   world. And I found the world through books and
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:32.520]   books saved my life. They many, so many different
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:35.080]   times. And I hope to encourage that in other
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:38.000]   people. I really, no matter where you are, no
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.040]   matter who you are, no matter how busy you are,
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:42.720]   you have some time to either sit down with a book
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:45.480]   or put on an audio book, and you can transport
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:47.920]   yourself into a different world. It's so
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:50.040]   important. And that's something that your, your
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:52.120]   show really helps me with too. I love listening
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:53.720]   to your show whenever sometimes when I'm too
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:55.400]   into politics, I need to listen to something. I'll
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:58.080]   listen to that Mayan historian guy. I love stuff
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:58.520]   like that.
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:01.800]   I've been a deep dove on Genghis Khan, reading
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:04.600]   Genghis Khan and then making the modern world.
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:05.680]   Yeah, Jack Weatherford.
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:07.120]   Yeah, he's coming on.
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:07.920]   Is he?
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:08.640]   Yeah.
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:09.240]   Amazing.
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:11.360]   And again, shout out to Dan Carlin.
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:15.360]   The GOAT, the OG. Dan, I've never met you before.
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:17.520]   I would love to correspond at some point. I love
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.000]   you so much. You changed my life, man.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.560]   I met him once before. And it felt-
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:22.640]   I listened to your interview with him.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:26.520]   I was starstruck. Very, very starstruck. And his,
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:28.600]   I mean, just so much. Painful Attainment. I've
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:29.240]   listened to that many times.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:31.000]   I think his best series, one of his best series,
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.120]   it gets no credit for, Ghosts of the Osferon.
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:35.640]   Nobody gives him credit for that one. That's OG.
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:40.200]   This is a 2011 series. But his Ghosts of the Osferon
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.520]   on the Eastern front of the Nazi war against
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:46.240]   Russia fundamentally changed my view of warfare
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.280]   forever. And also, at that time, I was very young.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:52.120]   And to me, World War II was Saving Private Ryan.
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:55.400]   I wasn't as well-read as I am now. And I was like,
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:58.080]   "Oh, shit. This entire thing happened, which
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:48:59.920]   actually decided the Second World War. And I
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:02.960]   don't know anything about this." So shout out to
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:04.200]   Dan. God bless you, man.
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:09.280]   And his "short episodes," I think, on slavery in
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:10.400]   general throughout human history.
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:12.760]   That was an awesome episode. I actually bought a
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:14.520]   bunch of Hugh Thomas books because of that
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:17.000]   episode. I'd never really read about African
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.760]   slavery or the slave trade outside of the civil
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:21.680]   war context. So again, shout out to him for that
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:23.600]   one. That was an amazing episode. His Japan
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.640]   series, too. I'm going to Japan in a few days. And
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:28.760]   I keep thinking of what he always talked about in
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:31.360]   his Supernova in the East. The Japanese are like
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:35.360]   everyone else, but only more so. And God, I love
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:35.840]   that quote.
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:40.720]   Okay, he's great. And we, ironically, arrived at
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:43.520]   this tangent while talking about the 2020
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:43.880]   election.
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:46.760]   That's why podcasting is fun.
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:49.920]   Because you said, "Lost by a whisker." And now
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:55.600]   we're dragging a screaming back to the topic. One
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:01.200]   of the things I was bothered by is Trump claiming
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:04.360]   that there's widespread, as you're saying, low IQ
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:07.720]   theory, the widespread voter fraud. And I saw no
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:12.960]   evidence of that that he provided. And all right,
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:15.200]   well, let's put that on the table. And then the
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:18.040]   other thing I was troubled by, that maybe you can
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:22.440]   comfort me in the context of history, how easily
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:28.160]   the base ate that up. That they were able to
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:31.760]   believe the election was truly rigged, based on no
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:34.880]   clear evidence that I saw. And they just love the
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:37.320]   story. And there is something compelling to the
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:40.600]   story that, you know, like this DNC type, like
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:43.480]   with Bernie, the establishment just, they're
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:48.360]   corrupt and they steal the will of the people. And
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:54.360]   like, the lack of desire from the base or from
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:57.120]   people to see any evidence of that, what's really
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:57.760]   troubled me.
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:50:59.720]   Yeah. I'm going to give you one of the most
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:02.680]   depressing quotes, which is deeply true. Roger
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:05.560]   Ailes, who is a genius. Shout out to The Loudest
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:07.480]   Voice in the Room by Gabriel Sherman. That book
[02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:09.760]   changed my life too, because it really made me
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:11.800]   understand media. People don't want to be
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:14.880]   informed. They want to feel informed. That is one
[02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:17.360]   of the most fundamental media insights of all
[02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:17.680]   time.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:18.400]   What a line.
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:22.160]   Roger Ailes, a genius, a genius in his own right,
[02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:25.160]   who, you know, he changed the world. He certainly
[02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:29.200]   did. He, you know, he's the one who kind of gets
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:31.320]   credit for one of the greatest debate lines of
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:33.440]   all time, because he was an advisor to President
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:36.280]   Reagan. Whenever he broke in, he was like, Mr.
[02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:37.720]   President, people want to know if you're too damn
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:40.000]   old for this job or not. And he inspired that
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:43.400]   joke that Reagan made, where he was like, I will
[02:51:43.400 --> 02:51:46.160]   not use age in this campaign. I will not hold my
[02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:48.440]   opponent's youth and inexperience against him.
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:51.360]   That was Ailes, man. You got, he did the Nixon
[02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:55.160]   town halls. He did it all. He's a fucking genius.
[02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:57.920]   And I'm not advocating necessarily for the world
[02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:01.120]   he created for us, but he did it. And people
[02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:02.560]   should study him more. If you're interested in
[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:04.800]   media in particular, that book is one of the most
[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:05.880]   important books you'll ever read.
[02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:08.280]   Yeah, you know what, that quote just really
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:11.880]   connected with me, because, you know, there's all
[02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:15.560]   this talk about truth. And I think what people
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:18.280]   want to, they want to feel like they're in
[02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:19.200]   possession of the truth.
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:19.640]   Correct.
[02:52:19.800 --> 02:52:21.920]   Not actually be in the possession of the truth.
[02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:25.360]   Yeah, I know. It's one of the, it hit me too.
[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:27.840]   Actually, Russell Crowe does an amazing job of
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:30.400]   delivering that line in the Showtime miniseries.
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:32.840]   So if you have the chance, you should watch it.
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:35.400]   And look, this is the problem. Liberals will be
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:37.200]   like, yeah, see these idiot Republicans. I'm
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:39.080]   like, yeah, you guys have bought a lot of crazy
[02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:41.240]   stupid shit too. Okay. And if actually, I would
[02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:43.200]   say liberal misinformation, quote unquote, is
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:45.600]   worse than Republican disinformation because it
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:48.880]   pervades the entire elite media like Russiagate
[02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:51.280]   or Cambridge Analytica or any of these other
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:54.600]   hoaxes that have been foisted on the American
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:57.400]   people. The people who listen to the Daily and
[02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:00.200]   from the New York Times are just as brainwashed,
[02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:04.160]   lack of informed, want to feel informed as people
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:06.840]   who watch Fox News. So let me just say that out
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:09.560]   there. It's an equal opportunity cancer in the
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:09.960]   American.
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:11.840]   Actually, we started early on in the
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:16.840]   conversation talking about bubbles. What's your
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:20.640]   advice about how to figure out if you're in a
[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:21.920]   bubble and how to get out of it?
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:24.960]   That's such a fantastic question. Unfortunately,
[02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:26.920]   I think it comes really naturally to someone
[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:29.360]   like me because I'm the child of immigrants and
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:31.760]   I was raised in College Station, Texas. So I was
[02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:34.320]   always on the outside. And when you're on the
[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:37.080]   outside, this isn't a sob story. It's a deeply
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:39.480]   useful skill because when you're on the outside,
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:41.600]   you're forced to kind of observe. And you're
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:44.240]   like, oh. So like when I was raised was the
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:47.920]   Bible belt and people really, you know, people
[02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:50.560]   were hardcore evangelical Christians and I could
[02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:51.840]   tell them like, oh, they really believe this
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:54.040]   stuff. And, you know, they were always trying to
[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:56.960]   proselytize and all of that. And then the other
[02:53:56.960 --> 02:53:59.280]   gift that my parents gave me is I got to travel
[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:02.000]   the entire world. I probably visited 25, 30
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.880]   countries by the time I was 18. And one of the
[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:08.960]   things that that gave me was the ability to just
[02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:11.600]   put yourself in the brain of another person. So
[02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:13.120]   one of the reasons I'm really excited to go to
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:15.800]   Japan and I picked it as a spot for my honeymoon
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:19.720]   was because Japan is a first world developed
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:22.160]   country where the vast majority of them don't
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:25.080]   speak English. It's distinguish, distinguishly
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:28.200]   non-Western and they just do shit their own way.
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:30.520]   So they have a subway, but it's not the same as
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:32.640]   ours. They have restaurants. Things don't work
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:35.120]   the same way. They have, you know, I could go to
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:37.680]   a laundry list, their entire philosophy of life,
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:41.800]   of the daily rhythm, even though it merges with
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:44.320]   service-based managerial capitalism and they're
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:47.640]   fucking good at it too. They do it their own way.
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:50.880]   So exposure to other countries in the world gave
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:53.440]   me, and also just being an outsider myself, gave
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:56.080]   me a more detached view of the world. So if you
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:58.240]   don't have that, what I would encourage you is
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:01.640]   to flex that muscle. So go somewhere that makes
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:04.040]   you uncomfortable. This will be a very boomer
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.200]   take, but I hate the fact that you have 5G
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.920]   everywhere you go in the world, because some of
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:11.440]   the best experiences I've ever had in my life is
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:14.600]   walking around Warsaw, Poland, trying to find a
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:17.480]   bus station to get my ass to Lithuania with a
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:20.040]   printed out bus ticket. I have no idea where the
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.280]   street is. I'm in a country where not that many
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:24.200]   people speak English. We're pointing and
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:27.080]   gesturing, right? And I figured it out. And it
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:28.440]   was really easy. I got to meet a lot of cool
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:30.800]   Polish people. Same in Thailand. I've been in
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:33.720]   rural like Bumbuk, Thailand, Columbia, places
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:37.080]   where people speak zero English. And your
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:41.080]   ability to gesture and use Pidgin really connects
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:44.640]   you and gives you like the ability to to get an
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:47.680]   exposure to others. And so I know this is a very
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:50.760]   like wanderlust, like travel thing. But
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:52.840]   unironically, if you're raised in a bubble,
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:55.080]   pierce it. Like that's the answer is seek
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:57.600]   something out that makes you uncomfortable. So
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:59.280]   if you're raised rich, you need to go spend some
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:01.160]   time with poor people and consider that they
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:03.560]   might actually understand the world better than
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:05.840]   you. Well, in some respects. So I think a lot of
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:07.240]   rich people have really screwed up personal
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:09.320]   lives. So if you're poor and you really value
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:11.720]   family, you say, oh, that's interesting. There
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:13.880]   seems to be a fundamental tradeoff between
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:16.360]   extraordinary wealth and something that I value.
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:19.520]   But what can I take away from that person? Oh,
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:22.680]   put my money in index funds. Make sure that I
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:24.760]   am conscientious about my budgeting and
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:29.680]   common-sense shit, right? And vice versa. People
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:32.480]   who are very wealthy get so caught up in the rat
[02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:35.480]   race about their kids going to private school and
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:38.000]   all of this. And then, you know, they very rarely
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.960]   engage with there's that famous study where they
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:41.880]   ask people on their deathbed, like what they
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:43.720]   valued in life. And every single one of them was
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:44.840]   like, I wish I'd spend more time with my
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:47.680]   children. I think about that every time that I
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:49.880]   am thinking about pursuing a new work endeavor
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:51.840]   or something that's going to have me spend
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:55.240]   significant time away from my wife. And I'm
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:58.400]   almost always these days now that I've achieved
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:01.360]   a certain level of success. The answer is I'm
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:03.680]   not doing it unless you can come with me.
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:05.320]   One of the bubbles I'm really concerned about
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:08.160]   the San Francisco bubble. I visit there recently
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:11.760]   because there's so many friends there, uh, that I
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.040]   respect deeply. So many brilliant people in San
[02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:19.160]   Francisco, the Silicon Valley, but there's just
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:23.200]   this, um, I don't even want to criticize it, but
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:26.040]   there's definitely a bubble. Yeah, that thought
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:29.200]   I'm with you. I'm friends with some SP Silicon
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:32.120]   Valley people as well. I'm similarly struck by
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:35.800]   that, uh, every time I go. And honestly, I do
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:39.680]   admire them because they, what I respect the most
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:41.480]   amongst entrepreneurs, business and political
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:43.720]   thinkers is systems thinking. Nobody thinks
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:45.760]   systems better than people who are in tech
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:48.400]   because they deal with global shit, right? Not
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:49.800]   even just America. They have to think about the
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:52.280]   whole world, about the human being and his
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:55.040]   relationship to technology and coding in some
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.280]   ways is an expression of the human mind and
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:57:59.000]   about how that person wants to achieve this
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.840]   thing. And Hey, you mechanically can type that
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:04.360]   into a keyboard or even code something to code
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:06.600]   for you to be able to achieve that. That's a
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:10.040]   remarkable accomplishment. I do think those
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:12.880]   people and people like that too, who think very
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:16.320]   linearly through math and their, their geniuses
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:18.440]   are the ones who can take their creativity and
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:21.520]   merge it with linear thinking. But I do think
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:23.520]   that that actually, those are the people who
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:27.080]   probably most need to get out of the bubble,
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:30.000]   check themselves a little bit and look, it's
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.040]   really hard, you know, once you achieve a
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:34.600]   certain level of economic success and others,
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:36.720]   like what do most rich people do? They closed
[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:38.720]   himself off from the world, right? That's the
[02:58:38.720 --> 02:58:40.440]   vast majority of the time. What do you do?
[02:58:40.440 --> 02:58:42.760]   Economy is annoying flying. They fly first
[02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:45.680]   class. Living in a small house is annoying.
[02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:48.200]   They buy a bigger house. Dealing with a lot of
[02:58:48.200 --> 02:58:49.960]   these inconveniences of life is annoying. You
[02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:51.240]   pay a little bit more to make sure you don't
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:53.840]   have to do that. There's a deep insidious thing
[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:55.600]   within that each one of those individual
[02:58:55.600 --> 02:58:58.480]   choices, where the more and more removed that
[02:58:58.480 --> 02:59:00.280]   you get from that, the more in the bubble that
[02:59:00.280 --> 02:59:01.800]   you are. So you should actually seek out those
[02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:05.200]   experiences or create them in a concerted way.
[02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:12.200]   Speaking of bubbles, Sam Harris. Oh, uh, he has
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:14.440]   continued to criticize me directly and
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:18.440]   indirectly, I think unfairly, but I love Sam. I
[02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:21.280]   deeply respect him. Everybody should listen to
[02:59:21.280 --> 02:59:23.160]   the making sense podcast. It always makes me
[02:59:23.160 --> 02:59:26.560]   think, uh, it's definitely in the rotation for
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:28.800]   me. That's a, that's very admirable of you. I
[02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:33.520]   mean, he's, I think one of the sharpest minds
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:36.920]   of our generation. And for a long time I looked
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:39.160]   up to him as one of the weird moments for me to
[02:59:39.160 --> 02:59:41.920]   meet him. Cause you listened to somebody for
[02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:45.080]   such a long time. I feel that way with you. I'm
[02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:48.520]   serious. Yeah, it was, it's a beautiful moment.
[02:59:48.520 --> 02:59:50.640]   I mean, same with Joe and stuff like this. It's,
[02:59:50.640 --> 02:59:52.560]   it's, it's, it is one of the most surreal
[02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:55.040]   moments of your life, uh, to be able to meet
[02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:57.640]   somebody who you spend like hours listening to.
[02:59:57.640 --> 02:59:59.480]   I actually think about that when people come up
[02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:01.320]   to me. Cause I'm like, oh, they're feeling what
[03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:04.480]   I felt whenever I, yeah. Yeah. And you have to
[03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:07.640]   like, you see it, you feel it and you have to
[03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:09.600]   celebrate that because there is an intimacy to
[03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:14.200]   it. Um, I think it's real that people really do
[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:17.240]   form a real connection, a real friendship. It
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:18.960]   happens to be one way, but I think it actually
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:22.560]   can, um, upgrade to a two way pretty easily. It
[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:24.600]   happens with me like in a matter of like five
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:26.200]   minutes when I meet somebody at an airport or
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:29.640]   something like that. Anyway, uh, Sam took a
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:32.880]   pretty strong position on Trump and has for a
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:36.920]   long time. Yeah. He has been consistent and
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:42.000]   unwavering. So he, he thinks that Trump is a
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:46.400]   truly dangerous person for democracy, for maybe
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:48.960]   for the world. Um, can you still man his
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:49.440]   position?
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:52.600]   Well, see, I think a lot of this podcast has
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:54.760]   been stealing, manning it because Sam is a big
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:58.080]   character matters guy. Like he focuses a lot on
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:00.240]   Trump's personality. By the way, I'm like you,
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:01.920]   I've listened to Sam Harris for years. I bought
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:04.360]   his meditation app. So nobody's going to accuse
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:06.440]   me of being some Sam Harris hater. I listened
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:09.480]   to him for way before, long before even Donald
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:11.920]   Trump was elected. That's how far back I go
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:14.520]   with the Sam Harris podcast. I have a lot of
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:16.920]   respect for the dude. I, I enjoy a lot of his
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:19.760]   older interviews. I do think after Trump, he
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:22.360]   did succumb a little bit, in my opinion, to the
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:26.320]   elite liberalism view, both of the impetus behind
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:28.880]   Donald Trump and why he was able to be
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:31.400]   successful. So in some ways, very denigrating to
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:34.000]   the Trump voter, but also a fundamental
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:35.920]   misunderstanding of the American presidency.
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:38.360]   Because like I said, he really is the one who
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:40.520]   believes that that narcissism, that character
[03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:42.880]   and all of that, that makes Trump tick itself
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:45.480]   will eventually override any potential benefit
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:47.640]   that he could have in office. And I just think
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:50.640]   that's a really wrong way of looking at it. And,
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:53.880]   um, I mean, for example, I had this debate with
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:57.280]   Crystal and this gets to the whole Trump, you
[03:01:57.280 --> 03:01:59.320]   know, talking about the enemy from within. And
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:01.720]   she was like, he wants to prosecute his political
[03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:03.600]   opponents. Do you disagree with that? And I was
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:05.880]   like, no, I don't. And she was like, so you're
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:08.480]   not worried about it. And I go, no, I'm not. And
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:09.760]   she's like, well, how do you square that? And I
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:12.800]   was like, well, I actually unironically believe
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:15.680]   in the American system of institutional checks
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:17.960]   and balances, which kept him quote unquote in
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:21.120]   check last time around. I also believe in
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:23.920]   democracy where, you know, this is really
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:26.800]   interesting, but, you know, in 2022, a lot of the
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:29.200]   Republicans who were the most vociferous about
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:31.240]   stop the steal, they got their asses kicked at the
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:34.640]   ballot box. You know, Americans also then in
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:37.600]   2024 decided to forgive some of that from Donald
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:39.840]   Trump. It's definitely didn't help. Right. But
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:42.000]   they were able to oversee that for their own
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.080]   interests. As in democratically, people are
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:47.480]   able to weigh in terms of checks and balances,
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:49.160]   what they should and should not challenge a
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:51.800]   politician by. But also we have the American
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:54.880]   legal system. And I also know the way that the
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:57.720]   institutions in Washington themselves work, that,
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:01.040]   you know, fundamentally, the way that certain
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:03.640]   processes and other things could play out will not
[03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:07.960]   play out to some Hitlerian fantasy. And this gets
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:09.880]   to the whole like Kamala and them calling him a
[03:03:09.880 --> 03:03:12.880]   fascist and Hitler, you know, you and I probably
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:16.480]   spent hours of our lives, maybe more thinking and
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:19.760]   reading about Adolf Hitler, Weimar Germany, and I
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:22.480]   just find it so insulting, you know, because it
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:26.200]   becomes this moniker of like fascism. These terms
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:29.680]   have meaning beyond the beyond just the dictionary
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:32.640]   definition. The circumstances through which
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:36.600]   Hitler is able to rise to power are not the same as
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:40.800]   today. It's like stop denigrating America to the
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:42.880]   point where you think like really should flip it
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:45.080]   around. Why do you think America's Weimar Germany?
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:47.280]   That's a ridiculous thing to say. Do you
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:49.920]   unironically believe that? No, you don't believe
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:53.400]   that. So that is personally what drives me a
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:56.760]   little bit crazy. And I think that Sam has found
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:03:58.960]   himself in a mental framework where he is not
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:02.600]   willing, he's not able to look past the man and
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:05.880]   his quote unquote, danger. And at the end of the
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:08.880]   day, his worldview was rejected wholly by the
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:11.800]   American people. And that because the character
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:13.520]   argument, the fascist argument, the Hitler
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:16.480]   argument, the he is uniquely bad argument has been
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:20.320]   run twice before 2016. And in 2000, actually, all
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:23.240]   three times, I guess it won in 2020. But two out
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:24.840]   of the three times Donald Trump has won the
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:27.240]   presidency, and his latest one, where that
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:30.160]   argument has never been made before, for a longer
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:32.680]   period of time, and more in strength by a
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:35.360]   political candidate was rejected completely. And I
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:38.240]   would ask him to reconcile himself to the America
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:39.080]   that he lives in.
[03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:42.800]   I think one thing maybe to partially steal me on
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:46.000]   his case, but also just a steel man, the way the
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.520]   world works, is that there is some probability
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:55.120]   that Kamala Harris will institute a communist
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:57.840]   state. And there is some probability that Donald
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:01.800]   Trump will indeed, that like will fly a swastika
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:06.480]   with and deport, I don't know, everybody who's
[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:09.120]   not Scott Irish. Like, I don't know.
[03:05:09.120 --> 03:05:10.120]   Yeah, you and I are screwed then.
[03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:12.960]   Maybe, is there a spirit test? Okay. Like, but
[03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:15.800]   that probability is small. And you have to, if
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:18.000]   you allow yourself to focus on a particular
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:23.320]   trajectory with a small probability, it can
[03:05:23.320 --> 03:05:25.440]   become all encompassing. Because you could see
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:27.000]   it, you could see a path, there are certain
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:28.560]   character qualities to Trump.
[03:05:28.560 --> 03:05:29.040]   Yes.
[03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:32.000]   Where he wants to hold on to power. First of
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000]   all, every politician wants to hold on to power.
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:39.120]   Joe Biden, maybe because he's part of the
[03:05:39.120 --> 03:05:42.160]   machine, can't even conceive of the notion of a
[03:05:42.160 --> 03:05:45.040]   third term. But he has the arrogance to want to
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:46.960]   hold on to power, do everything he can.
[03:05:46.960 --> 03:05:47.800]   Absolutely.
[03:05:47.800 --> 03:05:50.080]   And like with Trump, I could see that if it was
[03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:53.600]   very popular for him to have a third term, I
[03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:56.840]   think he would not be the kind of person who
[03:05:56.840 --> 03:05:59.040]   doesn't advocate for a third term.
[03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:02.400]   So what, that would require the Senate and the
[03:06:02.400 --> 03:06:05.160]   House or 70, what is it, 75% of the states to
[03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:08.480]   pass and change the constitution. Do you think
[03:06:08.480 --> 03:06:09.760]   that's going to happen? No, I don't think it's
[03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:11.040]   going to happen. So I'm not that worried about
[03:06:11.040 --> 03:06:13.920]   it. Now you can make a norms argument. Actually,
[03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:15.720]   I think that's kind of fair, is that he's the
[03:06:15.720 --> 03:06:18.760]   norms buster. But, you know, with extraordinary
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:21.480]   candidates and people like Trump, you get the
[03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:24.200]   good and the bad. There is a true duality, like
[03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:26.920]   the norms he busts around foreign policy. I
[03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:29.680]   love the norms he busts around the economy. I
[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:33.120]   love the norms he busts around just so much of
[03:06:33.120 --> 03:06:34.840]   the American political system saying and how it
[03:06:34.840 --> 03:06:36.920]   is, et cetera. I love that. You know what I
[03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:39.720]   hate? This 2020 election bullshit. You know what
[03:06:39.720 --> 03:06:42.280]   else I hate? You know, this, I don't know, just
[03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:45.000]   the, the, the lack of discipline that I would
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.480]   want to think that a great leader could have,
[03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:49.000]   like when he was president and tweeting about
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.560]   Mika Brzezinski's facelift, that was objectively
[03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:53.840]   ridiculous. Like it was crazy. Okay. Was it
[03:06:53.840 --> 03:06:55.840]   funny? Yeah, but it was crazy. Like, and it's
[03:06:55.840 --> 03:06:59.680]   not how I would conceive and have conceived of
[03:06:59.680 --> 03:07:01.680]   some of my favorite presidents. I wouldn't
[03:07:01.680 --> 03:07:03.600]   think that they would do that, but that's what
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:05.520]   you get. You know, you, everyone should be
[03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:08.520]   clear eyed about who this man is. And that's
[03:07:08.520 --> 03:07:10.640]   another problem. The deification of politicians
[03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:13.200]   is second. It's sickening. Like about Trump
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:17.000]   around Obama or like these people are just
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.880]   people like the idea that they are God-like
[03:07:19.880 --> 03:07:22.320]   creatures with extraordinary judgment. You
[03:07:22.320 --> 03:07:23.680]   know, one of the really cool things about
[03:07:23.680 --> 03:07:25.000]   you and I's job is we actually get to meet,
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000]   meet very important people. After you meet a
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:28.080]   few billionaires, you're like, yeah, there's
[03:07:28.080 --> 03:07:30.040]   definitely something there, but you know, some
[03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:32.600]   of them get lucky. Um, and like, uh, after you
[03:07:32.600 --> 03:07:35.040]   meet a few politicians, you're like, oh, they're
[03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:36.920]   like, they're not that smart. Uh, that was a
[03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:38.680]   rude awakening for me, by the way, being here
[03:07:38.680 --> 03:07:40.760]   in Texas, reading about these people. And
[03:07:40.760 --> 03:07:43.120]   pretty soon I was on Capitol Hill. I was like
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:45.200]   19 years old. I was an intern. I'm actually
[03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:47.760]   interacting and I see them behave in ridiculous
[03:07:47.760 --> 03:07:49.680]   manners and you know, whatever, just treat
[03:07:49.680 --> 03:07:51.920]   people badly or say something stupid. And I
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:54.440]   was like, oh, this is not the West wing. I'm
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:07:56.560]   like, this is not like these people are just,
[03:07:56.560 --> 03:07:58.840]   this is reality. And the weirdest part of my
[03:07:58.840 --> 03:08:00.800]   life is I've now been in Washington long
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:03.680]   enough. I know some of the people personally,
[03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:06.120]   the vice president of the United States,
[03:08:06.120 --> 03:08:08.920]   literally the vice president elect, future
[03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:11.440]   cabinet secretaries, future, you know, these
[03:08:11.440 --> 03:08:13.520]   people I literally have met, had dinner with,
[03:08:13.520 --> 03:08:16.160]   had a drink with whatever. Um, that's a wild
[03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:18.680]   thing. And that's even more bringing you down
[03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:19.840]   to earth. You were like, oh shit, you're
[03:08:19.840 --> 03:08:21.560]   actually a lot of power. That's pretty, that's
[03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:24.080]   kind of scary, but you're just a person. And so
[03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:25.880]   even though you don't have to say, I have my
[03:08:25.880 --> 03:08:28.520]   same life experience, take it from me or
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:30.400]   anybody else who's ever met really famous
[03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:33.760]   people, rich, successful, powerful people.
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:35.400]   They're just people. There's nothing that
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:37.120]   there's some things that are unique about
[03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:40.040]   them, but, uh, they have just as many human
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:41.640]   qualities as you or anybody else who's
[03:08:41.640 --> 03:08:42.560]   listening to this right now.
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:45.640]   Yeah. There's a, for each candidate, Trump is
[03:08:45.640 --> 03:08:47.920]   probably the extreme version of that. There's
[03:08:47.920 --> 03:08:50.600]   a, there's a distribution of the possible
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:52.680]   trajectories that administration might result
[03:08:52.680 --> 03:08:55.720]   in. Yes. And like, uh, the range of possible
[03:08:55.720 --> 03:08:57.840]   trajectories is just much wider with Trump.
[03:08:57.840 --> 03:09:00.160]   Yeah. You're describing like a Bayesian theory,
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:02.200]   right? Like, and I think that's actually a
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:04.320]   really useful framework for the world is that
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:06.360]   people are really too binary. So like you said,
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:08.080]   you know, there's a theoretical possibility, I
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:11.160]   guess, of a communist takeover of government
[03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:14.600]   and of a fascist takeover of government under
[03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:17.200]   Kamala Harris or, uh, Donald Trump, you know,
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:19.080]   their realistic probability, I would give it
[03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:22.720]   0.05% probably in both directions. Um, but
[03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:24.320]   there are, you know, there are a lot of things
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:26.160]   that can happen that are bad, that are not
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:28.160]   Hitlerian or fascist. There are a lot of things
[03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:29.520]   that would happen that are really good, that
[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:33.000]   are not FDR new deal style. Uh, one of the worst
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.040]   things politicians do is they describe
[03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:38.440]   themselves in false historical ways. So in
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:40.840]   Washington, one of the most overused phrases is
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.680]   made history. And I'm like, you know, if you
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:47.560]   actually read history, most of these things are
[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:49.800]   just, they're not even footnotes. They're the
[03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:52.280]   stuff that the historians flip past. And they're
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:55.240]   like, what a stupid bucking thing. I mean, I'm
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:57.320]   talking about things that will, that ruled
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:09:59.440]   American politics. Like what if I told you that
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:01.480]   the Panama Canal treaty was one of the most
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:03.760]   important fights in modern American politics?
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:07.280]   Nobody thinks about that today. It ruled
[03:10:07.280 --> 03:10:09.480]   American politics at that time. You know, it
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:11.560]   genuinely is a footnote, but that's not how it
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:13.240]   felt at the time. So that's another thing I
[03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:14.040]   want people to take away.
[03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:19.480]   You, uh, tragically missed the UFO hearing.
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:23.520]   Oh man, my brothers, I'm really sad. Uh, I, let
[03:10:23.520 --> 03:10:26.920]   me tell you, I love them so much. The UFO
[03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:30.240]   community are some of the best people I've ever
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:32.600]   met in my life. Shout out to my brother, Jeremy
[03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:36.120]   Corbell, uh, to George Knapp, the OG, to all of
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:38.040]   the people who fly from all around the world to
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:40.680]   come to these hearings. It was so fun. I got to
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:42.960]   meet so many of them last time, just walk the
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:45.200]   rope line. Like as people were, uh, coming in
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:49.760]   the excitement, the, uh, I, I, I love, I truly
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:51.880]   love the UFO community. Shout out to all of them.
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:53.360]   This is the second one, I guess.
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:54.160]   This is the second one.
[03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:55.520]   Do you hope they continue happening?
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:10:57.600]   It's going to be a slow burn. Uh, so one of the
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:00.440]   things I always tell the guys and everybody is
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:05.400]   consider how long it took to understand the sheer
[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:09.560]   insanity of the CIA, the 1950s and sixties. So if
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:11.720]   we think back to the church committee, I don't, I
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:13.200]   forget the exact year of the church committee. I
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:15.080]   think it was in the seventies, uh, the entire
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:18.320]   church committee and knowledge of why this, of
[03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:21.960]   how the CIA and the FBI were up to all of this
[03:11:21.960 --> 03:11:24.440]   insane shit throughout the fifties and sixties is
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:26.800]   because some people broke into a warehouse,
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:29.240]   discovered some documents, got the names of
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:32.160]   programs, which were able to be foiled. And we
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:34.360]   were able to break open that case. It would never
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:36.760]   have happened with real transparency, like in the
[03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:39.360]   official process. So we owe those people a great
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:41.000]   debt. I guess I could say, no, the statute of
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:44.520]   limitations has passed. Uh, my point about the
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:48.000]   UFOs is I don't know what is real or not. I have
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.240]   absolute confidence, an absolute ton is being
[03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:52.680]   hid from the American people and that all of the
[03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:55.280]   official explanations are bullshit. I have had the
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:57.560]   opportunity to interface with some of the
[03:11:57.560 --> 03:11:59.840]   whistleblowers and other, the activists in the
[03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:02.840]   community, people who I trust, people who have
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:05.560]   great credentials, who have no reason to lie, who
[03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:08.160]   have assured us that there is a lot going on
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:10.280]   behind the scenes. There has been too much
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:13.040]   misinformation and effort by the deep state to
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:15.920]   cover up this topic. So I would ask people to
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:19.120]   keep the faith it's 2024 and we still don't have
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:21.800]   all the JFK files. Okay. Everyone involved is
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:24.200]   dead. There's no reason to let it go. And even
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:26.240]   though we basically know what happened, we don't
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:29.200]   know if you read that fantastic book, the Tom
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:31.800]   O'Neill book about the Manson murders. I mean,
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:34.000]   again, you know, it took him 20 years to write
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.200]   that book and he still didn't get the full story.
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:39.960]   So sometimes it takes an extraordinarily long,
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:42.760]   agonizing period of time. And I know how deeply
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:45.000]   frustrating that is. But when you think about a
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:48.120]   secret, a program and knowledge of this
[03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:50.760]   magnitude, it would only make sense that it would
[03:12:50.760 --> 03:12:53.880]   require a titanic effort to reveal a titanic
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:56.680]   secret. You think Trump might be able to push
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:12:59.840]   further, like aggressively break through the
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:02.960]   secrecy, let's say even on the JFK files? I hope
[03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:06.120]   so. I have moderate confidence, you know, RFK
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:08.440]   Jr has pushed him to do so. I would, I would
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:10.880]   like to think so. Uh, at the same time, my son
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:12.760]   got rolled last time. So, um, you know, I'll
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:14.480]   hold my breath. Why do you think that happens?
[03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:15.880]   Why do you think it gets, remember that whole
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:17.560]   interagency thing I told you about? That's how
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:19.160]   it happens. Uh, that's another thing. You're
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:20.840]   presuming that the president has the power to
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:23.240]   declassify this stuff. I'm, I'm saying that I'm
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:25.480]   not even sure we're there, like in terms of, uh,
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:27.880]   so it's basically like stability. He basically
[03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:31.080]   says, like, I would like to declassify JFK files.
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:33.120]   And they say, yes, sir, we'll get that to you in
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:35.720]   three months and three months comes by. And then
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:38.080]   they're like, well, there's these, uh, hurdles.
[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:39.840]   Well, the way you get around it is go, let's
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.840]   release some, but these in particular, there's
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:43.880]   national security secrets is a good case for not
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:45.720]   releasing them X, Y, and Z. You know, it's like
[03:13:45.720 --> 03:13:47.680]   you get around that. Oh, okay. You know, that
[03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:49.680]   makes sense. You know, again, he's a busy guy.
[03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:51.040]   He's the president. He got way bigger shit to
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:53.040]   worry about. So this is the, that's the problem
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:55.960]   is that unless you have that true urgency, I mean,
[03:13:55.960 --> 03:13:58.680]   look, people of immense power have tried. Everyone
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:01.040]   forgets this. John Podesta was the white house
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:03.720]   chief of staff. He is a UFO true believer in his
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:06.960]   heart. He tried, he's talked about it. He tried
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:09.640]   at the top level, the number two to the white
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:12.240]   house to get the Pentagon and others to tell him
[03:14:12.240 --> 03:14:14.040]   what was going on and they stonewalled him. So
[03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:16.360]   people need to understand what you're up against.
[03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:19.040]   And you know, I would, and people are like, how
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:21.200]   is that even possible? It's like, well, go read
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:25.080]   about the terror that LBJ and the Kennedys and
[03:14:25.080 --> 03:14:28.520]   others had in confronting J Edgar Hoover, go and
[03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:32.440]   read how terrified, you know, Eisenhower and some
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:34.280]   of them were, were of the Dulles brothers. They
[03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:36.560]   were scared. Like they, they knew where the power
[03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:40.640]   lies. So, you know, the presidency, um, look,
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:43.520]   government, deep state, et cetera. They've been
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:45.440]   there a long time and they know what's happening.
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:48.680]   And presidents come and go, but they stay forever.
[03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:52.360]   And so, uh, that's, that's the paradigm that
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:53.320]   you're going to have to fight against.
[03:14:53.320 --> 03:14:56.360]   Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a, it's a bit of a meme,
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:15:00.720]   but I wonder how deep the deep state is, um, much
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:02.800]   deeper than anyone can even imagine. And the
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:05.160]   worst part is, but the deep state is, it's not
[03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:07.640]   even individuals. It's actually an ideology and
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:09.880]   ideology is the most powerful, you know, people
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:12.960]   often think that if we took money out of politics,
[03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:14.120]   that it would change everything. I'm not saying
[03:15:14.120 --> 03:15:16.520]   it wouldn't change everything, but it wouldn't
[03:15:16.520 --> 03:15:19.520]   change a lot, but people are like, Oh, so-and-so
[03:15:19.520 --> 03:15:21.000]   is only against universal healthcare. Cause
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:22.320]   they're getting paid. I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:24.040]   That's not why they actually believe it. Or it's
[03:15:24.040 --> 03:15:26.280]   like, Oh, so-and-so is only, Oh, wants to
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.440]   advocate for war with Iran because they're on
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:30.440]   the payroll of AIPAC. And it's like, well, yeah,
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:32.760]   the AIPAC trips and the money helps, but they
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:35.280]   think that actually the system itself, this is a
[03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:39.080]   very Chomsky ass systemic critique is that any
[03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:41.560]   journalist worth their salt would never have the
[03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:43.960]   ability to get hired in a mainstream. So he's
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:45.960]   like, it's not that you're bad in the mainstream
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:49.400]   media. It's that anyone good is not allowed to be
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:52.240]   elevated to your position because they have an
[03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:55.400]   ideology. And so, you know, that is the most
[03:15:55.400 --> 03:15:58.440]   self-reinforcing pernicious mechanism of them
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:00.440]   all. And that's really Washington in a nutshell.
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:04.480]   It's a, it's again, a bubble, but a bubble that
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:07.440]   has a lot of power. Yes. Who do you think is the
[03:16:07.440 --> 03:16:10.280]   future of the Republican party after Trump? What
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:13.240]   happens to Trumpism after Trump? Like you just
[03:16:13.240 --> 03:16:16.120]   said, Bayesian let's take various theories. Uh,
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:19.360]   right. So let's say it's Oh four, uh, it's Bush
[03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:23.200]   Cheney in 2004, the day after the election, I
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:24.800]   would have told you this, we live in a Bible
[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:27.520]   belt, Jesus land, America, this America wants to
[03:16:27.520 --> 03:16:32.200]   protect America, a war on terror against Iraq. Um,
[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:36.000]   and uh, the axis of evil and American people just
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.040]   voted for George W. Bush. And so I would have
[03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:40.760]   predicted that it would have been somebody in
[03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:42.520]   that vein. And they tried that his name was John
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:44.160]   McCain. He got blown the fuck out by Barack
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:47.200]   Obama. So I cannot sit here and confidently say
[03:16:47.200 --> 03:16:49.240]   what year would you be able to predict Obama was
[03:16:49.240 --> 03:16:52.080]   just his first time he gave the speech, the 2004
[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:54.120]   speech at the DNC. That was his, we don't live in
[03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:56.520]   a black America, white America, the John Kerry
[03:16:56.520 --> 03:16:59.840]   DNC speech. You honestly could not have predicted
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:02.080]   it until Oh seven, whenever he actually announced
[03:17:02.080 --> 03:17:04.840]   his campaign and activated a lot of anti-war
[03:17:04.840 --> 03:17:07.360]   energy. I mean, maybe Oh six, actually I could
[03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:09.880]   have said in Oh six, if I was, you know, kind of
[03:17:09.880 --> 03:17:11.640]   the contrarian man now, and I'm like, yeah,
[03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:13.240]   there's a lot of anti-war energy. I think the
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:15.320]   next president will be somebody who's able to
[03:17:15.320 --> 03:17:17.560]   vote, you know, the explosion of Keith Olbermann
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:20.360]   and MSNBC that it makes logical sense in
[03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:22.600]   hindsight. But you know, at the same time, you're
[03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:24.760]   going up against the Clinton machine who's never
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:28.160]   lost an election. So I would have been afraid. Um,
[03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:31.080]   I cannot confidently say, so I will say if things
[03:17:31.080 --> 03:17:33.600]   go in different directions, if Trump is a net
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:35.680]   positive president, then I think it will be JD
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:39.280]   Vance, his vice president, um, who believes in
[03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:41.240]   the, uh, a lot of the things that I've talked
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:43.280]   about here today about foreign policy restraint,
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:46.040]   about the working class, about changing
[03:17:46.040 --> 03:17:49.720]   Republican attitudes to the economy. Um, and he
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:51.920]   would be able to build upon that legacy in the
[03:17:51.920 --> 03:17:54.120]   way that George W. H. W. Bush was able to get
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:56.520]   elected off the back of Reagan. But H. W. Bush
[03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:58.480]   was fundamentally his own man. He's a very
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:18:00.520]   misunderstood figure, very different than Ronald
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:02.840]   Reagan. Um, didn't end up working out for him,
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:04.960]   but you know, he did get himself elected once.
[03:18:04.960 --> 03:18:07.000]   So that's one path. That's if you have a net
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.960]   positive Trump presidency. The other path is the
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:13.080]   oh four path that I just laid out. Uh, if George
[03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:15.400]   W. Bush, if Trump does what Bush does,
[03:18:15.400 --> 03:18:17.920]   misinterprets his mandate, screws things up,
[03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:21.440]   creates chaos, um, and it makes it just generally
[03:18:21.440 --> 03:18:24.440]   annoying to live in American society, then you
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:27.400]   will see somebody in the Republican party. I
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:29.560]   mean, still, it could even be JD Vance cause he
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:31.880]   could say JD is my natural and my chosen
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:34.720]   successor, but then he would lose an election
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:36.520]   and then he would no longer be the so-called
[03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:39.840]   leader of the Republican party. So, uh, I could
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:42.160]   see it swing in the other direction. I could see,
[03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:44.880]   uh, you know, Republicans or others, let's say
[03:18:44.880 --> 03:18:47.240]   if it's a total disaster and we get down to like
[03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:50.240]   20% approval ratings and the economy is bad and
[03:18:50.240 --> 03:18:54.160]   stuff like that, Glenn Yunkin or, uh, somebody
[03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:57.240]   like that, who's very diametrically opposed to
[03:18:57.240 --> 03:18:59.680]   Donald Trump, uh, or at least, you know,
[03:18:59.680 --> 03:19:01.680]   aesthetically is somebody like that who could
[03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:03.880]   rise from the ashes. And I'm just saying like,
[03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:06.600]   in terms of his aesthetic, not him per se. So
[03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:08.760]   there's a variety of different directions. Um,
[03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:11.120]   it's a big question about the Republican base. I
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:13.480]   mean, a shit ton of people voted Republican now
[03:19:13.480 --> 03:19:16.120]   for the first time ever. So are they going to
[03:19:16.120 --> 03:19:18.000]   vote in party primaries? I don't know. You know,
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.720]   the traditional party primary voter is like a
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:24.960]   white boomer. It's like 58, 59. Uh, is the Latino
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:27.160]   guy in California who turned out to vote for
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:29.880]   Trump with a MAGA hat and rolling around, you
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:32.640]   know, suburban Los Angeles with that, is he going
[03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:34.600]   to vote in the Republican party that could change?
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:36.880]   So the type of candidate themselves could come.
[03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:38.840]   So this just, it's way too early to say, you
[03:19:38.840 --> 03:19:41.240]   know, we have so many variety of paths that we
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:41.920]   go down.
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:45.240]   Yeah. I think, I think Trump is a singular figure
[03:19:45.240 --> 03:19:51.480]   in terms of like, if you support Trump there, I
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:55.720]   just, there's a vibe. I know Kamala has a vibe,
[03:19:55.720 --> 03:19:58.960]   but there's definitely a vibe to Trump and MAGA.
[03:19:58.960 --> 03:20:03.680]   And I just, I think even with JD that that's no
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:06.520]   longer going to be there. So if JD runs and wins,
[03:20:06.800 --> 03:20:09.880]   that would be on principles and it's a very
[03:20:09.880 --> 03:20:10.760]   different human being.
[03:20:10.760 --> 03:20:13.720]   He is so different than Trump, right? You can see
[03:20:13.720 --> 03:20:16.200]   his empathy, right? Remember in the VP debate,
[03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:18.040]   when he was like, Christ have mercy, when Tim
[03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:19.320]   Wallace was talking about his son. I mean, that's
[03:20:19.320 --> 03:20:20.840]   not something Donald Trump would say. Okay. It's
[03:20:20.840 --> 03:20:24.920]   just not like, uh, in terms of, I mean, you know,
[03:20:24.920 --> 03:20:26.920]   and this, by the way, this is my own bubble test.
[03:20:26.920 --> 03:20:29.160]   I have no idea how somebody listens to Trump and
[03:20:29.160 --> 03:20:30.880]   JD Vance is like, Trump is the guy who should be
[03:20:30.880 --> 03:20:33.400]   the president over him. I honestly, I don't get
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:36.360]   it. That's my own cards on the table. I am in too
[03:20:36.360 --> 03:20:40.480]   much of a bubble where I'm, my bias is to, you
[03:20:40.480 --> 03:20:44.680]   know, being well-spoken and being empathetic, or
[03:20:44.680 --> 03:20:46.640]   at least being able to play empathetic and being
[03:20:46.640 --> 03:20:49.360]   extremely well read about the world and thoughtful
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:51.280]   and, uh, somebody who's, you know, somebody like
[03:20:51.280 --> 03:20:53.280]   him, who's engaged in the political process, but
[03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:55.400]   also has been able to retain his values and be
[03:20:55.400 --> 03:20:58.000]   extremely well articulate his worldview. That's my
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:00.920]   bias. That's who I would want to be the president.
[03:21:00.920 --> 03:21:03.240]   But you know, you know, it's a big country. People
[03:21:03.240 --> 03:21:03.680]   think differently.
[03:21:03.680 --> 03:21:06.280]   By the way, I share your bias. And I sometimes
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:08.600]   try to take myself out of that bubble. Like it's
[03:21:08.600 --> 03:21:11.480]   maybe it's not important to have read a book or
[03:21:11.480 --> 03:21:15.000]   multiples of books on history.
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.360]   I'm not saying everybody should be like me, but
[03:21:17.360 --> 03:21:19.200]   that's my point. I'm checking myself by being
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:21.680]   like, because of who I am, that's how I see the
[03:21:21.680 --> 03:21:23.640]   world. And that's how I would choose a leader.
[03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:27.520]   But that is not how people vote, period. Nothing
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:29.200]   has taught me that more than this election.
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:31.440]   I wish they did. I mean, I don't know if that, I
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:32.800]   don't know if that's a lesson to take away. I
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:33.080]   think.
[03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:34.720]   Yeah, but who are we to say? People are allowed
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:36.040]   to do what they want. And I'm not going to tell
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:36.760]   somebody how to vote.
[03:21:36.760 --> 03:21:39.320]   No, what I'm saying is you take everything Trump.
[03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:43.560]   Everything Trump is doing, everything, the whole
[03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:48.000]   the dance, all of it, and add occasional saga
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:51.320]   like references to history books. I think that's
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:52.440]   just a better candidate.
[03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:54.800]   I agree with you. I mean, listen, you know, it's
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:55.680]   my bias.
[03:21:55.680 --> 03:21:58.160]   Yeah, I don't know. I don't think that's bias. I
[03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:00.920]   think I think that's not a bubble thinking. I
[03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:02.960]   think it's amazing to me. Right. Like, listen to
[03:22:02.960 --> 03:22:06.280]   the J.D. interview with Rogan. I mean, J.D., I
[03:22:06.280 --> 03:22:11.040]   mean, he'll drop obscure references to studies, to
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:15.320]   like papers that have come out, essays, books
[03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:19.240]   like this is a very well read, high IQ, well
[03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:22.920]   thought out individual who also, you know, has
[03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:25.440]   given his life to the political process and
[03:22:25.440 --> 03:22:28.640]   decided to like deal with all the bullshit that
[03:22:28.640 --> 03:22:30.480]   this entire system is going to throw at you
[03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:33.400]   whenever you start to engage. That's who I would
[03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:35.240]   want to be president. But, you know, I'm biased.
[03:22:35.240 --> 03:22:36.000]   So what can I say?
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.560]   I like how you keep saying you're biased, as if
[03:22:38.560 --> 03:22:40.240]   there's some percent of the population doesn't
[03:22:40.240 --> 03:22:44.280]   like people to read at all. Okay. What about the
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:46.120]   future? You kind of hinted at it, the future of
[03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:49.320]   the Democratic Party. Do you see any talent out
[03:22:49.320 --> 03:22:51.120]   there that's promising? Is it going to be Obama
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:52.920]   like figure that just rolls out of nowhere?
[03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:55.440]   Clinton is the better example, because the
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:22:57.640]   Democratic Party was destroyed for 12 years.
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:02.240]   From 1980, the 1980 election to 1992, they're 12
[03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:06.520]   years out of power. In periods of that long of an
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:09.640]   era, it takes somebody literally brand new who is
[03:23:09.640 --> 03:23:12.400]   not tainted by the previous to convince the base
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:13.960]   that you can want and convince the country that
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:16.960]   you're going in a new direction. So I would not
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:19.480]   put my money on anybody tainted by the Great
[03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:23.160]   Awakening, by TDS, by the insanity of the Trump
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:26.240]   era, that has to be somebody post that and or
[03:23:26.240 --> 03:23:28.880]   somebody who is able to reform themselves. It
[03:23:28.880 --> 03:23:32.040]   will, it will, in my opinion, it will likely not
[03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:35.880]   be any establishment politician of today, who
[03:23:35.880 --> 03:23:38.840]   will emerge for the future. Like I said, my dark
[03:23:38.840 --> 03:23:41.160]   horse is Dean. I think that the I think the
[03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:43.080]   Democratic base is going to give Dean a shit ton
[03:23:43.080 --> 03:23:45.560]   of credit, and they should for him being out.
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:48.200]   Look, let's be honest, he's a no name congressman
[03:23:48.200 --> 03:23:50.600]   from Minnesota. Nobody cared who Dean Phillips
[03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:53.560]   was. But just like Obama, he had courage, and he
[03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:56.040]   came out and spoke early when it mattered. And by
[03:23:56.040 --> 03:23:58.120]   doing that, he showed good judgment, and he
[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:00.600]   showed that he's willing to take risks. So I
[03:24:00.600 --> 03:24:02.320]   would hope in America's political system that we
[03:24:02.320 --> 03:24:04.280]   award something like that. And I do think the
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:06.600]   Democrats will reward him, but I'm not saying it
[03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:09.480]   will be him per se. But it will be a figure like
[03:24:09.480 --> 03:24:13.360]   that, who is not nationally known, who has read
[03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:15.760]   the tea leaves correctly, who took guesses and
[03:24:15.760 --> 03:24:18.240]   did things differently than everybody else. And
[03:24:18.240 --> 03:24:22.160]   most of all, I'm hoping that heterodox attitudes,
[03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:25.920]   ideas, behaviors, by definition, after a blowout,
[03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:28.160]   those will likely be the ones that are rewarded.
[03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:29.960]   So I cannot give a name, but I can just describe
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:31.320]   the circumstances for what it will look like.
[03:24:31.320 --> 03:24:33.680]   Can you imagine an amorphous figure that's a
[03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:35.640]   progressive populist?
[03:24:35.640 --> 03:24:38.360]   It would be very difficult at this point, just
[03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:41.440]   because a huge portion of the multiracial working
[03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:45.440]   class has shifted to the right. But I could see
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:47.320]   it. I mean, look, people change their minds all
[03:24:47.320 --> 03:24:49.680]   the time. Like there are people out there who
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:51.840]   voted for Barack Obama, who've now voted for
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:54.480]   Donald Trump three times. So, you know, a lot can
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:24:56.760]   change in this country. If you make a credible
[03:24:56.760 --> 03:24:58.680]   case, you've got a track record, speak
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:02.200]   authentically, and you can try to divide the
[03:25:02.200 --> 03:25:05.680]   country along class lines and be authentic and
[03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:08.280]   real about it. Maybe, I think you have a shot. I
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:10.240]   still think you're probably gonna get dinged on
[03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:12.520]   culture, just because I think this election has
[03:25:12.520 --> 03:25:14.200]   really showed us how important immigration and
[03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:18.000]   culture is. But you know, actually, what the left
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.120]   populace should pray for, and they won't admit
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:22.320]   this, is that Trump actually solves immigration,
[03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:24.960]   like in terms of changing the status quo. You know
[03:25:24.960 --> 03:25:28.000]   how in the way that the Supreme Court just ended
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:29.800]   the conversation around gay marriage? So
[03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:31.200]   Republicans were like, "Yeah, whatever. We
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:33.040]   support gay marriage." Because like, that's the
[03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:35.400]   law of the land. It is what it is. They should
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:38.960]   just hope that their unpopular issue is resolved
[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:41.160]   by the president. And thus, they just don't have
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:42.960]   to talk about it anymore. And now the
[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:45.080]   battleground is actually favorable for them. They
[03:25:45.080 --> 03:25:47.240]   get to talk about the economy and abortion. So
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:49.680]   their most, their least popular issue gets
[03:25:49.680 --> 03:25:52.320]   solved by the president by consensus from his
[03:25:52.320 --> 03:25:54.520]   mandate, and then they can run on a brand new
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:25:56.240]   platform for the new issues that are facing
[03:25:56.240 --> 03:25:56.760]   America.
[03:25:56.760 --> 03:25:59.440]   All right, let's put our historian hat back on.
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:25:59.920]   Okay.
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:03.120]   Will the American Empire collapse one day? And if
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:06.880]   it does, when it does, what will be the reason?
[03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:14.120]   Statistically, likely. Statistically, yes. You
[03:26:14.120 --> 03:26:15.840]   know, it's the famous Fight Club quote, it's like
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:17.720]   on a long enough timeline, the survival rate for
[03:26:17.720 --> 03:26:21.560]   everything drops to zero. And you know...
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:24.320]   I like for all the books you've quoted, you went
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:26.080]   to Fight Club. I guess the movie, right?
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:27.520]   The book is good, though. People should read that
[03:26:27.520 --> 03:26:32.360]   too. In terms of why, again, statistically, the
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:35.120]   answer is quite simple. It usually comes back to
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:40.320]   a series of unpopular wars, which are pursued
[03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:45.520]   because of the elites' interests. Then it usually
[03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:49.640]   leads to a miscalculation and not a catastrophic
[03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:55.320]   defeat. Normally, it comes gradually. And most of
[03:26:55.320 --> 03:26:58.040]   the times when these things end, the crazy part is
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:26:59.840]   most people who are living through end of empire
[03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:01.480]   have no idea that they're living through the end
[03:27:01.480 --> 03:27:03.240]   of the empire. And I actually think about that a
[03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:05.560]   lot from, you know, Decline and Fall of the Roman
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:08.400]   Empire by Edward Gibbon. Actually, your episode
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:09.920]   on Rome was fantastic. People should go listen
[03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:12.720]   to that. So there you go. Another really good
[03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:14.120]   one, I like to think a lot about the British
[03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:17.480]   Empire and what eventually led to that collapse.
[03:27:17.480 --> 03:27:21.520]   And nobody in 1919 said the British Empire has
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:24.200]   just collapsed. Basically, nobody thought that.
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:25.920]   They were like, yeah, the First World War is
[03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:28.760]   horrible, but actually we came out of this OK. We
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:30.120]   still have India. You know, we still have all
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:32.760]   these African colonies and all that. But, you
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:35.720]   know, long periods of servitude, of debt to the
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:38.640]   United States, of degradation, of social
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:42.080]   upheaval, of Bolshevism, of American industrial
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:45.120]   might. And next thing you know, you find
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:47.880]   yourself at Potsdam and Churchill's like, holy
[03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:50.880]   shit, I have barely any power in this room. Right.
[03:27:50.880 --> 03:27:53.200]   So it revolutions happen slowly and then all at
[03:27:53.200 --> 03:27:57.120]   once. And so could you really put a, you know, a
[03:27:57.120 --> 03:27:59.360]   real like pain in the end of the British Empire?
[03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:02.120]   It took almost 40 years for for it to end. So
[03:28:02.120 --> 03:28:06.160]   America's empire will eventually end either from
[03:28:06.160 --> 03:28:09.000]   rising geopolitical competition. Likely China
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:12.040]   could be India. Nobody knows. It will likely be
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:16.000]   because of being overstretched of an elite
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:20.280]   capture is usually the reason why. And a
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:23.680]   misreading of what made your original society
[03:28:23.680 --> 03:28:26.360]   work, you know, in the first place. And that is
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:29.080]   one where I honestly like all three of those
[03:28:29.080 --> 03:28:31.280]   things will happen all at once and it will happen
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:34.360]   over an extremely long period of time. And it's
[03:28:34.360 --> 03:28:36.040]   very difficult to predict. I would not bet
[03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:37.680]   against America right now. I think we have a lot
[03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:39.520]   of fundamental strengths. It's a unique and
[03:28:39.520 --> 03:28:42.280]   dynamic country. It really is fucking crazy. Every
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:44.880]   time I travel the world, as much as I love all
[03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:47.080]   these different places, I go, man, I just I love
[03:28:47.080 --> 03:28:49.840]   the United States so much. You will love it more
[03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:52.040]   when you leave. I really believe that. So yeah.
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:56.560]   And it's nice to remember how quickly the public
[03:28:56.560 --> 03:28:58.720]   opinion shifts, like we're very dynamic and
[03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:01.560]   adaptable, which annoys me. I understand that's
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:03.480]   part of the political discourse saying, like, if
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:06.320]   Trump wins, it's the end of America. If Kamala
[03:29:06.320 --> 03:29:08.960]   wins, it's the end of America. So stupid. Yeah.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.600]   But I understand that the radical nature of that
[03:29:11.600 --> 03:29:14.840]   discourse is necessary to like you mentioned.
[03:29:14.840 --> 03:29:17.160]   Yeah. To drive out votes. To drive out votes.
[03:29:17.160 --> 03:29:19.800]   I like to think about Americans in 1866. I
[03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:22.000]   cannot imagine going through a war where some
[03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:23.720]   X percent, I think it's like two or three percent
[03:29:23.720 --> 03:29:25.400]   or whatever, the entire population was just
[03:29:25.400 --> 03:29:28.440]   killed. Our president, who was this visionary
[03:29:28.440 --> 03:29:31.640]   genius who we're blessed to have, is assassinated
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:34.280]   in Forks Theater immediately after the surrender
[03:29:34.280 --> 03:29:36.960]   of Lee. Andrew Johnson, who's a bumbling like
[03:29:36.960 --> 03:29:40.440]   fucked hard is the one who is in charge. And, you
[03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:43.120]   know, we're having all these insane crises over
[03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:46.480]   like internal management while we're also trying
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:48.880]   to decide like this new order in the South and
[03:29:48.880 --> 03:29:50.560]   whether to bring these people how to bring these
[03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:53.200]   people back into the union. I mean, I would have
[03:29:53.200 --> 03:29:56.560]   despaired. Yeah, I was like, it's over. This is
[03:29:56.560 --> 03:29:58.800]   it. You know, the war. I'm like, was it worth
[03:29:58.800 --> 03:30:00.760]   anything? You know, if Andrew Johnson is going
[03:30:00.760 --> 03:30:02.880]   to be doing this or even in the South, I mean, I
[03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:05.200]   can't even imagine for what they were going
[03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:07.240]   through to, you know, they have to go home and
[03:30:07.240 --> 03:30:09.040]   their entire cities are burned to the ground and
[03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:10.720]   they're trying to readjust. And, you know, their
[03:30:10.720 --> 03:30:13.560]   entire economy and way of life is overthrown in
[03:30:13.560 --> 03:30:16.360]   five years. I mean, that's an insane time to be
[03:30:16.360 --> 03:30:19.000]   alive. And what do we know? It worked out, you
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:23.600]   know, by 1890s or so there were people shaking
[03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:26.200]   hands, you know, union. And there's a there's a
[03:30:26.200 --> 03:30:30.000]   cool video on YouTube actually of FDR who is
[03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:32.480]   addressing some of the last Gettysburg veterans.
[03:30:32.480 --> 03:30:34.360]   I think it was like the 75th anniversary or
[03:30:34.360 --> 03:30:36.280]   whatever. And you can literally see these old
[03:30:36.280 --> 03:30:40.360]   men shaking hands across the stone wall. It gives
[03:30:40.360 --> 03:30:44.200]   me hope. Yeah, let's linger on that hope. What is
[03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:48.120]   the source of optimism you have for the 21st
[03:30:48.120 --> 03:30:51.880]   century for the century beyond that for human
[03:30:51.880 --> 03:30:55.440]   civilization in general is, you know, it's easy
[03:30:55.440 --> 03:30:59.840]   to learn cynical lessons from history, right? The
[03:30:59.840 --> 03:31:02.960]   shit eventually goes wrong, but sometimes it
[03:31:02.960 --> 03:31:06.960]   doesn't. So what gives you hope? I think that the
[03:31:06.960 --> 03:31:12.720]   the fundamentals of what makes humanity great and
[03:31:12.720 --> 03:31:15.520]   has for a long time are best expressed in the
[03:31:15.520 --> 03:31:18.800]   American character. And that despite all of our
[03:31:18.800 --> 03:31:23.160]   problems, that as a country with our ethos, a lot
[03:31:23.160 --> 03:31:25.480]   of stuff we talked about today, individualism,
[03:31:25.480 --> 03:31:27.920]   the frontier mindset, the blessings of geography,
[03:31:27.920 --> 03:31:31.120]   the blessings of our economy, of the way that
[03:31:31.120 --> 03:31:33.080]   we're able to just incorporate different cultures
[03:31:33.080 --> 03:31:35.680]   and the best of each and put them all together,
[03:31:35.680 --> 03:31:38.880]   give us the best opportunity to succeed and to
[03:31:38.880 --> 03:31:41.440]   accomplish awesome things. We're the country
[03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:44.000]   that put a man on the moon, which is the epitome
[03:31:44.000 --> 03:31:48.320]   of human spirit. I hope to see more of that. And
[03:31:48.320 --> 03:31:49.800]   you know, I think last time I was here, I
[03:31:49.800 --> 03:31:52.080]   shouted out and I love Antarctic exploration.
[03:31:52.080 --> 03:31:53.920]   I've read basically every book that there is on
[03:31:53.920 --> 03:31:56.200]   the exploration of Antarctica. And one of the
[03:31:56.200 --> 03:31:59.080]   reasons I love to do so is because there is no
[03:31:59.120 --> 03:32:01.520]   reason to care about Antarctica. None. There's
[03:32:01.520 --> 03:32:04.280]   nothing down there. Zero. Going to the South Pole
[03:32:04.280 --> 03:32:09.840]   is a truly useless exercise. And yet we went, we
[03:32:09.840 --> 03:32:11.920]   went twice. Actually, two people went there within
[03:32:11.920 --> 03:32:13.880]   the span of five weeks and they competed to do
[03:32:13.880 --> 03:32:18.840]   so. And the spirit that propelled Amundsen and
[03:32:18.840 --> 03:32:21.280]   Scott's expedition and people like Shackleton,
[03:32:21.280 --> 03:32:23.920]   who is like, if you were to ask me, my hero of
[03:32:23.920 --> 03:32:26.600]   all heroes, it's Ernest Shackleton, is because
[03:32:26.600 --> 03:32:29.760]   his spirit, I think, lives on in the United
[03:32:29.760 --> 03:32:31.880]   States. It unfortunately died in Great Britain.
[03:32:31.880 --> 03:32:34.840]   And interestingly enough, the Brits even
[03:32:34.840 --> 03:32:36.080]   understand that. They're like, it's very
[03:32:36.080 --> 03:32:37.920]   interesting how popular Shackleton is in
[03:32:37.920 --> 03:32:41.800]   America. And even though he was Irish and he was
[03:32:41.800 --> 03:32:44.000]   a British subject, to me, he's a spiritual
[03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:46.160]   American. And I think that his his spirit lives
[03:32:46.160 --> 03:32:49.040]   on within us and has always been here to a
[03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:51.960]   certain extent. And everywhere else, I think
[03:32:51.960 --> 03:32:55.760]   it's dying. But here, I love it here. There's so
[03:32:55.760 --> 03:32:57.120]   many cool things about America. People move
[03:32:57.120 --> 03:32:58.960]   around all the time, they buy new houses, they
[03:32:58.960 --> 03:33:01.240]   start families. They, there's no other place
[03:33:01.240 --> 03:33:02.800]   you can just reset your whole life. In the same
[03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:05.680]   country, it's wild. You can reinvent yourself,
[03:33:05.680 --> 03:33:07.720]   you can go broke, you can get rich, you can go
[03:33:07.720 --> 03:33:10.440]   back and forth multiple times. And there's
[03:33:10.440 --> 03:33:12.000]   nobody there, there's nowhere else where you
[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:14.680]   have enough freedom and opportunity to pursue
[03:33:14.680 --> 03:33:16.960]   that. I definitely have a lot of problems, but
[03:33:16.960 --> 03:33:19.280]   I've traveled enough of the world now to know
[03:33:19.280 --> 03:33:22.080]   that it's a special place. And that gives me a
[03:33:22.080 --> 03:33:22.480]   lot of hope.
[03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:25.640]   I wish I could do a Bostonian accent of
[03:33:25.640 --> 03:33:27.880]   "We do these things, not because they're easy,
[03:33:27.880 --> 03:33:28.680]   but because they're hard."
[03:33:28.680 --> 03:33:29.560]   Because they're hard.
[03:33:29.560 --> 03:33:30.280]   Thank you.
[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:36.680]   That's so true. The Scott Irish got us. Well,
[03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:40.120]   listen, I'm a huge fan of your saga. I hope to
[03:33:40.120 --> 03:33:43.240]   see you in the White House interviewing the
[03:33:43.240 --> 03:33:43.680]   president.
[03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:45.880]   There you go. That's the only situation you're
[03:33:45.880 --> 03:33:46.840]   gonna see me in the White House.
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:54.320]   Front row and just talking free. I would just, I
[03:33:54.320 --> 03:33:57.520]   would love to live in a country and in a world
[03:33:57.520 --> 03:34:01.800]   where it's you who gets to talk to the press
[03:34:01.800 --> 03:34:05.400]   secretary, to the president. Because I think
[03:34:05.400 --> 03:34:08.080]   you're a real, you're one of the good ones, as
[03:34:08.080 --> 03:34:09.880]   far as journalists go, as far as human beings.
[03:34:09.880 --> 03:34:12.280]   So I hope to see you in there. And I hope you
[03:34:12.280 --> 03:34:14.680]   get to ask a question that-
[03:34:14.680 --> 03:34:16.400]   That ends up in a book.
[03:34:16.400 --> 03:34:18.120]   That ends up in a good history book.
[03:34:18.120 --> 03:34:20.360]   Absolutely. Well, likewise, I'm a huge fan of
[03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:22.760]   yours. For anybody out there who's interested, I
[03:34:22.760 --> 03:34:25.240]   compiled a list and I will go and retroactively
[03:34:25.240 --> 03:34:28.880]   edit it. Just go to sagaandjetty.io. I created a
[03:34:28.880 --> 03:34:31.160]   newsletter with a website that has all the links
[03:34:31.160 --> 03:34:32.480]   to all the books I'm gonna talk about here.
[03:34:32.480 --> 03:34:34.160]   Beautiful. The hundreds of books that were
